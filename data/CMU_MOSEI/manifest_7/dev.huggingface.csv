"(umm) What youre watching right now is the scene where (uhh) this monster, this (uhh) sea creature is first found",-2
(umm) Where its about to drop in the water and (uhh) mayhem begins,1
(uhh) But basically its the story of a dysfunctional Japanese family that (uhh) ends up coming together in order to save (uhh) the young girl that is (uhh) taken (uhh) by this (uhh) sea monster,1
(uhh) I definitely would not recommend it,1
(uhh) We actually had to skip through some of the movie because it just got so drawn out,1
(uhh) But (uhh) if you enjoy seeing foreign films (umm) you might (uhh) have a little fun with it,-2
"(uhh) We (uhh) enjoyed seeing the (uhh) the subtitles (uhh) versus the, the (stutter) dubbed voices, dubbed American voices (uhh) and how the dialogue (uhh) differed from the subtitles on the screen",0
(umm) and so you might enjoy that,0
(uhh) But all in all its its (stutter) not a very good movie and so I would not recommend it,1

But now I think our . . . our hardest work is . . . legitimacy.,0
Making sure that we don’t just build the engaging game but that we’re articulate about our reasoning and our purpose for wanting to do it.,0
Um . . . especially having discovered in the last year that many people in the community are going to have a negative . . . sometimes I’d say even knee-jerk reaction to the idea of playing games and trading cards and having sparkleponies in the context of a professional conference.,1
"Hi, Im here to review the movie When Worlds Collide",0
(umm) There are really no known actors are in this movie,-1
(umm) Its directed by George Pal who did many other (uhh) science fiction movies during the fifties,0
"In it, an astronomer discovers a planet and its moon are in a direct collision course (uhh) with the earth",1
He goes to the world governments who think hes a crackpot and really have no interest in building a rocket ship to try to (uhh) save a few people kind of like a Noahs arc to another planet,0
So he goes to private invest investors (stutter) and a few millionaires (uhh) decide yes (uhh) the human population is worth saving,-1
So they give all their money to him,1
"Hes able to save forty people (uhh) on his rocket ship, which I found pretty interesting since he has thousands working for him to build his rocket ship and most of them know that hey, the only chance is for forty people getting out so why am I wasting all this time and energy to helping forty people get away when the astronomer, his daughter and her two boyfriends are already guaranteed four of the forty spots on the rocket ship",-1
(umm) The special effects arent all that good,-2
Hello expo,1
Im here to review Alien Versus Predator: Requiem,0
(uhh) I went to this movie and I was greatly disappointed but maybe I shouldnt have been at this point cause I shouldnt have expected much from it,-1
(uhh) The movie was a classic Alien Versus Predator,-2
"(uhh) Its pretty much the story of (uhh) a ship crashing, a predator ship crashing, from the (uhh) last one",-1
Crashes on earth in a small town and aliens get loose and start killing all the inhabitants,-3
(uhh) So a Predator has to come and save and hunt these aliens,-1
"(uhh) So I mean if thats what youre after, if youre all after is is (stutter) a Predator killing aliens then fine",-2
"The bad part is theres only one Predator, which kind of sucks",1
So you didnt get to see a bunch of different cool things like in the others,0
(umm) Definitely gets tireless after a while {laugh},0
"Dont expect much in in (stutter) acting or anything like that, its pretty much just classic Alien Versus Predators",-1
(umm) I would recommend waiting for a movie,-1
(uhh) I dont think you should go see this in theater or even pay matinee for this,-2
Just wait for a movie to come out and enjoy it then,-2
"Hello, today Im reviewing The Exorcism of Emily Rose (uhh) starring Laura Linney",0
(uhh) This movie is supposed to be based on a true story,1
"(umm) The previews for it looked really really really good, (umm) but it was not quite what I expected",-2
(umm) I expected something more along the lines of an The (stutter) Exorcist (umm) where it actually shows the story of the girl and the priest coming in and and performing the exorcism and going through it step by step like that and that just doesnt happen in this movie,1
(umm) This is actually told (uhh) from the point of view of a priest who (umm) performed the exorcism on Emily Rose,-2
And it starts at his trial,-2
Hes on trial for (umm) completing that exorcism and the only time you get to see Emily Rose is actually through flashbacks or through his storytelling,-1
(umm) The parts where you actually get to see her and what shes going through (umm) with demons possessing her are great,-1
"(umm) If the whole movie wouldve been like that this definitely wouldve been, you know, one of my top movies of all-time because the part where its focusing on her is well acted",-2
The girl in this movie did a really really good job,0
You do feel like shes being tormented (umm) but there just was not enough of it to support the movie,-1
"(umm) There are some haunting special features on this one (umm) some commentary, some deleted scenes (umm) and some other featurettes",0
(umm) If I had to rate this one I would say probably leave it alone,2
Its gonna get a one out of five from me,1
(umm) Just not enough of the actual exorcism (umm) to make it worth viewing,2
"Hi, Im Valerie and today Im going to be reviewing the movie Fred Claus",0
(umm) Its currently out in theaters and its about this guy named Fred and he is Santa Clauss brother,1
And its around the holiday times when everyones getting ready for Christmas and theyre getting all their toys set and (umm) so they have their little family get togethers and (umm) Fred doesnt really get along with anybody really,-1
He thinks the whole situation is silly,1
"So he kind of (uhh) steps in one day and looks after things at the North Pole and then it turns into this big party and everything goes kind of crazy havocy and so, Santa Clauss brother doesnt really like that too much and so I dont know",2
Its (uhh) its kind of a kid movie,0
I personally didnt really like it,0
I would rate it a two out of five,1
(umm) It seemed like he was just trying too hard I guess,-1
But if youre a really young kid you may find it entertaining and nice,-2
But (umm) not my type of Christmas movie,-2
"So, thats Fred Claus",-2
"(uhh) Go check it out, if you want",-1
"Hi Expo, this is Nikki",1
This is my review on the movie National Lampoons Christmas Vacation Two,0
(uhh) definitely not as good as the first,0
(umm) I think they were reaching for this one,-3
"(umm), I think since they had (umm) such a good one the first time",-3
"(umm), I think they thought that they could probably put another one together and (umm) my personal opinion, I think they failed miserably, but, you know, again,thats my opinion",-1
"(umm) I wouldnt recommend this to anybody, really",-1
(umm) I was just greatly disappointed,1
"Randy Quaid xxx yeah, {laugh} theres some funny things that he does, but he did those things in the first one",-3
(umm) its (uhh) not rated,-3
Eighty-three minutes long,-3
"(umm), it should be rated junk",-1
"(umm), so if (uhh) you really want to (umm) yeah, dont dont (stutter) waste your time, its its (stutter) really terrible",0
Hello and welcome to my review of the movie Twenty-Seven Dresses,1
(uhh) This movie (uhh) starring Katherine Heigl (uhh) most of you probably know her from (uhh) either Greys Anatomy (uhh) the ABC tv show,0
Or (uhh) (uhh) you may also know her from the movie Knocked Up,-2
(uhh) Knocked Up was a hilarious movie that I really enjoyed and (uhh) was expecting something along that lines for this movie,1
"(uhh) Its about (uhh) a girl whos kind of proverbially always a bridesmaid never the bride, (uhh) hence the name of the movie Twenty-Seven Dresses",3
(uhh) Shes been in twenty-seven different weddings and has twenty-seven hideous bridesmaid dresses to prove it,0
(umm) Its just kind of one of those predictable movies that (uhh) I dont think I would recommend going to see,-1
(uhh) I I (stutter) was pretty disappointed with with (stutter) it overall,-2
"(uhh) Its just you know, I had a few laughs and that sort of thing but nothing you know just, compared to Knocked Up which was just absolutely fall on the floor laughs I didnt think it was nearly as good",-2
"(uhh) You know Katherine Heigl does (uhh) a a (stutter) good job and she is kind of settling into a comedic role, (uhh) so she does a good job acting its no, not (stutter) a problem with the acting its more a problem with the story",-1
So overall I would not recommend seeing this movie I would give it two out of five stars,1

(umm) Theres the movie as you can see,0
Case,0
"But, (umm) what I wanted to say about this movie is that I am going to give it a one out of five stars just because if you have any morals what so ever, you wont watch this movie just because one, its very crude (umm) so much unnecessary stuff goes on, (umm) seems like theres always sexting or something inappropriate so I dont recommend it for kids and two, it promotes like saying like its okay to (umm) divorce and just you know garbage like that (umm) which you know theres so much divorce already and in, you know, United States, why do we need a movie saying its okay so basically what happens he meets this girl and they get married and they go on their honey moon and then he starts hanging out with another girl but Im not going to ruin it but, yeah",0
Hello Expo TV,0
Today I have for you a review of a movie currently in theaters the Bee Movie,0
"(uhh) In my opinion the Bee Movie is exactly that, a B movie",-2
B here standing for bad,1
"(umm) In some ways I look at this movie as (umm) an attempt, I dont know by either (stutter) the actors in the movie or the company who produced it to get back on its feet or something it didnt really",-2
"It was supposed to be a comedy, an animation and perhaps a kids movie and it was that",-2
It was a kids movie,-2
It wasnt very funny,-2
It wasnt very entertaining,-3
"(umm) It really didnt (uhh) add anything and give anything know to you know (umm) cinematography (stutter) (umm) Its basically just what the title says, a bad movie, a B movie (umm) and I really do think that",-2
I give it two out of five stars,-1
"(umm) Perhaps you know, (stutters) two out of five instead of one out of five because I did laugh sometimes",-1
(umm) It just didnt do it for me though,-2
It was it was all in all a bad movie,-2
I would not recommend it,-2

"Starring Parker Posey, Josh Hamilton, (umm) Tori Spelling, Freddie Prinz Junior",0

"(umm) Josh Hamilton plays the son, hes bringing his fiance to meet his family for the first time",1
"(umm) His his (stutter) mother tries to buy her off (uhh) but its his sister Parker Posey who is (umm) completely obscene, {laughs} or not obscene, insane and obsessed (umm) by her brother who probably most frightens us (uhh) in this movie",-1
"(uhh) The movie is billed as a dark comedy but (uhh) I didnt really find it all that funny, I found it kind of ridiculous and (uhh) maybe bizarre",-2
If if (stutter) thats a good word,-2
(uhh) I think the best line in the movie comes from Tori Spelling when she looks at Parker Posey and says no youre not insane youre just incredibly spoiled,2
(uhh) The House of Yes a rounding no,-2
"Hey, yall",1
"Its the king of movies here, and today Im going to review ten thousand BC, (uhh) which recently came out in theaters",0
Its (uhh) from the director of Independence Day and the Day After Tomorrow,-1
"And (uhh) while I found those films (uhh), particularly Independence Day, to be pretty good, (umm) (uhh) ten thousand BC fails in that department",-1
"(uhh) Its about basically a, a (stutter) tribe of people who, (uhh) you know, like someone who (uhh) one, one (stutter) person gets (uhh) like a princess kind of deal happens where (uhh) she gets kidnapped and basically the tribe goes out to rescue her and then they meet other tribes and a whole kind of war happens",-2
"(umm) I thought the ending especially was, (uhh) was pretty horrible",0
"(uhh) I dont want to ruin it, but (uhh) they, lets just say that they tried to surprise the audience all of the sudden with (uhh) a kind of (uhh) (uhh) just just (stutter) new (stutter) introduction of new characters, and I thought that was fairly week and disappointing",-2
"(umm) Its, (uhh) its been getting (uhh) pretty negative reviews by the press, but I tried to go into it with an open mind, (uhh) particularly because I liked Independence Day and (uhh) unfortunately it failed",-1
"The CGI, (uhh) there was a lot of CGI",-2
Some of its good,-2
Some of its kind of bad,-3
"(umm) There, it just wasnt my cup of tea",0
"Wasnt well executed, pretty formulaic, bad ending, wouldnt recommend watching it",0
"Hello, today Im going to review Semi-Pro starring Will Ferrell this is a movie thats basically a vehicle for more crazy Will Ferrell zany antics (uhh) hes playing a basketball player this time and thats basically all the plot there is to it",2
"It really has no plot, just an excuse for Will Ferrell to do crazy dumb things and (uhh) basically I think Will Ferrell might be out of schtick (uhh) all of his movies have been kind of dropping off into being repetitive and dumber and dumber and this one is probably the worst movie hes ever made",-2
"This has happened to a lot of the Saturday Night Live alum and (uhh) speaking of Saturday Night Live movies its just to give you an idea, I would say of all the bad movies that have ever come out of their characters this one would probably just barely beat Ladies Man",-2
"This is a really bad movie, it has no plot whatsoever and I really had high hopes for it because at his best Will Ferrell can be (uhh) apparently zany and funny, but spent a lot of money advertising (uhh) this movie, had multiple spots during the superbowl",-3
They even put the semi-pro character into the sports illustrated swimsuit edition,0
"You really couldnt get away from it and then you see the movie and really, really disappointing and it kind of think if it spent some money on writing instead of advertising it might have been a little bit better",-2
Hi,0
"Today Im reviewing the movie, The Happening",0
(umm) The Happening is the latest movie from writer director M,-2
"Night Shyamalan, who previously directed the good movies Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs",1
And the not so good movies The Village and Lady in the Water,-2
"(umm) Unfortunately, this one cant even fit into the not so good movies category (umm) Ill get to that in a little bit",-1
(umm) The movie stars Mark Wahlberg as a science teacher and Zooey Deschanel as his wife (umm) and also stars John Leguizamo as his friend,-2
"And something happens at the beginning of the movie and, for some reason, people start talking funny and killing themselves",-3
(umm) The cause of this is never fully explained,-3
(umm) There are theories that are thrown about and the big theory is pretty silly,-3
(umm) {clears throat} My problem with this movie isnt so much the plot,-3
(umm) It was probably a good idea when M,-1
"Night Shyamalan created it, when he thought of it, (umm) but unfortunately, most of the time, the actors actually find themselves walking or running, rather, away from the wind",0
They run away from the wind,1
"(umm) If that sounds exciting to you then maybe you can go check this movie out, but otherwise, dont bother",-2
(umm) The problem is also that the dialogue and the acting are atrocious,-2
(uhh) Thats probably the best word I can use to describe this movie is just atrocious,-3
"(umm) The Village and Lady in the Water were sub-par movies compared to the three movies that he made originally, but they were at least well made films (uhh) this Im surprised this movie actually got any kind of release, any kind of distribution",-2
The dialogue is horrible,-2
"(umm) Dialogues never really been his strong suit, but he usually casts decent enough actors or, at least, gets the best out of the actors that he casts to make up for it",0
"(uhh) With Bruce Willis or Mel Gibson, (umm) Paul Giamatti, (uhh) Bryce Dallas Howard, theyre all decent actors in his movies",-2
"(umm) I dont know if it was teaming up with Mark Wahlberg, who has is notori notoriously (stutter) wooden actor I dont know if that hurt the film, or not, but he also did not get anything out of John Leguizamo or Zooey Deschanel, who are usually pretty fine actors themselves",-3
"So, I dont know what exactly happened here, but the acting, it feels like the words are being read off of a script",-2
"As youre watching the movie it looks like theyre actually looking at cue cards and reading these words for the first time, thats how the delivery is",1
And it doesnt help that the words theyre delivering are just dumb,-3
"(umm) I almost walked out of the movie, but I wanted to stay till the end",-3
I wanted to see how it wrapped up,-1
"(umm) The beginning of the film where the construction workers start to kill themselves, its towards the very beginning of the film, (uhh) that was the first real sign of trouble, for me, was the acting by the lead construction worker",-3
"And, from there, it just went downhill and it went really over the top when (uhh) they were in some diner and a lady is looking at her iPhone, which is horrible product placement, and watching some ridiculous video about a guy in a tiger pit",-3
Obviously CG,-3
Bad CG,-3
Just terribly done,-2
Terribly delivered dialogue while theyre watching it,-3
Its just an awful movie,0
Im only gonna give this one one out of five stars,-1
I dont recommend anybody ever seeing this,-2
(uhh) This is the kind of movie thats gonna to be ridiculed in five years on DVD by drunken Frat boys because its just that awful,-2
"Hey everybody, this is Tom and today Im going to be reviewing the movie Hancock",0
"As always, bam, movie ticket, right there",2
Out of the way,-1
"Alright, Hancock",0
It is a Will Smith attempt at making a superhero movie in a summer of really good superhero movies,-2
"Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Dark Knight",0
"Okay, as you can tell Im doing this a little bit past the point when Hancock came out, but you see where Im going with this",-2
Hancock is not good,-2
"One, no one has ever heard of this, two, I hope nobody will remember this cause this was a bad movie",-1
"Okay, it had its funny points because its about a bum on the streets who has superhuman abilities",-2
And eventually he gets himself into trouble where he (stutter) he ends up saving a public relations guy and he tries to build up his image to get people to like him,-3
That is the story of this,-3
(umm) Okay the one thing that drove me nuts was the camera,0
Yes,-1
Half the time the camera was doing three-sixties,2
"So I think I kinda want to do the rest of this review doing nothing but three-sixties but that would drive you guys nuts, cause it drove me nuts",-2
"(uhh) Maybe I was the only one who noticed, who knows",-2
"(uhh) It it (stutter) was funny at times, but, you know, (stutter) it wasnt good enough for me",-2
(stutter) No,-1
"I I (stutter) didnt enjoy it, I I (stutter) just kind of sat there Hmm",1
Okay,-2
This was funny,0
"Why am I spending my money watching this? {sigh} I think I was more sad that I spent the money to watch this but (umm) otherwise it is funny enough to watch it, but not funny enough to watch it in theaters",1
"Wait to rent it if youre really desperate, buy it if you want to",-3
"(stutter) Dont know, its more up to you",-2
"Im going to give this a two out five, hope it helps",2
Hey all,1
Its the king of movies here and today Im going to review (uhh) The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,0
"Now (uhh) this is a new movie (uhh) starring (stutter) Brendan Fraser, Jet Li, and Maria Bello and its the third (uhh) movie in the, The Mummy series",-2
I believe the last one was actually in two-thousand-one or two-thousand-three,-1
"It was definitely over five years ago so (umm) this is kind of a surprise in a way to see a sequel so soon, perhaps its because (uhh) Indiana Jones four came out and people are kind of on that adventure wave right now",-1
"Theyre, (uhh) theyre enjoying their adventure kind of movie",1
"(umm) This movie as as (stutter) the other ones were is is (stutter) not to be taken too seriously, its pretty much popcorn entertainment",-1
"(uhh) Its just something that you watch, mindless fun (uhh) that you eventually, you know, just forget about pretty much immediately after watching it",1
"(umm) As as (stutter) popcorn entertainment it doesnt really (uhh) (uhh) fail necessarily, but it doesnt do its job as great as say even the first Mummy",0
"(uhh) The movie has Jet Li in it, which is a nice surprise, but I feel that if they (uhh) could have used him more in it (uhh) it would have been movie if they did",1
"(uhh) Theres some CGI in, CGI in (stutter) here that isnt very good and (uhh) usually there shouldnt be a problem but (uhh) it just detracts from the experience I think",1
(uhh) (stutter) It ends up being a little (uhh) a little disappointing,0
(uhh) Theres also just not that much (stutter) stuff in terms of originality,0
"Its a lot like the other Mummies, if youve seen those and you like them youll probably want to just see this cause youll like it too",1
If youre looking for even like a slight twist in the Mummy formula you probably wont wanna bother watching this because youre not going to be getting something like that,0
"So once again, if you, if you (stutter) enjoy just popcorn movies like even Journey to the Center of the Earth, if you like that (uhh) you might want to check this out",-1
"(umm) Unfortunately this one isnt in three D though, so its not as entertaining but (stutter) I think this is strictly for Mummy fans and people that just want (uhh) some kind of escapist movie to forget about their worries for ninety minutes",-1
And thats my review of The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,-2
"(uhh) In this movie they actually go to China and thats the whole dragon thing and thats why Jet Li is in it, in case you were wondering",-1
Hey expo Tv,1
Today I am going to talk about another summer movie that is currently in theaters,0
Vicky Cristina Barcelona,0
(umm) xxx seen this with a few of my friends and I was much more soft having done so (umm) this film has little substance,-3
Its a Woody Allen film strangely enough which you would think that it would have some substance but not this one (umm) with some big name actors Javier Bardem (umm) Scarlett Johansson and Penelope Cruz all on this film,-2
"And basically what it is, I will give you the basic plot Penelope Cruz, her character and Scarlett Johanssons character (umm) travel to Barcelona (umm) and there you know they are alone and they are young females",0
Basically there they just have (umm) relations with Javier Bardems character (umm) and hes still involved with with his wife so its kinda like a love quadrangle not a triangle cause theres three of them and one guy so quadrangle (umm) thats about as deep as the plot gets (umm) they try to do some cheesy plot development and cheesy character development,-1
It doesnt really work,-2
"Theres a little bit of humor in the film (umm) I think Woody Allen has an interesting sense of humor, a very dry sense of humor",1
"That I think worked with the film (umm) but originality wise, this movie is nothing that hasnt been made before Its just kinda sleezy (umm) waste of time completes your mind type of thing",-3
"Hey guys, Tina here and I want to do a review for you today of a movie that I just watched on DVD and the movie is called The Haunting, its The Haunting of Molly Hartley",1
"(uhh) This is a rated R movie on DVD, its just recently released on DVD and there arent any well known (uhh) actors in this movie, a lot of no names",-1
I honestly cant name one character for you that I knew in this movie,-1
Some of the faces looked familiar but (umm) not so much that I would be able to name them for you,0
Its basically (umm) based on the haunting of a high school student (uhh) whos haunted by her mother,-1
(umm) Apparently her mother tries to (uhh) kill her when shes younger and (umm) it really haunts her in terms of psychologically,-1
She has to see doctors and so forth,0
"I think its more of a a (stutter) teen flick more than anything because it revolves a lot of the, the (stutter) things are based in the high school where (uhh) Molly goes to school at",-1
"(umm) I watched it with my eleven year old daughter and she really enjoyed it, she likes scary movies, and it does have some scary points in it",2
"I didnt really care for it, all I could say its more of a a (stutter) teeny bop movie",-2

"Hello, Im Matthew and Im here to give you my review on this DVD movie called The Feeding",1
It came out in two thousand six and it was directed by Paul Moore,0
"Besides that I cant tell you the rest of the cast, it really has a bunch of nobodies in it",-3
(umm) The storyline is a bunch of college students go camping in the woods and there is a werewolf which is chasing them,-2
This is definitely an independent film,-1
How it got made I dont know,-1
This movie was quite possibly the worst movie Ive ever seen in my life,0
But almost to a point that was very funny,-3
It was shot on a very low budget,-2
It was shot really kind of grainy,-1
The acting was horrible in it,0
Almost like they were reading cue cards,1
The werewolf costume was completely unbelievable,-1
"And it also had a person in it who kept shooting the wrong, missing the werewolf when it shot at it and (stutter) shooting the college kids",-3
So she ended up killing about four of them because she was such a bad shot,1
"This movie, how it got made I dont know",0
"How it got released on DVD I dont know, but it was quite comical to watch and on a scale of one to ten I would probably give it a one",-1
"Hi, Im (uhh) reviewing the movie called (uhh) the Epic movie, which is currently in theaters and (umm) you know Ive seen commercials on TV and (uhh) its basically a type of movie like Scary Movie, like the series where they make spoofs of everything, and (uhh) Ive seen it on TV and (uhh) it looked (uhh) pretty funny from the (stutter) from the previews that I saw",1
"(umm) I saw that over the weekend, did did (stutter) good in the box office",0
I think it got something like over twenty million dollars,0
"So (umm) I decided to pay ten dollars, you know, go to the movie theater and see it and (uhh) gotta tell you that Im extremely disappointed in the movie",-3
"(umm) For more than half of the movie, I didnt even laugh",-1
"(umm) The only time I did laugh was at the the (stutter) pretty dirty stuff which they usually dont put in movies but, I mean that was pretty funny to me",1
"(umm) there are a couple of rap music scenes from from BET, that were trying to make fun of, wasnt really funny",-1
"Hey guys, (uhh) Im going to do a quick review on the movie called Epic Movie",1
"Its basically a movie (uhh) comedy satire (uhh) its it (stutter) mocks movies such as the (uhh) Da Vinci Code, Nacho Libre, X-Men, (umm) Land of Narnia, (uhh) Chocolate Factory, and some other movies I cant really think of right now",1
(uhh) it its (stutter) a movie that you dont really dont need brains to go watch it,-1
"Its a lot of toilet humor and cheap laughs, and if you are really really really desperate for that kind of a comedy, I highly recommend this movie for you",-2
"(umm) I mean if you are expecting (uhh) a lot more, I mean with this type of movie I dont think you will enjoy it",-2
"(uhh) Its, its (stutter) got a pretty, pretty (uhh) low rating (umm) right now, but its doing very well surprisingly, in the box office",-1
"So if youre really desperate for (uhh) I mean, cheap laughs and that sort of (uhh) genre movie I would highly recommend (uhh) this movie to you",0

Im here tonight because I just have something to get off my chest.,-1
If you guys ever followed the Machinima Youtube channel than you were probably aware of the show called All Your History Are Belong to Us.,-1
"You were probably aware of the controversy involving the new format of the show went through a few weeks back, mainly involving the new host Chris Lockey.",-2
"Well recently the show has been cancelled, and I think now its time to get something off my chest.",-2
"Its obviously too little, too late, but I just feel the need.",-1
I...personally feel that Chris Lockey was a great host.,1
"Flawed, yes, but he wouldve gotten better if we had given him a chance.",-1
"But, we never really did, and instead of leaving good, constructive criticism most of us just decided to leave complaints.",-2
"And now, because of that, Machinima got intimidated, and decided to shut down the show entirely: costing us a good quality series and Chris Lockey a job.",-1
"But seriously, it go- the hate got out of hand, people.",-2
"When Rob Talbert, the previous host, says it got out of hand it got out of hand.",-2

"But, where has this gotten us?",0
Those times are over.,-2
I am the only candidate for president who is both a lawyer and a psychologist.,1
"During these recent difficult times, a president with knowledge of the law and a strong allegiance to ethical and legal principals affecting our profession is necessary.",-1
I am that person.,1

"While taking my degree I have lived most of the time Nigeria, Africa.",1
I started while in the US.,2
"I barely took three courses before I had to go back home as my job demanded, and so every other course since then has been from Nigeria.",1
Part of what makes our program different is the faculty that we have teaching it.,1
"Theyre entrepreneurs themselves and so they know about the curriculum, and they know about putting it in action.",1
I remember takin a course on enterpreneurship and that seemed like the entire reason why I was here.,2

"And of course they, the (uhh) stories about an (stutter) anaconda and so you they find this giant anaconda that (umm) was in the movie and I couldnt even stand to look at it",-3
So (uhh) I didnt watch the whole show but if you are afraid of snakes or anything youd probably have your eyes closed the whole movie so I I (stutter) didnt like it,-2
Just looking at this cover with the snake on it I dont like it,-2

And it is the Venus razors.,2
This one in particular is the Venus Breeze razors.,0
And I really like these because its basically a two-in-one on the razor.,1
"So you still have the three blades, but then you have these little-- its like a gel soap bar on each end of the razor.",2
So you actually dont need to have a shaving cream or lather on your leg.,1
You can actually just shave straight with this.,1
"I like the Breeze ones a little bit better, because Ive noticed this doesnt tend to-- the jelly soap doesnt tend to melt as fast as some of the other brands.",2
"Or not the other brands, but the other types that Venus has out there.",1
And it lasts a little bit longer.,0
"- The financial aid process was a long, arduous one for me to learn about.",-2
There are tons of different financial aid; each college does it differently.,0
Sometimes you might have to learn about how one school does it and how another.,0
"Theres a lot of similarities a lot of times so they can transfer, but you always have to be specific with any college that you look into.",1
"What I learned is that some colleges give you a hundred percent, or a hundred percent of financial aid of tuition and board and that sort of thing.",1

"So he starts watching out his window, watching people for entertainment until he sees (uhh) something that basically (uhh) horrifies him",-2
He thinks his neighbor is actually a murderer but there is really nothing that he can do about it because he is under house arrest,-2
(uhh) If this plot sounds very familiar I think I saw this movie (uhh) many years ago,-2
"It actually came out about forty years and it was called A Rear Window and it starred Jimmy Stewart, and he was confined to his house because his leg was broken and in general I think that is a much better movie than the movie I have just seen in theaters",0
(uhh) I kind of felt a little bit cheated because (uhh) the plot is (uhh) very similar,-1
"You know, Jimmy Stewart relies on the people around him and his girlfriend to kind of investigate and figure out what was going on",0
Saw a lot of the same things happen in this movie and (uhh) this movie felt a little bit cheaper,1
They kind of tried to stylize it a little bit (uhh) for the younger audience but in general (uhh) I really didnt think it was worth the money,-2
"Save your seven bucks, go to the video store, rent A Rear Window, youre going to like that movie a lot much better",1
"I would rather buy that movie, (uhh) the Rear Window I mean, than to see this one again",-2
"If you do want to see this wait for it to come out on video and rent it, dont buy it",-1

"I also have an eye condition,  I would’ve thought that it might be a boundary to my education,  although there’s a wide range of support available,  which allows me to access lectures and slides which I can print out and take with me lectures,  as sometimes even with my contact lenses in, I struggle to see what’s actually written,  in the lectures.",1

This is a box set of the original three Star Wars movies,0
"A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi",0
"They are referenced countlessly in you know, modern culture, modern cinema",1
You see references you know Luke I am your father but with somebody elses name,1
And they are almost an American icon,2
"These are the movies that you know, were in the late seventies or early eighties before the yuppies existed before George Lucas had the money to and the technology to remove everything but the actors",1
"I I (stutter) mean in the original Star Wars, people actually acted it",0

"You know, to sort of fake a relationship to make those two jealous, Melissa Joan Hart gives him a makeover, and its all, it all (stutter) feels very like, its not, its not, (stutter) it doesnt have the sort of undercurrent of satire that a lot of high school comedies have, that sort of make them funny",-2
Chris Tucker is known for his off the wall slapstick comedic performances,0
"At the same time, Jackie Chan is known for his martial arts special effects action flicks",1

"(umm) {clears throat} The acting in this one is not really acting so much as one person fights and beats the crap out of others, (umm) the other star of the movie makes loud-mouth, (uhh) off-color remarks through the entire thing",-3
"(umm) Its supposed to be hilariously funny, its unfortunately not",-3

"(umm) Its all about puppets (umm) sort of the like parody of the old seventies puppet television shows, (umm) but it is not that good it (uhh) it tries to be kind of (uhh) sexy and (uhh) taken into account like political themes like Kim Jong Eun (umm) is the bad guy and (uhh) theres a bunch of like (uhh) celebrities in it who would team up with him because they are like super liberal celebrities",-1
The plots kind of (stutter) but I mean puppets so what do you want,-1
Hey,1
Today Im going to be reviewing the two disc special edition of The Hulk widescreen,0
This (uhh) is a pretty ridiculous movie,-2
"It covers the story of the Hulk, a man who is (uhh) a scientist exposed to gamma radiation and then ever since that exposure when he becomes angry he turns into the Hulk, a huge green (uhh) monster man with (uhh) unlimited power and invulnerability, and with the added feature that the angrier the Hulk gets the more powerful and more invulnerable he becomes",-1
"So basically its a, its a story, this is a story about a man who who (stutter) suffers because he cant control his anger, but also uses this anger to lash out at society and his oppressors",-1
The movie kind of glosses over a lot of the (uhh) (stutter) a lot of the things that you could say with a story like that in favor of just pure action,-2
"The Hulk smashing tanks and smashing helicopters and jumping thousands of miles, and while thats entertaining its I also dont think thats enough",-2
"I think you could have done a little bit more with this movie, with the subject matter",0
"But portraying him as a tortured soul a little bit better, I dont know",0
"But as it is, its a, its a (stutter) fairly entertaining movie but very, very brainless",-1
"(uhh) The special effects are nice, but not enough to warrant any kind of purchase or rental",0
I kind of wish I didnt have this,-1
I give it a two,-2
"Its, its not as bad as, as (stutter) a one but like I said theres very, very little here to reclaim it and make it valuable",-1

"The company, which is focused in Mexico, has the producing Rosario project, two advanced-stage projects, the San Filipe and Gavilanes, and an early-stage exploration project, El Gachi.",2
"Drilling on the Transversales vein, at its San Felipe Project in Sonora State, confirmed the continuity of a new vein both along strike and to depth.",0
"Additionally, 3 parallel veins have been identified at surface in the footwall over the currently defined strike length of the main Transversales vein, but have not been drill tested.",1
These veins average 5 metres in width each.,1
"(map in release) Of the 11 drill holes reported, hole SCVT-02 reported 11.8 metres of 116 grams per tonne silver equivalent.",1
"The weighted average intercept of the reported assays is 2.6 metres of 199 grams per tonne silver equivalent, with 69 grams per tonne silver, 2.7% zinc, 0.17% copper, 0.99% lead, which is slightly lower than the current resource grade at San Felipe.",1
Drilling has traced the strike at transversales to 200 metres and a depth of 240 metres and it remains open along strike and at depth.,1
"Arturo Préstamo Elizondo, President and CEO stated, The confirmation that the surface outcroppings of the Transversales vein appear well mineralized along strike and to depth indicate a highly mineralized system.",1
"This, together with parallel-mineralized systems and an untested structural corridor of at least one kilometer significantly increases the potential of the San Felipe Project. Jennings Capital stated, We like the broader exploration potential of San Felipe, in particular the Las Lamas vein that only accounts for 5% of the approximately 50 million ounces silver equivalent resource and has averaged silver grades above 140 grams per tonne during this round of drilling. According to management, Rosario continues to ramp up tonnage as additional faces and stopes are opened.",1
Management expects throughput to achieve 300 tonnes per day by the end of the year as both main veins contribute to production.,1

"So Handmade opens on Saturday  and closes on Tuesday, but Home, Gift and New  all open on Sunday and close on Wednesday.",1

"My name is Anthony Maddaloni, and Im going to be talking about how to start a photography business.",1
"Now one thing about starting a photography business is that you want to really, seriously consider what youre doing.",-1
Most people start out in photography as a hobby or something they really enjoy.,1
"Now this is sort of, I dont know, being a little, you know, you really want to look at it.",0
"Do I want to start doing something I really enjoy as a pass time and start it in to a business, because you might not really enjoy doing it so much anymore where it becomes a business.",1
"But, on the other hand, you might actually enjoy doing it more because youre getting paid to do something you enjoy.",1
"I mean, Im trying to kind of make it a little bit comical, but to be really honest with you, it really gets to be that way sometimes for some photographers.",-1
"Where as they started out doing something they love and ended up actually hating it and just doing it for money, and in the end, I think sometimes that really shows.",-1
"So its really something you want to think about, even before you begin doing anything.",0
"One thing about a photography business is that photography is extremely expensive, so your start up fees are going to be very high.",-1
"Being honest, the only reason Im dressed like this today is because I didnt do laundry this week So Im gonna have to be formal for a couple days now So its election season here in America and if you didnt know that then congrats on your first time... ever using a computer?",-2

And yeah, I guess Im all down for like, getting along with other human beings despite your disagreements Because youre gonna have to learn to do that to some extent to get by in this world without wanting to murder everyone.",-2

"And after my sophomore year I transferred to a different school, and I didn’t change anything about myself",0
"I just showed up at the new school, and all of a sudden I was really popular, and I had boyfriends and I went to dances and I was on the prom committee and I wrote for the paper",2
It was a whole different life because nobody knew I was supposed to be a loser,0
"So, I experienced high school, if you think of it as a hierarchy, right, from the top of the hierarchy and from the bottom",1
And I don’t think that very many people get that chance,0
"So, I think that has really helped me in being able to write characters with, you know, a variety of high school experiences",3
"And high school is a fascinating setting, especially boarding school or summer camp where you really are stuck there",2
"I think when you have a place like high school where you’re legally obligated to show up every day, you cannot walk away",0
A lot of human drama happens that would not happen in a grownup life where there’s no legal obligation to show up anywhere,2

We did sort of push-pull kind of strategy,0
"When we initially launched the system we decided that we were going to our BIS team and find all of our users that have already been logged on customers to our Internet site, and take those user names and push them into the Widen system and then market to those specific users, letting them know what kind of new system we were creating, what were the advantages of it, and push that out to them",0
"We did a full back cover spread on our very first catalog when we launched the marketing toolbox, identifying what it was, how easy it was to use, and we came up with a quick little slogan to use to try to get them to understand that it was fast, easy and simple, which was basically our slogan that we used",1
"And we highlighted it on that catalog that gets distributed out to about 10,000 addresses, which is a very large audience, to see how many would actually log on to our website, and come in and see the toolbox",1
We gave that roughly about a couple months to see how that settled in,0
Then we followed up with an email blast to identify that this new system was here and what were the advantages of using the system,0
Then we followed up with a survey,0
"We particularly were talking about our catalogs, and our sourcebooks and our marketing materials, but we felt that that was the perfect opportunity to then ask if they had seen the marketing toolbox advertised on the back of our catalog or advertised through our email blast, which gave us some insight as to how many people were really knowledged about it and what step we needed to take to implement further from there and whether we could move into a training position or whether we needed to continue on with our marketing efforts",2
"From that we felt like there was a good enough number of customers who had seen it in the few places that we had put it out, and we moved into our training phase, which was launching WebExes a couple times a week for a few consecutive weeks in a row, and putting out open lines to all of our customers saying that they could attend a particular WebEx",2

Hi my name is Zach Parry,0
"Today I am going to be answering the question, Is it legal to surf the deep web? To answer that questions lets first get an understand what deep web is",0
"Because, when you get on Google on run a research and youre looking for information youre actually surfing the shallow web, if you will",0
"Index meaning, Google has it in their algorithm and it could be a potential search result",0
The deep web is the unindexed portion of the internet,1
Its all that information that people put online that doesnt run through Google or that Google or other search engines cannot see,-1
"In fact, the vast majority of information online is in the deep web",1
And a lot of it is pretty benign,1
Just because the information is uncharted or unmapped downt mean there is anything illegal about it,0
"For example, if you were to get on the Clark County recorders website and you want to search recorded documents associated with a certain parcel number, or were you to get on a Clark County assessors site or the Clark County District Court website and you wanted to search different cases, none of that is indexed",-1
"In order to find that, you cant go through Google, you have to go through the portal on respective web sites",1
So all that public information is unindexed and therefore as part of the deep web,1
"Yet, theres nothing wrong with searching for that information",0
"So, the question really is, what is it that youre looking for on the deep web, because certainly there are illegal activities going on beneath the radar of what is indexed",0
"So, yes it is legal to surf the web",2
"In and of itself, searching this information, and looking at information that is not indexed is not illegal",1
There is nothing wrong with that,1
"The question is, what is it that youre doing because some of the activities on there, if you were looking for a contract killer, for example, that would be illegal",1
So the answer depends on what the actual behavior is,0
But surfing the deep web in and of itself is perfectly legal,0

They can provide you great support with related cross promotions and help you develop a strong working relationship with your media partner.,1
"What media partners generally want from you is to own the event, taking sponsorship credit for it in the community with no cash investment and to secure exclusive rights to be on site in exchange for promotion on air or in kind advertising at no cost to you.",1
Media partnerships are an excellent way to do more with less and you always have less than youd like.,0
Consider working with related businesses so that both benefit from the team work.,1
"For instance, if your event is a concert, tickets and t-shirts become currency.",1
Give them out a couple of days before the event to create a little buzz.,1

Whats up i wanted to do a video on the new teaser trailer that Activision released for what one can assume is the new Guitar Hero game.,0
The trailer is just in the background right now.,0
Its about a 15-20 second trailer.,-1
And you know it shows a band getting ready to go on stage.,-1
There was some interesting things i noticed about the trailer.,0
Like the first thing youll see is that there is a guy holding a guitar pick.,1
And weve heard rumours in the past that the new guitar hero would be much more realistic in its approach to the series.,1
Maybe it could be something similar with what weve seen with Rocksmith with allowing people to play real guitars.,0
We do see guitars in the trailer.,1
We also see a drum kit in the trailer too and towards the very end.,1
"Hi, Im Rebecca Lee, Advisor at the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.",2

"Im a professor here at Stanford and for the past eight years, Ive been teaching the class The Design and Analysis of Algorithms. And Im pleased to say that for the first time were going to be offering this class online, freely available to everybody.",1
"So here at Stanford, the design and analysis of algorithms is the corner stone of the computer sciences curriculum.",1
How come?,1
"Well, the ideas that you learn in this class are critical for literally every other branch of computer science and not only that also increasingly in the natural sciences in particular in computational biology and even in the social sciences, for example, in economics.",2
"On a more just purely pragmatic level, I have to say that every year when I teach this class several students come up to me afterwards and tell me it was the key class that got them to ace all of the questions in their mechanical interviews.",1
"So, what do you learn in this class?",1
"Well, well start out by talking about the divide and conquer algorithm design paradigm, in particular with applications to fast searching, sorting and multiplication.",2
"Second, well talk about several blazing fast algorithms for manipulating and reasoning about graphs.",1
Such as computing connectivity information and also shortest paths.,0
"Finally, well discuss randomized algorithms.",-1
So continuing with the bankruptcy theme I wanted to talk about some other brands that have filed for bankruptcy in the last few years,-1
"One very notable one is American Apparel, especially since theyve filed bankruptcy twice within the period of a little bit over a year",-1
Thats kind of crazy,1
"Other brands include Pacific Sunwear, Cache, Wet Seal, and Quicksilver",0
And if you kind of listen to the names of these brands you might figure out that theres a pattern,2
A lot of these are very teen specific or sort of focus on a younger customer,1
I think theres sort of three big reasons why these types of companies are having trouble,0
Number one is that trends are moving a lot quicker than they used to when I was a teenager,1
Theyre not as stagnant and theres been a huge acceleration over the past ten years of teen trends,1
The second thing is that teen trends used to be a much more segregated niche,-2
But theyre much more influenced now by the designer runways because of internet easy access to viewing collections online,-1
"Teen trends used to be very isolated from runway trends but now with the rise of the internet and also access to cheap runway copies, any potential business for these outdated teen retailers has sort of been absorbed by companies like H&amp;M, Zara, Forever 21, and other online niche brands",0
The third thing is that social media celebrates diversity,0
"When I was a teenager there wasnt social media and it was much more common to just want to fit in, to look like your peers, to dress like your peers",1
But today if you want to stand out online you have to be different and how many Instagram followers you have sort of overrides what your peers think of you,-1
"So if you are the kid in school that has the most followers out of that anyone else, then you probably are the cool kid in school because you have the biggest following you have the biggest influence",-1
"And I think that you know its sort of like just like the the value of sort of businesses, bloggers, and brands are sort of partly based off of the influence they have and how many followers they have teenagers acceptance among peers is also sort of based off of your influence your online influence",2
And these troubled brands they just really didnt utilize this at least not fast enough,1
Okay we have talked about the person and the family in this birthday speech.,1

VENKAT: I got interested in entrepreneurship and teaching entrepreneurship because of my experience that I had early in my career.,1
"Some of the most exciting times Ive had were those two years when I worked for a spin-off of a large company, where we decided to start a new business.",2
And we spent two years creating something out of basically nothing.,1
It was chaos.,2
It was exciting.,1
We didnt know what the next day would bring.,2
"But all of those experiences that an entrepreneur goes through, the ups and downs, the late evenings and early mornings, I experienced all of that in that two-year time frame.",2
"Hello, so today Im going to speak to you about this product.",2
"We keep each other safe, you know what Im saying",0
"But we cant because we -- you know, the system wants to divide and conquer so they find a way to do that",-1
"Once people start caring, even if it doesnt involve them, then they will learn to have that empathy and sympathy for others and then we can learn to protect each other because we would know what that type of pain would feel like",1
"Were all equals in this, you know what Im saying",-2
"Its us against them, its not us, us, us, them, them, them, and the big man -- no",-2
"For far too long, the greatest predictor of how well you will do at school has been your parents income.",-1
Now thats simply not good enough.,0
"Every child deserves a chance, they deserve a chance to be the best that they can be and thats why the Government is introducing a pupil premium.",-1
Its been in place in schools now for just over six months and today Im announcing that the amount of money available will go up significantly.,1
"Not only is it  increasing to £600 per pupil but also taking in many more students, reaching many more disadvantaged students who deserve that extra chance.",1
An extra half a million students will be taken into the pupil premium.,2
The pupil premium is already making a big difference in schools.,1
"Schools are using it to pay for one-to-one tuition, extra catch-up classes,  parent support advisors, all the things we know make a difference for children who are falling behind.",-1
Its simply not good enough that how well you should do at school is so dependent on your parents background.,1
"Peter puts it out there in very plain language, and after you follow what he is doing there and you watch the stocks that he has provided over time you get a certain level of confidence ok, that Peter does know what he is doing!",2

"They wouldnt be able to run his business, but that is Donald Trumps plan right now",-2
Making him in direct violation of this law if it were to ever pass,-2
That is why Republicans wont let it go forward,-2
"There are four exchanges used in the  counting method, and these exchanges  are similar, as I was saying earlier, to  borrowing in print.",1
The exchanges for  addition and multiplication are the  same and the exchanges for subtraction  and division are the same.,0
"These  exchanges for subtraction and division  can be thought of as opposite of  addition and multiplication, if that’s  helpful.",0
If possible the exchanges of  the beads needs to occur in one movement as you count and move  the beads toward or away from the  horizontal counting bar.,0
The other  thing to remember about the exchanges  is that they can occur in any column  anywhere on the abacus.,0
So the four  five exchange just doesn’t happen  in the units column.,1

"Its like the shape of my head is flawed somehow, but it makes me unique",-1
"But there are some flaws that we dont really want to have in our lives, theyre like the flaws of the way we think",1
"Maybe personality traits that you know dont come out right in public when they should, or something",1
"So, I want to encourage you today, when someone youre dealing with has a flaw thats very obvious, most likely theyre working on it, or theyre aware of it",-1
So try to see past the flaw,1
"Dont get all bent out of shape because this thing is eating away at you, the way it presses your buttons or something",2

Here are a few thoughts on dealing with late paying clients.,-1
Im John Harrington.,-2
Dealing with late paying clients is the bane of every photographers existence.,1
"Heck, Im sure its the bane of most businesses existence, especially those that deal with people who provide services and then pay at a later date.",1
In the end ultimately you do need to get paid and the first thing you need to do is if that particular person youre dealing with is not in the accounting department reach out to the accounting department in that company.,1

"In fact, having RAM on your computer is only  part of the equation.",0
"Once the RAM is there, the programmers need to write  the program to take advantage of the extra RAM.",-1
This is the big reason why thirty-two bit versus sixty-four bit is such a big deal.,1
Programs were written originally with a thirty-two-bit limitation.,-1
"That is to say that the most RAM they could access was four gigabytes, thats what that thirty-two bit refers to, is how much RAM a program has access to.",1
"By opening up the RAM from thirty-two bits to  sixty-four bits, the RAM goes from four gigabytes into the petabyte range, I mean its just vast beyond words to describe, which means probably by next week well figure out a way to fill it up     but the fact is, Final Cut needs to have its software actually recoded, rewritten to be able to support   the additional RAM that youve got.",-2
So the reason youre getting an out of memory is that youre filling that four gigabyte limit.,0
"Now its even smaller than that because one point five gigabytes of that four gigabyte RAM is tied up with what are called frameworks, stuff the application needs to be able to function, and only two point five gigabytes is available for your data.",-1
"The out of memory flag exists because your Browser is so full of stuff, either clips or sequences, and probably sequences, that is filling that two point five gigabyte limit to the point where Final Cut cant function.",1
The way you solve this problem is to get rid of clips in the Browser and get rid of sequences in the Browser that you no longer  need.,0
"The most commonly asked questions by AdWords advertisers is why arent my ads showing? Its a legitimate concern, but there is an equally legitimate response coming from Google.",-1
There are three distinct reasons why you may not be seeing your ads.,-1
The first is your previous search history.,-1
"The second is a budgetary and billing concern, and the third is your actual selection of delivery methods.",1
Budgetary and billing concerns are often the most overlooked reasons as to why your ads are not delivering.,1
"In AdWords, daily and monthly budgets are set to reflect what you would like to see from your campaign spend.",2
If your daily or monthly budget has been depleted your ads will no longer show as its simply a factor of the click costs you can accrue within your budget.,0
Make sure to check your billing tab if your ads arent showing.,0
"Its possible that there is an issue with the method of payment, an outstanding balance, or something thats causing the credit card to not process.",0
This is a definite reason why your ads will not be showing.,-1
If your billing cannot be processed Google cannot show your ads.,0
Your previous search history can effect your delivery profoundly.,0

My name is Victor Macias.,2
"I am the co-founder of Malestandard.com, and today I am excited because I have another product to review for you guys.",2
"This time, the good folks over at Axe have asked us to review their new Apollo line.",2
So I have the shampoo and conditioner here and I have the new deodorant here.,1
"So in Male Standard fashion, the first thing we did was we looked at the shampoo and conditioner and we examined the scent.",1
Now what I have here is the Fresh scent.,1
"And if youve seen reviews in the past or read the reviews on our website, youll see that we are big fans of subtle scents when it comes to shampoos and conditioners or body washes.",1
Now the main reason is because a lot of us like to wear cologne at night.,1
"So if you have a really overpowering scent, it will clash and just create something thats really not what we wanted.",1
"So what we liked is it definitely has that fresh, light scent.",3
"It almost has like a spearmint type of scent to it, and after using it, you could subtly smell it, but it wasnt overpowering.",1
And it cleans very well.,1
It definitely created a good lather and left my hair feeling really good and really clean.,2
Next up is the Axe 24 hour deodorant.,2
Now this is the same scent.,2
"Its the Fresh, but it is noticeably stronger.",3
"Now thats not necessarily bad, especially if youre a fan of the scents of Axe and you plan to wear a body scent after.",1
This could be your primary scent to wear after you go to the gym or something.,1
"It definitely, it worked.",1
"Im not an overly sweaty person, but I did feel dry, and when I wore this product I did not wear any other fragrances with it.",2
And I got a lot of good compliments actually from it.,2
"One definitely from my girlfriend, and its not just because shes my girlfriend because I have tried other products and have not had favorable results sometimes.",2
So this is definitely something good.,1
But what really excited me was the campaign that they told us about.,1
"Now if you go to Wal-Mart and you purchase a package of specially marked Apollo Axe, youll find a code.",1
"With that code, youll be able to go to a special website and the link is going to be at the bottom of this YouTube video, and itll also be on malestandard.com, and you enter the code.",1
"If you select a winning package, you could win a trip to space.",2
"I mean, how many of you have seen those commercials from Axe where its showing the astronaut and the girls going all crazy for the astronaut?",2
"That could be you if you enter the code, if you purchase the right product.",2
"So overall, for an Axe product, we definitely dug it.",1
"Weve tried different Axe products and Id say this is our favorite so far, especially the scent.",2
The Fresh scent is really good.,2
And the opportunity to go into space is awesome.,1
So we will be posting this video on Malestandard.com with a more in-depth written review and the link to sign up for the Apollo space camp.,1
To enter for the chance to win is at the bottom of this video and will be on our website.,1

"SECRETARY KERRY: But the dominant truth about the situation in Syria is that, although Assad and Daesh are supposed to be bitter opponents, they are both parts of the same problem.",1
"In fact, the rise of Daesh is directly attributable to the policies and actions of the Assad regime, and that is why we have referred to Assad as a magnet for terrorism.",-1
"This is a case, and there are many in history, in which two supposed enemies are in fact symbolic.",2
Loathing towards Assad drove thousands of Syrians into the arms of Daesh.,2
And fear of Daesh caused some Syrian groups to feel that they had no realistic option but to support the government.,0
"That’s not just symbolic; that’s a symbiotic relationship, each piece dependent on the other.",-1
And the desire to flee both explains the massive refugee crisis that we face today.,-1
The relationship between Assad and Daesh clarifies one of the apparent peculiarities of this conflict – that the two extremes have only rarely targeted one another.,1
Think about that.,-1

And we do want all financial aid forms to be submitted at the same time that the admission application is submitted.,0
"We will consider then, just like we do for domestic students , an international student’s parents income and assets and then make a determination of what that family contribution will be over four years.",1
"This is different, a little bit different for international students in that we do set that family contribution for four years and it is not adjusted and an international student would not need to reapply for financial aid once they have had a family contribution set for them.",1
"In the financial aid that we award, we would be awarding a combination of loans and work study and grants or scholarships.",1

"Ruben Burga: The students benefit from the interaction with the professors, and this interaction is in the hallway, it is not necessarily a formal interaction, but as you meet up with the professors you start getting a sense of what I should do in my case because they share ideas, or I share my ideas and they give me feedback",1
So the culture is very supportive,1
The culture is very dynamic,1
"People are interested when you actually publish something, or when you present something, and its always questioning the big why are you doing this",1

My niche is really in organizational leadership but I work at the intersection of a couple of spheres,1

Before we started working with CENTORRINO Technologies we had a local firm that worked with us,0
Same gentleman most of the time came,0
It was a little limiting,1
He didnt have a knowledge of how the CEO worked and what the requirements were,1
And so we just found that he just couldnt service us the way we needed to,1
"We found out about CENTORRINO Technologies through a couple of other schools, one in Torquay who were using CENTORRINO Technologies at the time and another one up in the western area",2
They were using CENTORRINO as well and had good reports back about those so we thought wed have a chat,0
What CENTORRINO Technologies have done for us is really been able to give us surety in how our system works,1
Before CENTORRINO Technologies I had to go down to the server every night before I left and throw another tape into back it up and take these with me and it was often you would forget those sort of things,0
It was always a constant worry that it wasnt actually working,1
And now everything is backed up offsite by CENTORRINO Technologies and we dont have to worry about it and I know that it is there because we have had to retrieve it before,1
So what we get with CENTORRINO Technologies is an overall package,1
"We pay a fixed fee and we get unlimited support - thats phone support, people coming down to work on our system or email support",-1
It means that we can look to the future as well and bring on new systems or new products and they are going to be able to service those,1
We added some iPads earlier this year and they are going to be managing those for us into the future,0
It just means that we can bring our technology forward without having to worry about knowing how to manage it,1
Weve got Mac and PCs here,1
We are leaning towards more of a Mac school and thats been something that has been a real bonus for us,1
Having someone from CENTORRINO Technologies who understands Macs,2
We had a lot of trouble in the beginning to get that to happen but now that weve got someone who comes down here regularly to work on those,1
It just meant they are a lot easier to run,2
For teachers and students it really again means that they can most of the time be sure if our network is up because everything is working properly - that they can just run their day,1
"Teachers can just come to school, know that if they want to run a YouTube clip for the children first thing in the morning, that it is going to work",-1
That if they want to connect up to their interactive whiteboard that they know that its going to work,-1
The children when they are sent off to use the iPads or the computers know that they are going to work,1
And thats what makes teaching so much easier,0
"And from my perspective as an administrator, Im also the IT person here it means that I am not running around trying to fix things, because they just work",2
"Yes, I will recommend CENTORRINO Technologies and have in the past recommended them",0
I believe that they have the ability to know what the needs of our schools are,1

"So I work with a lot of clients as a professional organizer and the one common denominator between all of my clients are these little stacks of business cards just like everywhere in the house, in the kitchen, the entrance way, the bathroom, the office, the toy room.",3
Like why are there business cards in the toy room?,1
"Your kids dont want to play with Joe Smith, the plumbers business card.",1
"They want to play with Mr. Potato Head, LEGOs and dress-up.",1
"So its time to gather all those cards that dont belong in the places where theyre currently at and put them in a system that is going to be easy to put away, easy to find, and easy to grab when its time to look for that card to contact that person that youve been meaning to contact for months.",1
So Im going to show you what I do.,2
"Since Im a business owner, I go to a lot of networking events and I go to a lot of workshops and Im constantly meeting new people and exchanging business cards.",2
"And when I do that and I get a new card, I come home, I empty my purse and I put my cards into this jar that I got from the craft store.",2
"Hi, Im Keeley Selvage with Keeleys Skin Solutions.",2
"Ive been a clinical aesthetician for over half a decade, and Im going to talk to you about whether or not hemorrhoidal cream can help wrinkles.",1
"Hemorrhoidal cream, you know you have some in your closet.",1
The reason it works so well is because most have steroids in them.,-2
What steroids do is theyre a natural anti-inflammatory and they actually also thin the skin.,-1

"Hey guys, this is David over at A Secure Life",0
Today were doing a review of Frontpoint Home Security Systems,1
Frontpoint is actually been our #1 pick for 9 years running,0
And this is primarily due to their incredibly high levels of customer service and the way that they handle their sales process - its a lot lower pressure than some of the other companies out there,2
Were going to do a deep dive and go into what really sets Frontpoint apart from its competitors and what youre going to get if you do decide to go with Frontpoint,2
Frontpoint Security Systems are both 100% wireless -meaning that the sensors in your home all wirelessly communicate to your control panel - as well as 100% cellular monitoring - which means that a burglar cant cut your phone line and bypass the security system,-1
If youre in a very rural area you may or may not be able to get monitoring service where you live so just make sure to call and check with Frontpoint,1
"Unlike some other companies, Frontpoint has done a really great job of being transparent with their pricing and their fees",1
You can see all of them on their website,1
They also offer a 30-day money-back guarantee which will allow you to test out the sensors and the system in your home,1
"They are not the cheapest option on the market when it comes to monitoring, but we feel that they have a really great overall value",1
"So if youre okay with paying just a tiny bit more, but getting great customer service and a great customer experience, we think youll really like them",1
"So weve talked about it throughout the entire review, but honestly what sets Frontpoint apart is customer service",0
So weve actually done quite a few phone calls that were mystery shopping Frontpoint - making sure that we understood how they treat their customers when it comes to tough issues or complaints or sales,1
"And we were really impressed by how much time they were willing to take, by how patient they were and how little pressure there was during the sales process",-1
It was focused around answering questions instead of trying to up-sell us home automation or an extra camera,2
"Frontpoint uses a combination of cutting edge technology, equipment and customer service all at a great price",1
"Its a really hard combination to beat, and for the last 9 years, nobody has",1
