"Hi, this is my review of this movie, Six Days and Seven Nights",0
"Which is a nineties Harrison Ford, semi-action, more romantic comedy flick",-1
Despite how serious he look here on the cover there's not a lot of action going on,-1
It's him and Anne Heche,0
She's the love interest,0
"(umm) pretty funny but all in all, not not worth the price of admission",-2
This is the DVD widescreen edition so you can actually enjoy the full aspect,-2
It was actually some good scenery in this,-1
Some good stuff to watch,-1
"But (umm) Harrison Ford plays his (stutter) normal character, a gruff cargo pilot",0

"(umm) The little boys liked it, the little girls fell asleep",1
"I couldn't wait til it was over, but you know if you have little boys then, you know, they probably would like this movie",-2
"(umm) It might be one to wait though, and not go to the movie (uhh) theater and see, but I would wait for it to come out on video and then maybe rent the video",-2
I don't think it would be worth taking the whole family to the movies to see it,-2
"(umm) I don't know, it was just kind of boring",-2
Maybe it's just because I don't have little boys so I'm not really into the little (uhh) characters like that,-2

"And that's being really generous, because I know that the I know that the (stutter) Halloween Adventure was made after I was born, and I was born in eighty two",-1
But still,1
Regardless (umm) all three specials are just awesome,0

(umm) It it (stutter) was so confusing about what was happening,0
Half the movie was not fighting was you know backstabbing and underhand dealings and you never know who was on who's team and what was going on,-3
"Really not I think in order to see this movie, you would have to watch the first two right beforehand to understand it properly because, coming out of that theater after two and a half hours, I still had on idea what was going on",-1
(umm) I don't know what the movie directors were thinking I guess they decided that by throwing as much fancy computer graphics as they could they would cover up the fact that there was absolutely no plot,-2
"(umm) Really, (uhh) unless you're a die hard fan, I would not recommend this one",-2
You're really not missing out on anything,-2
"(umm) And in fact, you know a lot of the character development was kinda (uhh) was a little bit angering such as (umm) you know Keira Knightley's development",-1
I am not going to give away the plot if you do want to see it but (umm) but I was very disappointed,-2

(umm) This movie was excellent,0
(uhh) I would recommend it to anyone,3
I think that (uhh) it would appeal to all age groups,2
(umm) In fact I think that the movie was perhaps geared toward a more mature audience,1
(umm) A lot of the humor felt more mature than than (stutter) in previous Pixar movies,0
(umm) But I still think that kids would enjoy it equally as well,1
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix yes Harry Potter's back and I think he's forty seven in this one no no he's not that old but (stutter) he's starting to look old in the movies they're all starting to look all grown up, and (umm) I'll admit it that I'm I'm (stutter) a dork and I enjoy the Harry Potter movies not saying everybody that enjoys Harry Potter movie is necessarily a dork, but (umm) I'm an older gentleman and I enjoy the kid movies but (umm) it's a very good movie (stutter) I mean the the the (stutter) movies in general are very good they the first one was really good the second one was still pretty good, and they just went on downhill from down there, this one wasn't very good I mean I didn't think it was that good (umm) Harry's back in school yet again and I think this is his fifth year, and (umm) this time new people are taking over Hogwart the school, see I told you I'm a dork I know the names of the school, and (umm) they're trying to discredit Harry saying that Lord the the (stutter) bad guys coming back I don't know his name Valdemort, Valdemont (stutter) I know it begins with a V I know that much but they're trying to discredit him and (umm) to me it just seems I don't know maybe i'm growing up whenever the first one came out I was a little younger than I am now but (umm) I didn't enjoy this one and I'm sure kids will enjoy it, I I (stutter) mean there was a lot of magic and the acting in it was really good, and (umm) the scenes were really good the (umm) the magic scenes looked awesome, but (umm) I just didn't enjoy it",1
Hi today I'm gonna review this DVD Ten Items or Less,-1
This is a short documentary film that stars Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega,1
(umm) It was really very strange movie (umm) I guess it's from the documentary style,-2
"It deals with (uhh) the Latino community and this underprivileged girl who works at a grocery store and Morgan Freeman is this older, out of work movie star who sort of takes up to her and (umm) tries to help her and build her self esteem",-1
The character {cough} the characters (umm) you really learn to enjoy their (umm) their bond that they build between each other,-1
"But as far as the movie (umm) it was just not a (umm) very exciting movie, I couldn't really figure out the plot to the story",2
I mean it had a plot but it was sort of like what's the point,-3
(umm) They did a good job with the acting but the storyline just didn't hold up as far as I was concerned it was just too much just normal everyday life,-2
(umm) {cough} This particular one is rated R and it's only eighty-two minutes long,-2
"It's English with (uhh) Spanish subtitles, and (umm) I probably wouldn't really recommend it I mean if you have it it's fun to watch but I probably wouldn't recommend buying it",-1
I'd probably give it two and a half stars and (umm) that's about it for this one,-1
I'll be reviewing the DVD version of Fantastic Four,0
(uhh) I was really disappointed with this movie you know,-3
I wasn't I'm not a huge fan of Fantastic Four,-1
"My limited experience with comics to begin with but this just, was just kind of a an (uhh) movie, you know",-1
"It's just kind of the big, super slick you know, action blockbuster that's you know, a lot of lot of (stutter) you know, colors, a lot of style but not really much substance behind it",1
(uhh) You know Michael Chiklis does a pretty good job but he's really the only (uhh) you know decent actor,0
"You know, the people the people (stutter) who get this you know, Jessica Alba's a good actress too but (uhh) he just you know, gives a pretty decent performance or worthwhile performance you know, a bunch",0
"(uhh) You know, if you don't know what it's about (uhh) you know it's a team of scientists that go up into space to explore this kind of radiation field that's going by earth and you know it ends up you know destroying their station and when they get back they all develop super powers you know",-1
Four of em become the Fantastic Four and you know the fifth one (uhh) becomes you know the evil (uhh) the evil (uhh) the evil villain you know that they have to fight and save the world against,1
"(umm) You know like I said, it's it's (stutter) an alright movie",1
It's it's (stutter) a popcorn flick you know definitely,-2
"It's not even, unfortunately it's not even that great of a popcorn flick but you know, if you like this kind of movie you know, you probably wanna pick it up",-2
(uhh) Special features is not so bad (uhh) you know,-1
It's got a commentary from some of the actors and the director,1
"(uhh) It's got a video diary from the filming, behind the scenes (uhh) you know some deleted scenes, a making of documentary",1
It's your usual bunch,0
I mean it's not that bad as far as that goes,0
"But (uhh) you know it might be worth checking out, (uhh) you know if you like this kind of thing",1
"Hi, I'm here to review this movie (umm) Jeepers Creepers two on DVD",0
This is the (uhh) special edition DVD,1
(umm) This is the (uhh) second movie,-2
"(umm) There was Jeepers Creepers one, and (umm) I mean I didn't like this movie",-3
(umm) I'm not a really big fan of horror movies,-1
It was about this (umm) high school team,0
They (umm) they get stranded on a (uhh) their bus breaks down and then (umm) they're trying to survive this (umm) this maniacal killer who's like killing them off one by one and (umm) you know he's he's (stutter) selecting who he wants to kill and everything and they're trying to stick together,-2
They're just trying to survive (umm) I mean like anyone would do,-2
They're definitely just trying to survive,0
(umm) It's very gory,0
(umm) So all the killings are really gruesome and (umm) it was really gross,-1
"(umm) Didn't really like this movie, just because of all the blood and all of the (uhh) all the gross, like, sick killing scenes",0
I mean if you're into that kind of stuff then I mean I would suggest it,-1
Okay,1
This is Donnie Darko,0
It's (umm) definitely a cult movie favorite,0
"(uhh) It's, out of five stars, I would give it a five",2
"(umm) It follows this boy Donnie Darko, played by (uhh) Jake Gyllenhaal",3
And He's he's a very weird kid,3
(umm) He sees this this (stutter) like demented bunny who tells him when the world is going to end and Donnie just has to figure everything out,0
(umm) It's definitely dark,-1
(uhh) Not recommended for kids at all,1
"(umm) I really like how it's done because, if you watch this movie five times you will still not understand everything about it",-1
(umm) There's just so much things,-1
"It it (stutter) involves like, (uhh) theoretical physics and just so much stuff and Donnie Darko no matter how weird he is is still really funny",1
"Hi, I'm Bruce and today I'm reviewing The Host which is now out on DVD",0
"This is actually a Japanese film, it's a monster movie",0
It was (uhh) very well (uhh) reviewed on the (uhh) the movie poster (umm) and so I was (uhh) taken in to (uhh) check it out and see if it was a good as the reviewers said,2
Unfortunately it was not,1
"(umm) What you're watching right now is the scene where (uhh) this monster, this (uhh) sea creature is first found",-2
(umm) Where it's about to drop in the water and (uhh) mayhem begins,1
(uhh) But basically it's the story of a dysfunctional Japanese family that (uhh) ends up coming together in order to save (uhh) the young girl that is (uhh) taken (uhh) by this (uhh) sea monster,1
(uhh) I definitely would not recommend it,1
(uhh) We actually had to skip through some of the movie because it just got so drawn out,1
(uhh) But (uhh) if you enjoy seeing foreign films (umm) you might (uhh) have a little fun with it,-2
"(uhh) We (uhh) enjoyed seeing the (uhh) the subtitles (uhh) versus the, the (stutter) dubbed voices, dubbed American voices (uhh) and how the dialogue (uhh) differed from the subtitles on the screen",0
(umm) and so you might enjoy that,0
(uhh) But all in all it's it's (stutter) not a very good movie and so I would not recommend it,1
(uhh) But (uhh) like I said it might be (uhh) good for a laugh (umm) if you really like monster movies or if you (uhh) like Japanese films,-3
"So anyway that's my review of The Host, now out on DVD",-2
(uhh) Available at your local video store or Redbox,1
"Scott Reed talking: I think right now where we are . . . the hardest thing that we face is, having kind of established what the game is, . . . uh, we know we don’t have to keep reinventing the wheel every year and that’s fantastic.",1
But now I think our . . . our hardest work is . . . legitimacy.,0
Making sure that we don’t just build the engaging game but that we’re articulate about our reasoning and our purpose for wanting to do it.,0
Um . . . especially having discovered in the last year that many people in the community are going to have a negative . . . sometimes I’d say even knee-jerk reaction to the idea of playing games and trading cards and having sparkleponies in the context of a professional conference.,1
"Hi, I'm here to review the movie When Worlds Collide",0
(umm) There are really no known actors are in this movie,-1
(umm) It's directed by George Pal who did many other (uhh) science fiction movies during the fifties,0
"In it, an astronomer discovers a planet and it's moon are in a direct collision course (uhh) with the earth",1
He goes to the world governments who think he's a crackpot and really have no interest in building a rocket ship to try to (uhh) save a few people kind of like a Noah's arc to another planet,0
So he goes to private invest investors (stutter) and a few millionaires (uhh) decide yes (uhh) the human population is worth saving,-1
So they give all their money to him,1
"He's able to save forty people (uhh) on his rocket ship, which I found pretty interesting since he has thousands working for him to build his rocket ship and most of them know that hey, the only chance is for forty people getting out so why am I wasting all this time and energy to helping forty people get away when the astronomer, his daughter and her two boyfriends are already guaranteed four of the forty spots on the rocket ship",-1
(umm) The special effects aren't all that good,-2
Hello expo,1
I'm here to review Alien Versus Predator: Requiem,0
(uhh) I went to this movie and I was greatly disappointed but maybe I shouldn't have been at this point cause I shouldn't have expected much from it,-1
(uhh) The movie was a classic Alien Versus Predator,-2
"(uhh) It's pretty much the story of (uhh) a ship crashing, a predator ship crashing, from the (uhh) last one",-1
Crashes on earth in a small town and aliens get loose and start killing all the inhabitants,-3
(uhh) So a Predator has to come and save and hunt these aliens,-1
"(uhh) So I mean if that's what you're after, if you're all after is is (stutter) a Predator killing aliens then fine",-2
"The bad part is there's only one Predator, which kind of sucks",1
So you didn't get to see a bunch of different cool things like in the others,0
(umm) Definitely gets tireless after a while {laugh},0
"Don't expect much in in (stutter) acting or anything like that, it's pretty much just classic Alien Versus Predators",-1
(umm) I would recommend waiting for a movie,-1
(uhh) I don't think you should go see this in theater or even pay matinee for this,-2
Just wait for a movie to come out and enjoy it then,-2
"Hello, today I'm reviewing The Exorcism of Emily Rose (uhh) starring Laura Linney",0
(uhh) This movie is supposed to be based on a true story,1
"(umm) The previews for it looked really really really good, (umm) but it was not quite what I expected",-2
(umm) I expected something more along the lines of an The (stutter) Exorcist (umm) where it actually shows the story of the girl and the priest coming in and and performing the exorcism and going through it step by step like that and that just doesn't happen in this movie,1
(umm) This is actually told (uhh) from the point of view of a priest who (umm) performed the exorcism on Emily Rose,-2
And it starts at his trial,-2
He's on trial for (umm) completing that exorcism and the only time you get to see Emily Rose is actually through flashbacks or through his storytelling,-1
(umm) The parts where you actually get to see her and what she's going through (umm) with demons possessing her are great,-1
"(umm) If the whole movie would've been like that this definitely would've been, you know, one of my top movies of all-time because the part where it's focusing on her is well acted",-2
The girl in this movie did a really really good job,0
You do feel like she's being tormented (umm) but there just was not enough of it to support the movie,-1
"(umm) There are some haunting special features on this one (umm) some commentary, some deleted scenes (umm) and some other featurettes",0
(umm) If I had to rate this one I would say probably leave it alone,2
It's gonna get a one out of five from me,1
(umm) Just not enough of the actual exorcism (umm) to make it worth viewing,2
"Hi, I'm Valerie and today I'm going to be reviewing the movie Fred Claus",0
(umm) It's currently out in theaters and it's about this guy named Fred and he is Santa Claus's brother,1
And it's around the holiday times when everyone's getting ready for Christmas and they're getting all their toys set and (umm) so they have their little family get togethers and (umm) Fred doesn't really get along with anybody really,-1
He thinks the whole situation is silly,1
"So he kind of (uhh) steps in one day and looks after things at the North Pole and then it turns into this big party and everything goes kind of crazy havocy and so, Santa Claus's brother doesn't really like that too much and so I don't know",2
It's (uhh) it's kind of a kid movie,0
I personally didn't really like it,0
I would rate it a two out of five,1
(umm) It seemed like he was just trying too hard I guess,-1
But if you're a really young kid you may find it entertaining and nice,-2
But (umm) not my type of Christmas movie,-2
"So, that's Fred Claus",-2
"(uhh) Go check it out, if you want",-1
"Hi Expo, this is Nikki",1
This is my review on the movie National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation Two,0
(uhh) definitely not as good as the first,0
(umm) I think they were reaching for this one,-3
"(umm), I think since they had (umm) such a good one the first time",-3
"(umm), I think they thought that they could probably put another one together and (umm) my personal opinion, I think they failed miserably, but, you know, again,that's my opinion",-1
"(umm) I wouldn't recommend this to anybody, really",-1
(umm) I was just greatly disappointed,1
"Randy Quaid xxx yeah, {laugh} there's some funny things that he does, but he did those things in the first one",-3
(umm) it's (uhh) not rated,-3
Eighty-three minutes long,-3
"(umm), it should be rated junk",-1
"(umm), so if (uhh) you really want to (umm) yeah, don't don't (stutter) waste your time, it's it's (stutter) really terrible",0
Hello and welcome to my review of the movie Twenty-Seven Dresses,1
(uhh) This movie (uhh) starring Katherine Heigl (uhh) most of you probably know her from (uhh) either Grey's Anatomy (uhh) the ABC tv show,0
Or (uhh) (uhh) you may also know her from the movie Knocked Up,-2
(uhh) Knocked Up was a hilarious movie that I really enjoyed and (uhh) was expecting something along that lines for this movie,1
"(uhh) It's about (uhh) a girl who's kind of proverbially always a bridesmaid never the bride, (uhh) hence the name of the movie Twenty-Seven Dresses",3
(uhh) She's been in twenty-seven different weddings and has twenty-seven hideous bridesmaid dresses to prove it,0
(umm) It's just kind of one of those predictable movies that (uhh) I don't think I would recommend going to see,-1
(uhh) I I (stutter) was pretty disappointed with with (stutter) it overall,-2
"(uhh) It's just you know, I had a few laughs and that sort of thing but nothing you know just, compared to Knocked Up which was just absolutely fall on the floor laughs I didn't think it was nearly as good",-2
"(uhh) You know Katherine Heigl does (uhh) a a (stutter) good job and she is kind of settling into a comedic role, (uhh) so she does a good job acting it's no, not (stutter) a problem with the acting it's more a problem with the story",-1
So overall I would not recommend seeing this movie I would give it two out of five stars,1
Hi,1
"Today I wanted to do a review on the movie, The Heartbreak Kid",1

894} Alright,0
"That clip right there was (uhh) {cough} (uhh) this guy you know he's (umm) had some girlfriends but he's kind of afraid of commitment and (umm) he, for some reason, he is kinda good friends with some of his previous and he was at a wedding of one of his girlfriend's, previous girlfriend's, wedding",1
(umm) There's the movie as you can see,0
Case,0
"But, (umm) what I wanted to say about this movie is that I am going to give it a one out of five stars just because if you have any morals what so ever, you won't watch this movie just because one, it's very crude (umm) so much unnecessary stuff goes on, (umm) seems like there's always sexting or something inappropriate so I don't recommend it for kids and two, it promotes like saying like it's okay to (umm) divorce and just you know garbage like that (umm) which you know there's so much divorce already and in, you know, United States, why do we need a movie saying it's okay so basically what happens he meets this girl and they get married and they go on their honey moon and then he starts hanging out with another girl but I'm not going to ruin it but, yeah",0
Hello Expo TV,0
Today I have for you a review of a movie currently in theaters the Bee Movie,0
"(uhh) In my opinion the Bee Movie is exactly that, a B movie",-2
B here standing for bad,1
"(umm) In some ways I look at this movie as (umm) an attempt, I don't know by either (stutter) the actors in the movie or the company who produced it to get back on it's feet or something it didn't really",-2
"It was supposed to be a comedy, an animation and perhaps a kids movie and it was that",-2
It was a kids movie,-2
It wasn't very funny,-2
It wasn't very entertaining,-3
"(umm) It really didn't (uhh) add anything and give anything know to you know (umm) cinematography (stutter) (umm) It's basically just what the title says, a bad movie, a B movie (umm) and I really do think that",-2
I give it two out of five stars,-1
"(umm) Perhaps you know, (stutters) two out of five instead of one out of five because I did laugh sometimes",-1
(umm) It just didn't do it for me though,-2
It was it was all in all a bad movie,-2
I would not recommend it,-2
"Hi, I'm here to review the movie The House of Yes",0
"Starring Parker Posey, Josh Hamilton, (umm) Tori Spelling, Freddie Prinz Junior",0
(umm) This was a movie about an eccentric rich family living in Massachussetts who are (umm) obsessed by the Kennedys,0
"(umm) Josh Hamilton plays the son, he's bringing his fiance to meet his family for the first time",1
"(umm) His his (stutter) mother tries to buy her off (uhh) but it's his sister Parker Posey who is (umm) completely obscene, {laughs} or not obscene, insane and obsessed (umm) by her brother who probably most frightens us (uhh) in this movie",-1
"(uhh) The movie is billed as a dark comedy but (uhh) I didn't really find it all that funny, I found it kind of ridiculous and (uhh) maybe bizarre",-2
If if (stutter) that's a good word,-2
(uhh) I think the best line in the movie comes from Tori Spelling when she looks at Parker Posey and says no you're not insane you're just incredibly spoiled,2
(uhh) The House of Yes a rounding no,-2
"Hey, y'all",1
"It's the king of movies here, and today I'm going to review ten thousand BC, (uhh) which recently came out in theaters",0
It's (uhh) from the director of Independence Day and the Day After Tomorrow,-1
"And (uhh) while I found those films (uhh), particularly Independence Day, to be pretty good, (umm) (uhh) ten thousand BC fails in that department",-1
"(uhh) It's about basically a, a (stutter) tribe of people who, (uhh) you know, like someone who (uhh) one, one (stutter) person gets (uhh) like a princess kind of deal happens where (uhh) she gets kidnapped and basically the tribe goes out to rescue her and then they meet other tribes and a whole kind of war happens",-2
"(umm) I thought the ending especially was, (uhh) was pretty horrible",0
"(uhh) I don't want to ruin it, but (uhh) they, let's just say that they tried to surprise the audience all of the sudden with (uhh) a kind of (uhh) (uhh) just just (stutter) new (stutter) introduction of new characters, and I thought that was fairly week and disappointing",-2
"(umm) It's, (uhh) it's been getting (uhh) pretty negative reviews by the press, but I tried to go into it with an open mind, (uhh) particularly because I liked Independence Day and (uhh) unfortunately it failed",-1
"The CGI, (uhh) there was a lot of CGI",-2
Some of it's good,-2
Some of it's kind of bad,-3
"(umm) There, it just wasn't my cup of tea",0
"Wasn't well executed, pretty formulaic, bad ending, wouldn't recommend watching it",0
"Hello, today I'm going to review Semi-Pro starring Will Ferrell this is a movie that's basically a vehicle for more crazy Will Ferrell zany antics (uhh) he's playing a basketball player this time and that's basically all the plot there is to it",2
"It really has no plot, just an excuse for Will Ferrell to do crazy dumb things and (uhh) basically I think Will Ferrell might be out of schtick (uhh) all of his movies have been kind of dropping off into being repetitive and dumber and dumber and this one is probably the worst movie he's ever made",-2
"This has happened to a lot of the Saturday Night Live alum and (uhh) speaking of Saturday Night Live movies it's just to give you an idea, I would say of all the bad movies that have ever come out of their characters this one would probably just barely beat Ladies Man",-2
"This is a really bad movie, it has no plot whatsoever and I really had high hopes for it because at his best Will Ferrell can be (uhh) apparently zany and funny, but spent a lot of money advertising (uhh) this movie, had multiple spots during the superbowl",-3
They even put the semi-pro character into the sports illustrated swimsuit edition,0
"You really couldn't get away from it and then you see the movie and really, really disappointing and it kind of think if it spent some money on writing instead of advertising it might have been a little bit better",-2
Hi,0
"Today I'm reviewing the movie, The Happening",0
(umm) The Happening is the latest movie from writer director M,-2
"Night Shyamalan, who previously directed the good movies Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs",1
And the not so good movies The Village and Lady in the Water,-2
"(umm) Unfortunately, this one can't even fit into the not so good movies category (umm) I'll get to that in a little bit",-1
(umm) The movie stars Mark Wahlberg as a science teacher and Zooey Deschanel as his wife (umm) and also stars John Leguizamo as his friend,-2
"And something happens at the beginning of the movie and, for some reason, people start talking funny and killing themselves",-3
(umm) The cause of this is never fully explained,-3
(umm) There are theories that are thrown about and the big theory is pretty silly,-3
(umm) {clears throat} My problem with this movie isn't so much the plot,-3
(umm) It was probably a good idea when M,-1
"Night Shyamalan created it, when he thought of it, (umm) but unfortunately, most of the time, the actors actually find themselves walking or running, rather, away from the wind",0
They run away from the wind,1
"(umm) If that sounds exciting to you then maybe you can go check this movie out, but otherwise, don't bother",-2
(umm) The problem is also that the dialogue and the acting are atrocious,-2
(uhh) That's probably the best word I can use to describe this movie is just atrocious,-3
"(umm) The Village and Lady in the Water were sub-par movies compared to the three movies that he made originally, but they were at least well made films (uhh) this I'm surprised this movie actually got any kind of release, any kind of distribution",-2
The dialogue is horrible,-2
"(umm) Dialogue's never really been his strong suit, but he usually casts decent enough actors or, at least, gets the best out of the actors that he casts to make up for it",0
"(uhh) With Bruce Willis or Mel Gibson, (umm) Paul Giamatti, (uhh) Bryce Dallas Howard, they're all decent actors in his movies",-2
"(umm) I don't know if it was teaming up with Mark Wahlberg, who has is notori notoriously (stutter) wooden actor I don't know if that hurt the film, or not, but he also did not get anything out of John Leguizamo or Zooey Deschanel, who are usually pretty fine actors themselves",-3
"So, I don't know what exactly happened here, but the acting, it feels like the words are being read off of a script",-2
"As you're watching the movie it looks like they're actually looking at cue cards and reading these words for the first time, that's how the delivery is",1
And it doesn't help that the words they're delivering are just dumb,-3
"(umm) I almost walked out of the movie, but I wanted to stay till the end",-3
I wanted to see how it wrapped up,-1
"(umm) The beginning of the film where the construction workers start to kill themselves, it's towards the very beginning of the film, (uhh) that was the first real sign of trouble, for me, was the acting by the lead construction worker",-3
"And, from there, it just went downhill and it went really over the top when (uhh) they were in some diner and a lady is looking at her iPhone, which is horrible product placement, and watching some ridiculous video about a guy in a tiger pit",-3
Obviously CG,-3
Bad CG,-3
Just terribly done,-2
Terribly delivered dialogue while they're watching it,-3
It's just an awful movie,0
I'm only gonna give this one one out of five stars,-1
I don't recommend anybody ever seeing this,-2
(uhh) This is the kind of movie that's gonna to be ridiculed in five years on DVD by drunken Frat boys because it's just that awful,-2
"Hey everybody, this is Tom and today I'm going to be reviewing the movie Hancock",0
"As always, bam, movie ticket, right there",2
Out of the way,-1
"Alright, Hancock",0
It is a Will Smith attempt at making a superhero movie in a summer of really good superhero movies,-2
"Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Dark Knight",0
"Okay, as you can tell I'm doing this a little bit past the point when Hancock came out, but you see where I'm going with this",-2
Hancock is not good,-2
"One, no one has ever heard of this, two, I hope nobody will remember this cause this was a bad movie",-1
"Okay, it had its funny points because it's about a bum on the streets who has superhuman abilities",-2
And eventually he gets himself into trouble where he (stutter) he ends up saving a public relations guy and he tries to build up his image to get people to like him,-3
That is the story of this,-3
(umm) Okay the one thing that drove me nuts was the camera,0
Yes,-1
Half the time the camera was doing three-sixties,2
"So I think I kinda want to do the rest of this review doing nothing but three-sixties but that would drive you guys nuts, cause it drove me nuts",-2
"(uhh) Maybe I was the only one who noticed, who knows",-2
"(uhh) It it (stutter) was funny at times, but, you know, (stutter) it wasn't good enough for me",-2
(stutter) No,-1
"I I (stutter) didn't enjoy it, I I (stutter) just kind of sat there ""Hmm",1
Okay,-2
This was funny,0
"Why am I spending my money watching this?"" {sigh} I think I was more sad that I spent the money to watch this but (umm) otherwise it is funny enough to watch it, but not funny enough to watch it in theaters",1
"Wait to rent it if you're really desperate, buy it if you want to",-3
"(stutter) Don't know, it's more up to you",-2
"I'm going to give this a two out five, hope it helps",2
Hey all,1
It's the king of movies here and today I'm going to review (uhh) The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,0
"Now (uhh) this is a new movie (uhh) starring (stutter) Brendan Fraser, Jet Li, and Maria Bello and it's the third (uhh) movie in the, The Mummy series",-2
I believe the last one was actually in two-thousand-one or two-thousand-three,-1
"It was definitely over five years ago so (umm) this is kind of a surprise in a way to see a sequel so soon, perhaps it's because (uhh) Indiana Jones four came out and people are kind of on that adventure wave right now",-1
"They're, (uhh) they're enjoying their adventure kind of movie",1
"(umm) This movie as as (stutter) the other ones were is is (stutter) not to be taken too seriously, it's pretty much popcorn entertainment",-1
"(uhh) It's just something that you watch, mindless fun (uhh) that you eventually, you know, just forget about pretty much immediately after watching it",1
"(umm) As as (stutter) popcorn entertainment it doesn't really (uhh) (uhh) fail necessarily, but it doesn't do its job as great as say even the first Mummy",0
"(uhh) The movie has Jet Li in it, which is a nice surprise, but I feel that if they (uhh) could have used him more in it (uhh) it would have been movie if they did",1
"(uhh) There's some CGI in, CGI in (stutter) here that isn't very good and (uhh) usually there shouldn't be a problem but (uhh) it just detracts from the experience I think",1
(uhh) (stutter) It ends up being a little (uhh) a little disappointing,0
(uhh) There's also just not that much (stutter) stuff in terms of originality,0
"It's a lot like the other Mummies, if you've seen those and you like them you'll probably want to just see this cause you'll like it too",1
If you're looking for even like a slight twist in the Mummy formula you probably won't wanna bother watching this because you're not going to be getting something like that,0
"So once again, if you, if you (stutter) enjoy just popcorn movies like even Journey to the Center of the Earth, if you like that (uhh) you might want to check this out",-1
"(umm) Unfortunately this one isn't in three D though, so it's not as entertaining but (stutter) I think this is strictly for Mummy fans and people that just want (uhh) some kind of escapist movie to forget about their worries for ninety minutes",-1
And that's my review of The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,-2
"(uhh) In this movie they actually go to China and that's the whole dragon thing and that's why Jet Li is in it, in case you were wondering",-1
Hey expo Tv,1
Today I am going to talk about another summer movie that is currently in theaters,0
Vicky Cristina Barcelona,0
(umm) xxx seen this with a few of my friends and I was much more soft having done so (umm) this film has little substance,-3
It's a Woody Allen film strangely enough which you would think that it would have some substance but not this one (umm) with some big name actors Javier Bardem (umm) Scarlett Johansson and Penelope Cruz all on this film,-2
"And basically what it is, I will give you the basic plot Penelope Cruz, her character and Scarlett Johansson's character (umm) travel to Barcelona (umm) and there you know they are alone and they are young females",0
Basically there they just have (umm) relations with Javier Bardem's character (umm) and he's still involved with with his wife so it's kinda like a love quadrangle not a triangle cause there's three of them and one guy so quadrangle (umm) that's about as deep as the plot gets (umm) they try to do some cheesy plot development and cheesy character development,-1
It doesn't really work,-2
"There's a little bit of humor in the film (umm) I think Woody Allen has an interesting sense of humor, a very dry sense of humor",1
"That I think worked with the film (umm) but originality wise, this movie is nothing that hasn't been made before It's just kinda sleezy (umm) waste of time completes your mind type of thing",-3
"Hey guys, Tina here and I want to do a review for you today of a movie that I just watched on DVD and the movie is called The Haunting, it's The Haunting of Molly Hartley",1
"(uhh) This is a rated R movie on DVD, it's just recently released on DVD and there aren't any well known (uhh) actors in this movie, a lot of no names",-1
I honestly can't name one character for you that I knew in this movie,-1
Some of the faces looked familiar but (umm) not so much that I would be able to name them for you,0
It's basically (umm) based on the haunting of a high school student (uhh) who's haunted by her mother,-1
(umm) Apparently her mother tries to (uhh) kill her when she's younger and (umm) it really haunts her in terms of psychologically,-1
She has to see doctors and so forth,0
"I think it's more of a a (stutter) teen flick more than anything because it revolves a lot of the, the (stutter) things are based in the high school where (uhh) Molly goes to school at",-1
"(umm) I watched it with my eleven year old daughter and she really enjoyed it, she likes scary movies, and it does have some scary points in it",2
"I didn't really care for it, all I could say it's more of a a (stutter) teeny bop movie",-2

I was the first woman from they island to get a degree.,-3

This is why I have always worked hard to improve opportunities for women and other under-represented groups.,-2

The pepper spray incident was one that I will deeply regret for the rest of my life.,2
It has never been something that I want us to forget.,2
We learned from it and we now do a better job protecting you and our campus.,1
Xenca was founded in 2012 by a team of experienced individuals with a thirty year track record of working together successfully in the cosmetics and healthcare industry,2
Their vision was to create a franchise consisting of a team of Associates who all share the same passion for helping people look and feel great,2
"Now Xenca has hundreds of dedicated Associates who all love selling our products, that all tried and tested to really work",2
The beauty of being an Associate of Xenca is that when you're selling our products you know that they will really help people live better healthier life,2
"Hello, I'm Matthew and I'm here to give you my review on this DVD movie called The Feeding",1
It came out in two thousand six and it was directed by Paul Moore,0
"Besides that I can't tell you the rest of the cast, it really has a bunch of nobodies in it",-3
(umm) The storyline is a bunch of college students go camping in the woods and there is a werewolf which is chasing them,-2
This is definitely an independent film,-1
How it got made I don't know,-1
This movie was quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life,0
But almost to a point that was very funny,-3
It was shot on a very low budget,-2
It was shot really kind of grainy,-1
The acting was horrible in it,0
Almost like they were reading cue cards,1
The werewolf costume was completely unbelievable,-1
"And it also had a person in it who kept shooting the wrong, missing the werewolf when it shot at it and (stutter) shooting the college kids",-3
So she ended up killing about four of them because she was such a bad shot,1
"This movie, how it got made I don't know",0
"How it got released on DVD I don't know, but it was quite comical to watch and on a scale of one to ten I would probably give it a one",-1
"Hi, I'm (uhh) reviewing the movie called (uhh) the Epic movie, which is currently in theaters and (umm) you know I've seen commercials on TV and (uhh) it's basically a type of movie like Scary Movie, like the series where they make spoofs of everything, and (uhh) I've seen it on TV and (uhh) it looked (uhh) pretty funny from the (stutter) from the previews that I saw",1
"(umm) I saw that over the weekend, did did (stutter) good in the box office",0
I think it got something like over twenty million dollars,0
"So (umm) I decided to pay ten dollars, you know, go to the movie theater and see it and (uhh) gotta tell you that I'm extremely disappointed in the movie",-3
"(umm) For more than half of the movie, I didn't even laugh",-1
"(umm) The only time I did laugh was at the the (stutter) pretty dirty stuff which they usually don't put in movies but, I mean that was pretty funny to me",1
"(umm) there are a couple of rap music scenes from from BET, that were trying to make fun of, wasn't really funny",-1
"Hey guys, (uhh) I'm going to do a quick review on the movie called Epic Movie",1
"It's basically a movie (uhh) comedy satire (uhh) it's it (stutter) mocks movies such as the (uhh) Da Vinci Code, Nacho Libre, X-Men, (umm) Land of Narnia, (uhh) Chocolate Factory, and some other movies I can't really think of right now",1
(uhh) it it's (stutter) a movie that you don't really don't need brains to go watch it,-1
"It's a lot of toilet humor and cheap laughs, and if you are really really really desperate for that kind of a comedy, I highly recommend this movie for you",-2
"(umm) I mean if you are expecting (uhh) a lot more, I mean with this type of movie I don't think you will enjoy it",-2
"(uhh) It's, it's (stutter) got a pretty, pretty (uhh) low rating (umm) right now, but it's doing very well surprisingly, in the box office",-1
"So if you're really desperate for (uhh) I mean, cheap laughs and that sort of (uhh) genre movie I would highly recommend (uhh) this movie to you",0
"Hey guys, this PlatfromerFan.",0
I'm here tonight because I just have something to get off my chest.,-1
If you guys ever followed the Machinima Youtube channel than you were probably aware of the show called All Your History Are Belong to Us.,-1
"You were probably aware of the controversy involving the new format of the show went through a few weeks back, mainly involving the new host Chris Lockey.",-2
"Well recently the show has been cancelled, and I think now it's time to get something off my chest.",-2
"It's obviously too little, too late, but I just feel the need.",-1
I...personally feel that Chris Lockey was a great host.,1
"Flawed, yes, but he would've gotten better if we had given him a chance.",-1
"But, we never really did, and instead of leaving good, constructive criticism most of us just decided to leave complaints.",-2
"And now, because of that, Machinima got intimidated, and decided to shut down the show entirely: costing us a good quality series and Chris Lockey a job.",-1
"But seriously, it go- the hate got out of hand, people.",-2
"When Rob Talbert, the previous host, says it got out of hand it got out of hand.",-2
"KATHLEEN MCCARTNEY: I'm Kathleen McCartney, president of Smith College.",1

Our first MOOC reflects Smith College's ambitions and values in six important ways.,3

"It invites dialogue and debate, hallmarks of learning and development.",1

"The time is now to tap into this group who is passionate about the future of psychology, but have allowed others, often the same people over and over again, to assume leadership roles.",1
"But, where has this gotten us?",0
Those times are over.,-2
I am the only candidate for president who is both a lawyer and a psychologist.,1
"During these recent difficult times, a president with knowledge of the law and a strong allegiance to ethical and legal principals affecting our profession is necessary.",-1
I am that person.,1
The past three presidents of the United States have worked toward achieving mental health parity.,1

"If you're looking for a degree in entrepreneurship, we have an excellent program.",2
The advantages of an education in entrepreneurship is that it gives you that foundation that broad foundation of education and some practical simulations and experience that will help you to be more successful.,1
The courses for online are geared for everything specialized for an entrepreneur versus being general and in online it fits also because entrepreneurs can be anywhere in the world.,0
"While taking my degree I have lived most of the time Nigeria, Africa.",1
I started while in the US.,2
"I barely took three courses before I had to go back home as my job demanded, and so every other course since then has been from Nigeria.",1
Part of what makes our program different is the faculty that we have teaching it.,1
"They're entrepreneurs themselves and so they know about the curriculum, and they know about putting it in action.",1
I remember takin a course on enterpreneurship and that seemed like the entire reason why I was here.,2
This is the movie Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,0
"(umm) I really couldn't watch the whole show, but basically it's about (uhh) the blood orchid is a rare flower and it holds the secret to eternal life and they start to (uhh), you know they go into the jungles to find, to hunt for it",-3
"And of course they, the (uhh) stories about an (stutter) anaconda and so you they find this giant anaconda that (umm) was in the movie and I couldn't even stand to look at it",-3
So (uhh) I didn't watch the whole show but if you are afraid of snakes or anything you'd probably have your eyes closed the whole movie so I I (stutter) didn't like it,-2
Just looking at this cover with the snake on it I don't like it,-2
Anyways this is (umm) let me see if they have any special features,0
"The special features are deleted scenes, previews, and (uhh), and the making of the feature so",-1
"All of the actors are (uhh) let's see Johnny Mess, Messner (stutter) KaDee Strickland, Matthew Marsden, Eugene Bird, Salli Richardson-Whitfield, Nicholas Gonzalaz",-1

But I didn’t want to relinquish the podium at the outset without mentioning that we’re obviously – find this attack reprehensible in every possible way.,-2
"We’re looking at dozens, if not several dozens, of casualties in this strike on what was clear that was a medical facility.",-3
"The details and the circumstances of the attack are still coming in, but it sure bears all the hallmarks of the kinds of strikes that the regime has done in the past on treatment facilities and, frankly, on first responders.",-1

"So innovation, once again, is key.",1
"But the users itself, you can really target a lot better than previously, but not just on that, but targeting based on what they’re watching and what they’re doing offline and how to bring that into the on line space.",0

Today I'm going to be sharing with you my favorite Gillette product.,1
And it is the Venus razors.,2
This one in particular is the Venus Breeze razors.,0
And I really like these because it's basically a two-in-one on the razor.,1
"So you still have the three blades, but then you have these little-- it's like a gel soap bar on each end of the razor.",2
So you actually don't need to have a shaving cream or lather on your leg.,1
You can actually just shave straight with this.,1
"I like the Breeze ones a little bit better, because I've noticed this doesn't tend to-- the jelly soap doesn't tend to melt as fast as some of the other brands.",2
"Or not the other brands, but the other types that Venus has out there.",1
And it lasts a little bit longer.,0
"- The financial aid process was a long, arduous one for me to learn about.",-2
There are tons of different financial aid; each college does it differently.,0
Sometimes you might have to learn about how one school does it and how another.,0
"There's a lot of similarities a lot of times so they can transfer, but you always have to be specific with any college that you look into.",1
"What I learned is that some colleges give you a hundred percent, or a hundred percent of financial aid of tuition and board and that sort of thing.",1

"This is a new movie (uhh) in which a character is confined to his house, he is under house arrest, and his mother takes away his Xboxes and TV as sort of a little bit of additional punishment",1
"So he starts watching out his window, watching people for entertainment until he sees (uhh) something that basically (uhh) horrifies him",-2
He thinks his neighbor is actually a murderer but there is really nothing that he can do about it because he is under house arrest,-2
(uhh) If this plot sounds very familiar I think I saw this movie (uhh) many years ago,-2
"It actually came out about forty years and it was called A Rear Window and it starred Jimmy Stewart, and he was confined to his house because his leg was broken and in general I think that is a much better movie than the movie I have just seen in theaters",0
(uhh) I kind of felt a little bit cheated because (uhh) the plot is (uhh) very similar,-1
"You know, Jimmy Stewart relies on the people around him and his girlfriend to kind of investigate and figure out what was going on",0
Saw a lot of the same things happen in this movie and (uhh) this movie felt a little bit cheaper,1
They kind of tried to stylize it a little bit (uhh) for the younger audience but in general (uhh) I really didn't think it was worth the money,-2

Today I'm going to be reviewing the two disc special edition of The Hulk widescreen,0

"So basically it's a, it's a story, this is a story about a man who who (stutter) suffers because he can't control his anger, but also uses this anger to lash out at society and his oppressors",-1
The movie kind of glosses over a lot of the (uhh) (stutter) a lot of the things that you could say with a story like that in favor of just pure action,-2
"The Hulk smashing tanks and smashing helicopters and jumping thousands of miles, and while that's entertaining it's I also don't think that's enough",-2
"I think you could have done a little bit more with this movie, with the subject matter",0
"But portraying him as a tortured soul a little bit better, I don't know",0
"But as it is, it's a, it's a (stutter) fairly entertaining movie but very, very brainless",-1
"(uhh) The special effects are nice, but not enough to warrant any kind of purchase or rental",0
I kind of wish I didn't have this,-1
I give it a two,-2

"Drilling on the Transversales vein, at its San Felipe Project in Sonora State, confirmed the continuity of a new vein both along strike and to depth.",0
"Additionally, 3 parallel veins have been identified at surface in the footwall over the currently defined strike length of the main Transversales vein, but have not been drill tested.",1
These veins average 5 metres in width each.,1
"(map in release) Of the 11 drill holes reported, hole SCVT-02 reported 11.8 metres of 116 grams per tonne silver equivalent.",1
"The weighted average intercept of the reported assays is 2.6 metres of 199 grams per tonne silver equivalent, with 69 grams per tonne silver, 2.7% zinc, 0.17% copper, 0.99% lead, which is slightly lower than the current resource grade at San Felipe.",1
Drilling has traced the strike at transversales to 200 metres and a depth of 240 metres and it remains open along strike and at depth.,1
"Arturo Préstamo Elizondo, President and CEO stated, ""The confirmation that the surface outcroppings of the Transversales vein appear well mineralized along strike and to depth indicate a highly mineralized system.",1
"This, together with parallel-mineralized systems and an untested structural corridor of at least one kilometer significantly increases the potential of the San Felipe Project."" Jennings Capital stated, ""We like the broader exploration potential of San Felipe, in particular the Las Lamas vein that only accounts for 5% of the approximately 50 million ounces silver equivalent resource and has averaged silver grades above 140 grams per tonne during this round of drilling."" According to management, Rosario continues to ramp up tonnage as additional faces and stopes are opened.",1
Management expects throughput to achieve 300 tonnes per day by the end of the year as both main veins contribute to production.,1

"Now this is sort of, I don't know, being a little, you know, you really want to look at it.",0

"I mean, I'm trying to kind of make it a little bit comical, but to be really honest with you, it really gets to be that way sometimes for some photographers.",-1
"Where as they started out doing something they love and ended up actually hating it and just doing it for money, and in the end, I think sometimes that really shows.",-1

We did sort of push-pull kind of strategy,0
"When we initially launched the system we decided that we were going to our BIS team and find all of our users that have already been logged on customers to our Internet site, and take those user names and push them into the Widen system and then market to those specific users, letting them know what kind of new system we were creating, what were the advantages of it, and push that out to them",0
"We did a full back cover spread on our very first catalog when we launched the marketing toolbox, identifying what it was, how easy it was to use, and we came up with a quick little slogan to use to try to get them to understand that it was fast, easy and simple, which was basically our slogan that we used",1
"And we highlighted it on that catalog that gets distributed out to about 10,000 addresses, which is a very large audience, to see how many would actually log on to our website, and come in and see the toolbox",1
We gave that roughly about a couple months to see how that settled in,0
Then we followed up with an email blast to identify that this new system was here and what were the advantages of using the system,0
Then we followed up with a survey,0
"We particularly were talking about our catalogs, and our sourcebooks and our marketing materials, but we felt that that was the perfect opportunity to then ask if they had seen the marketing toolbox advertised on the back of our catalog or advertised through our email blast, which gave us some insight as to how many people were really knowledged about it and what step we needed to take to implement further from there and whether we could move into a training position or whether we needed to continue on with our marketing efforts",2
"From that we felt like there was a good enough number of customers who had seen it in the few places that we had put it out, and we moved into our training phase, which was launching WebExes a couple times a week for a few consecutive weeks in a row, and putting out open lines to all of our customers saying that they could attend a particular WebEx",2

Well most people who understand how to piece together their own self driving car are smart enough not to do something stupid enough to seriously harm themselves or others",1

"As far as the man who died from a fault in Tesla’s most recent autonomous driving iteration, it’s sad and it weighs heavy on Tesla’s conscious",0

Hi my name is Zach Parry,0
"Today I am going to be answering the question, ""Is it legal to surf the deep web?"" To answer that questions let's first get an understand what deep web is",0
"Because, when you get on Google on run a research and you're looking for information you're actually surfing the shallow web, if you will",0
,1
"Index meaning, Google has it in their algorithm and it could be a potential search result",0
The deep web is the unindexed portion of the internet,1
It's all that information that people put online that doesn't run through Google or that Google or other search engines cannot see,-1
"In fact, the vast majority of information online is in the deep web",1
And a lot of it is pretty benign,1
Just because the information is uncharted or unmapped down't mean there is anything illegal about it,0
"For example, if you were to get on the Clark County recorders website and you want to search recorded documents associated with a certain parcel number, or were you to get on a Clark County assessor's site or the Clark County District Court website and you wanted to search different cases, none of that is indexed",-1
"In order to find that, you can't go through Google, you have to go through the portal on respective web sites",1
So all that public information is unindexed and therefore as part of the deep web,1
"Yet, there's nothing wrong with searching for that information",0
"So, the question really is, what is it that you're looking for on the deep web, because certainly there are illegal activities going on beneath the radar of what is indexed",0
"So, yes it is legal to surf the web",2
"In and of itself, searching this information, and looking at information that is not indexed is not illegal",1
There is nothing wrong with that,1
"The question is, what is it that you're doing because some of the activities on there, if you were looking for a contract killer, for example, that would be illegal",1
So the answer depends on what the actual behavior is,0
But surfing the deep web in and of itself is perfectly legal,0

"In addition to the very valid point made about monetary matters Islamic banking is also fraudulent another front Nabbi Mohamed Alaahis Salatu Wasallam would sometimes buy goods and he would not have the money to pay for it for.The shop keeper would give him time to pay when you buy in you given time get paid this is called a credit transaction credit transaction.So a credit  transaction is halal in Islam but there is no evidence that the shopkeeper was allowed to raise his price because he had to wait for his money and so credit price and cash price had to be the same if credit price is higher than cash price, higher purchase or Murabaha.If credit price is higher than cash price the difference between the two would be because of time that money can increase over time.",-2
If you believe that money can increase over time you are misguided.,1
Dangerously misguided because Allah says no money cannot increase over time that transaction is invalid that is Ribah.,-2

The trailer is just in the background right now.,0
It's about a 15-20 second trailer.,-1
And you know it shows a band getting ready to go on stage.,-1
There was some interesting things i noticed about the trailer.,0
Like the first thing you'll see is that there is a guy holding a guitar pick.,1
And we've heard rumours in the past that the new guitar hero would be much more realistic in it's approach to the series.,1
Maybe it could be something similar with what we've seen with Rocksmith with allowing people to play real guitars.,0

"Well, we'll start out by talking about the divide and conquer algorithm design paradigm, in particular with applications to fast searching, sorting and multiplication.",2
"Second, we'll talk about several blazing fast algorithms for manipulating and reasoning about graphs.",1
Such as computing connectivity information and also shortest paths.,0

So continuing with the bankruptcy theme I wanted to talk about some other brands that have filed for bankruptcy in the last few years,-1
"One very notable one is American Apparel, especially since they've filed bankruptcy twice within the period of a little bit over a year",-1
That's kind of crazy,1
"Other brands include Pacific Sunwear, Cache, Wet Seal, and Quicksilver",0
And if you kind of listen to the names of these brands you might figure out that there's a pattern,2
A lot of these are very teen specific or sort of focus on a younger customer,1
I think there's sort of three big reasons why these types of companies are having trouble,0
Number one is that trends are moving a lot quicker than they used to when I was a teenager,1
They're not as stagnant and there's been a huge acceleration over the past ten years of teen trends,1
The second thing is that teen trends used to be a much more segregated niche,-2
But they're much more influenced now by the designer runways because of internet easy access to viewing collections online,-1
"Teen trends used to be very isolated from runway trends but now with the rise of the internet and also access to cheap runway copies, any potential business for these outdated teen retailers has sort of been absorbed by companies like H&amp;M, Zara, Forever 21, and other online niche brands",0
The third thing is that social media celebrates diversity,0
"When I was a teenager there wasn't social media and it was much more common to just want to fit in, to look like your peers, to dress like your peers",1
But today if you want to stand out online you have to be different and how many Instagram followers you have sort of overrides what your peers think of you,-1
"So if you are the kid in school that has the most followers out of that anyone else, then you probably are the cool kid in school because you have the biggest following you have the biggest influence",-1
"And I think that you know it's sort of like just like the the value of sort of businesses, bloggers, and brands are sort of partly based off of the influence they have and how many followers they have teenagers acceptance among peers is also sort of based off of your influence your online influence",2
And these troubled brands they just really didn't utilize this at least not fast enough,1

"Not only is it  increasing to £600 per pupil but also taking in many more students, reaching many more disadvantaged students who deserve that extra chance.",1
An extra half a million students will be taken into the pupil premium.,2
The pupil premium is already making a big difference in schools.,1
"Schools are using it to pay for one-to-one tuition, extra catch-up classes,  parent support advisors, all the things we know make a difference for children who are falling behind.",-1
It's simply not good enough that how well you should do at school is so dependent on your parents' background.,1

Leadership of Board committees is a really important part of their success.,2
The Governance Committee on most Boards is responsible for helping to populate the Board with all of the needs that it has and should be looking long term for the talents that it needs to meet the different needs of each of the committees.,0
The selection is usually made by the Board Chair for committee chair leaders.,0
So the Board Chair is the person who invites and makes the decision about committee chairs.,-1
Usually it's with the advice and recommendation of a Governance Committee.,1
Some Boards have a tradition of having Vice Chairs for the Board as well as for committees.,0

"I think the most important point, where I want to start, is that: Don't look at the native speaker as if they're up here, and better than you in any way, because sadly, that is why a lot of people get awkward and stop talking around native speakers because they think: ""The native speaker's English is just so good, I'm going to sound like an idiot next to them",-1

Let's answer another Final Cut Studio question.,0
"Sandra writes, ""I have twelve GB of system memory, yet when I'm working on a complex project  FCP will give me out of memory flags.",2
What is this?,-1
This is especially frustrating when I have sent the project to compressor and I've already spent an hour processing I  get the failed response.,-1
"My life is over, I'm going to start walking in front of large moving buses."" Phew, wow, that's a lot of responsibility.",0
"Sandra, the fact that you've got twelve gigabytes of ram on your system does not mean Final Cut takes advantage of it.",1
"The way that Final Cut is currently written and why we're all looking forward to a rewrite is that currently Final Cut only accesses four gigabytes of RAM, regardless of how much RAM you have on your computer.",0
"In fact, having RAM on your computer is only  part of the equation.",0
"Once the RAM is there, the programmers need to write  the program to take advantage of the extra RAM.",-1
This is the big reason why thirty-two bit versus sixty-four bit is such a big deal.,1
Programs were written originally with a thirty-two-bit limitation.,-1
"That is to say that the most RAM they could access was four gigabytes, that's what that thirty-two bit refers to, is how much RAM a program has access to.",1
"By opening up the RAM from thirty-two bits to  sixty-four bits, the RAM goes from four gigabytes into the petabyte range, I mean it's just vast beyond words to describe, which means probably by next week we'll figure out a way to fill it up     but the fact is, Final Cut needs to have it's software actually recoded, rewritten to be able to support   the additional RAM that you've got.",-2
"So the reason you're getting an ""out of memory"" is that you're filling that four gigabyte limit.",0
"Now it's even smaller than that because one point five gigabytes of that four gigabyte RAM is tied up with what are called frameworks, stuff the application needs to be able to function, and only two point five gigabytes is available for your data.",-1
"The ""out of memory"" flag exists because your Browser is so full of stuff, either clips or sequences, and probably sequences, that is filling that two point five gigabyte limit to the point where Final Cut can't function.",1
The way you solve this problem is to get rid of clips in the Browser and get rid of sequences in the Browser that you no longer  need.,0
"The most commonly asked questions by AdWords advertisers is ""why aren't my ads showing?"" It's a legitimate concern, but there is an equally legitimate response coming from Google.",-1
There are three distinct reasons why you may not be seeing your ads.,-1
The first is your previous search history.,-1
"The second is a budgetary and billing concern, and the third is your actual selection of delivery methods.",1
Budgetary and billing concerns are often the most overlooked reasons as to why your ads are not delivering.,1
"In AdWords, daily and monthly budgets are set to reflect what you would like to see from your campaign spend.",2
If your daily or monthly budget has been depleted your ads will no longer show as it's simply a factor of the click costs you can accrue within your budget.,0
Make sure to check your billing tab if your ads aren't showing.,0
"It's possible that there is an issue with the method of payment, an outstanding balance, or something that's causing the credit card to not process.",0
This is a definite reason why your ads will not be showing.,-1
If your billing cannot be processed Google cannot show your ads.,0
Your previous search history can effect your delivery profoundly.,0

The distance we have to treat around where the cancer is because of uncertainties is so much less now than what it was before.,1
"We, in reality, our patients now are imaged every day.",1
We feel that we're precise to within a couple of millimeters.,1
And so we can incredibly precisely target their tumor.,1
"The ability to take a patient who has a tumor of the tonsil or the tongue base or the larynx and treat them with radiation, spare function, so spare them a laryngectomy where the entire voice box is removed and still cure their cancer with radiation is incredibly powerful.",2
"I think the most important thing with patients is to be honest and to, you know, be up front about what they should expect.",1

My name is Victor Macias.,2
"I am the co-founder of Malestandard.com, and today I am excited because I have another product to review for you guys.",2
"This time, the good folks over at Axe have asked us to review their new Apollo line.",2
So I have the shampoo and conditioner here and I have the new deodorant here.,1
"So in Male Standard fashion, the first thing we did was we looked at the shampoo and conditioner and we examined the scent.",1
Now what I have here is the Fresh scent.,1
"And if you've seen reviews in the past or read the reviews on our website, you'll see that we are big fans of subtle scents when it comes to shampoos and conditioners or body washes.",1
Now the main reason is because a lot of us like to wear cologne at night.,1
"So if you have a really overpowering scent, it will clash and just create something that's really not what we wanted.",1
"So what we liked is it definitely has that fresh, light scent.",3
"It almost has like a spearmint type of scent to it, and after using it, you could subtly smell it, but it wasn't overpowering.",1
And it cleans very well.,1
It definitely created a good lather and left my hair feeling really good and really clean.,2
Next up is the Axe 24 hour deodorant.,2
Now this is the same scent.,2
"It's the Fresh, but it is noticeably stronger.",3
"Now that's not necessarily bad, especially if you're a fan of the scents of Axe and you plan to wear a body scent after.",1
This could be your primary scent to wear after you go to the gym or something.,1
"It definitely, it worked.",1
"I'm not an overly sweaty person, but I did feel dry, and when I wore this product I did not wear any other fragrances with it.",2
And I got a lot of good compliments actually from it.,2
"One definitely from my girlfriend, and it's not just because she's my girlfriend because I have tried other products and have not had favorable results sometimes.",2
So this is definitely something good.,1
But what really excited me was the campaign that they told us about.,1
"Now if you go to Wal-Mart and you purchase a package of specially marked Apollo Axe, you'll find a code.",1
"With that code, you'll be able to go to a special website and the link is going to be at the bottom of this YouTube video, and it'll also be on malestandard.com, and you enter the code.",1
"If you select a winning package, you could win a trip to space.",2
"I mean, how many of you have seen those commercials from Axe where it's showing the astronaut and the girl's going all crazy for the astronaut?",2
"That could be you if you enter the code, if you purchase the right product.",2
"So overall, for an Axe product, we definitely dug it.",1
"We've tried different Axe products and I'd say this is our favorite so far, especially the scent.",2
The Fresh scent is really good.,2
And the opportunity to go into space is awesome.,1
So we will be posting this video on Malestandard.com with a more in-depth written review and the link to sign up for the Apollo space camp.,1
To enter for the chance to win is at the bottom of this video and will be on our website.,1
So thanks again for watching.,1

"SECRETARY KERRY: But the dominant truth about the situation in Syria is that, although Assad and Daesh are supposed to be bitter opponents, they are both parts of the same problem.",1
"In fact, the rise of Daesh is directly attributable to the policies and actions of the Assad regime, and that is why we have referred to Assad as a magnet for terrorism.",-1
"This is a case, and there are many in history, in which two supposed enemies are in fact symbolic.",2
Loathing towards Assad drove thousands of Syrians into the arms of Daesh.,2
And fear of Daesh caused some Syrian groups to feel that they had no realistic option but to support the government.,0
"That’s not just symbolic; that’s a symbiotic relationship, each piece dependent on the other.",-1
And the desire to flee both explains the massive refugee crisis that we face today.,-1
The relationship between Assad and Daesh clarifies one of the apparent peculiarities of this conflict – that the two extremes have only rarely targeted one another.,1

"We will consider then, just like we do for domestic students , an international student’s parents income and assets and then make a determination of what that family contribution will be over four years.",1
"This is different, a little bit different for international students in that we do set that family contribution for four years and it is not adjusted and an international student would not need to reapply for financial aid once they have had a family contribution set for them.",1

"Ruben Burga: I've been able to go through academic conferences overseas, and also within Canada, to be able to present my research",1
I've also been able to participate in award-winning papers that have resulted from different aspects of my research,1
My last two papers actually resulted from having participated in research that originated at the University,1
"A co-author and myself sat together with our advisor and created some research that really delved into conceptually, how do students learn? That related back again to some of the research I was doing towards organizational leadership",1
Jamie Gruman: What I like the most about working with the PhD students is they're skilled and they're hungry,1
They want to learn,2

These are both great things to have on hand with you.,1

"All right, we are talking about different types and styles of dress and wardrobe choices, and we just briefly talked about business casual.",0
Now I want to talk about the opposite of that which is commonly referred to as elegant and refined.,-1
Before we started working with CENTORRINO Technologies we had a local firm that worked with us,0
Same gentleman most of the time came,0
It was a little limiting,1
He didn't have a knowledge of how the CEO worked and what the requirements were,1
And so we just found that he just couldn't service us the way we needed to,1
"We found out about CENTORRINO Technologies through a couple of other schools, one in Torquay who were using CENTORRINO Technologies at the time and another one up in the western area",2
They were using CENTORRINO as well and had good reports back about those so we thought we'd have a chat,0
What CENTORRINO Technologies have done for us is really been able to give us surety in how our system works,1
Before CENTORRINO Technologies I had to go down to the server every night before I left and throw another tape into back it up and take these with me and it was often you would forget those sort of things,0
It was always a constant worry that it wasn't actually working,1
And now everything is backed up offsite by CENTORRINO Technologies and we don't have to worry about it and I know that it is there because we have had to retrieve it before,1
So what we get with CENTORRINO Technologies is an overall package,1
"We pay a fixed fee and we get unlimited support - that's phone support, people coming down to work on our system or email support",-1
It means that we can look to the future as well and bring on new systems or new products and they are going to be able to service those,1
We added some iPads earlier this year and they are going to be managing those for us into the future,0
It just means that we can bring our technology forward without having to worry about knowing how to manage it,1
We've got Mac and PCs here,1
We are leaning towards more of a Mac school and that's been something that has been a real bonus for us,1
Having someone from CENTORRINO Technologies who understands Macs,2
We had a lot of trouble in the beginning to get that to happen but now that we've got someone who comes down here regularly to work on those,1
It just meant they are a lot easier to run,2
For teachers and students it really again means that they can most of the time be sure if our network is up because everything is working properly - that they can just run their day,1
"Teachers can just come to school, know that if they want to run a YouTube clip for the children first thing in the morning, that it is going to work",-1
That if they want to connect up to their interactive whiteboard that they know that its going to work,-1
The children when they are sent off to use the iPads or the computers know that they are going to work,1
And that's what makes teaching so much easier,0
"And from my perspective as an administrator, I'm also the IT person here it means that I am not running around trying to fix things, because they just work",2
"Yes, I will recommend CENTORRINO Technologies and have in the past recommended them",0
I believe that they have the ability to know what the needs of our schools are,1
"I tend to prefer that type of arrangement (sponsorship) rather than kind of random advertising because, if you're signed up with a random group of advertisers you never really know what you are going to get in your podcast and I'm always a little worried, as a producer, of getting that one ad that just offends my entire audience and destroys the listenership I have.",-1
"MR KIRBY: On to the bombings in Iraq, the United States condemns the bombings yesterday claimed by Daesh of a market in Sadr City, Baghdad, which killed over 70 people and wounded – right now looks like more than a hundred.",-1
We also condemn Daesh’s attack on security personnel in the Baghdad neighborhood of Abu Ghraib.,2
"Frankly, we see this kind of – these kinds of attacks as an act or acts of desperation by Daesh, targeting Baghdad as they are to sow fear after it’s been largely forced out of Ramadi.",1

And I want to talk to you today about business cards.,2
"So I work with a lot of clients as a professional organizer and the one common denominator between all of my clients are these little stacks of business cards just like everywhere in the house, in the kitchen, the entrance way, the bathroom, the office, the toy room.",3
Like why are there business cards in the toy room?,1
"Your kids don't want to play with Joe Smith, the plumber's business card.",1
"They want to play with Mr. Potato Head, LEGOs and dress-up.",1
"So it's time to gather all those cards that don't belong in the places where they're currently at and put them in a system that is going to be easy to put away, easy to find, and easy to grab when it's time to look for that card to contact that person that you've been meaning to contact for months.",1
So I'm going to show you what I do.,2
"Since I'm a business owner, I go to a lot of networking events and I go to a lot of workshops and I'm constantly meeting new people and exchanging business cards.",2
"And when I do that and I get a new card, I come home, I empty my purse and I put my cards into this jar that I got from the craft store.",2

"Hey guys, this is David over at A Secure Life",0
Today we're doing a review of Frontpoint Home Security Systems,1
Frontpoint is actually been our #1 pick for 9 years running,0
And this is primarily due to their incredibly high levels of customer service and the way that they handle their sales process - it's a lot lower pressure than some of the other companies out there,2
We're going to do a deep dive and go into what really sets Frontpoint apart from it's competitors and what you're going to get if you do decide to go with Frontpoint,2
Frontpoint Security Systems are both 100% wireless -meaning that the sensors in your home all wirelessly communicate to your control panel - as well as 100% cellular monitoring - which means that a burglar can't cut your phone line and bypass the security system,-1
If you're in a very rural area you may or may not be able to get monitoring service where you live so just make sure to call and check with Frontpoint,1
"Unlike some other companies, Frontpoint has done a really great job of being transparent with their pricing and their fees",1
You can see all of them on their website,1
They also offer a 30-day money-back guarantee which will allow you to test out the sensors and the system in your home,1
"They are not the cheapest option on the market when it comes to monitoring, but we feel that they have a really great overall value",1
"So if you're okay with paying just a tiny bit more, but getting great customer service and a great customer experience, we think you'll really like them",1
"So we've talked about it throughout the entire review, but honestly what sets Frontpoint apart is customer service",0
So we've actually done quite a few phone calls that were mystery shopping Frontpoint - making sure that we understood how they treat their customers when it comes to tough issues or complaints or sales,1
"And we were really impressed by how much time they were willing to take, by how patient they were and how little pressure there was during the sales process",-1
It was focused around answering questions instead of trying to up-sell us home automation or an extra camera,2
"Frontpoint uses a combination of cutting edge technology, equipment and customer service all at a great price",1
"It's a really hard combination to beat, and for the last 9 years, nobody has",1
