Hi, my name is Raj Shah.
I'm from Spectro Coating, I'm Vice President of the operations.
Key Polymer brings a technical aspect to our operation that we don't have internally.
We're a huge user of adhesives for our operation, called flocking, and we don't have the technical inside compounding or the technical expertise to do these types of things.
Key brings those types of aspects to a business on new markets, new potentials, and even on our equipment of how things run and operate with a pretty big, long experience with their team.
I've been working with Key Polymer for a couple of years.

It's important for teachers to understand their legal, ethical, and professional obligations in an educational setting.
the state of American education
A 1983 report, “A Nation at Risk,” argued that America itself was “being eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity
” [President Ronald Reagan:] "Look at the record
Federal spending on education soared eightfold in the past twenty years, rising much faster than inflation
But during the same period, Scholastic Aptitude Test results went down, down and down
" President Ronald Reagan blamed the professional bureaucracy of education
And in part, Al Shanker did too
For decades as a teacher and activist, he had complained about the burden of bureaucratic interference
"Now, that word 'professional' is becoming more and more of a dirty word for teachers
It is a word which the administrator uses when he turns around anything which he doesn't like that the teacher is doing
To me specifically, social justice means that there isn’t really a separation between people based on their age, based on their religion their beliefs, their country of origin, things like that.
Ultimately no matter who you are or where you are, you have an equal opportunity to participate and be an active citizen in your own society and also in the world.
I think social justice is extremely important for young people.
I’m approaching it from the angle of youth empowerment though because I think that in this time where we are experiencing economic crisis, where there is an unprecedented amount of unemployment, I think that young people naturally have a very creative mind and a lot of time and I think that if young people try to follow in the footsteps of those who came before them they are going to fall in to the same traps.
So to me I think a part of the conversation has to be entrepreneurship and specifically social business because to me social business is a huge part of how we can all achieve inclusion and social justice essentially.
When you are young I think it is important to already start out with the mindset that the choices that I make have an impact on the rest of the world, the choices that I make, for myself, can have social impact.
You know that I think listening to young people, taking in what they have to say because what we have seen all around the world is the power of youth.
But it doesn’t have to escalate to the point of unrest.
^it's amazing to see their enthusiasm and their passion
^And all of them are really being able to explore ^these different areas in depth ^in a way that really wasn't available ^before the center was here
^- The work that I'm doing at the Human Right Center ^is that I am annotating a memoir about ^_ and genocide
My goal is to become a human rights lawyer
- The experience with the center was really informative of what I ended up doing after I graduated
In fact, it's sort of how I got my job
I ended up going to work for the US government as an intelligence analyst, specializing in war crimes and human rights issues
That included doing early warning of potential ^human rights violations and war crimes around the world
^- I think it's very important for any student ^if you're gonna have a leadership role ^in business or politics and law, finance
Having at least an awareness and sensitivity to human rights issues is critical in today's world
"I just have a passion for it
It's so fun, and it's a great workout
And number two, it's awesome

Ukrainian consumers could receive gas from Russia at a price of $247 per 1,000 cubic metres.
But our Ukrainian partners rejected this possibility for reasons unknown to me.
It is common knowledge that the reverse-flow gas that they (Ukraine) are receiving from several European countries costs $20-30 more for consumers.
People who know about this have to think about it one more time.
Is it cheaper to receive Russian gas, or to get reverse-flow gas for $20-30 dollars more than the Russian price.
That means paying the price of $270-280 per 1,000 cubic metre, that's the possible price for the third quarter.
This is Financial Advisor Patrick Munro talking about the benefits of living cheaply.
Alright, now we want to look at the political environment.
Now, what we're talking about when we're talking about politics, or political environment, are they Democrat?
In 2008, there were very serious tribal warfare in Kenya following a disputed election.
And even after the election and the tribal warfare was going on, tribal people were killing one another, but Equity had branches all over the country.
And all the different tribes left Equity Bank alone.
This is Governor Steve Beshear ... About Kentucky Our state is home to more than 1,500 bioscience and lifescience companies and more than 100,000 people who work for these firms, in areas from nutrigenomics and pharmaceuticals to nanotechnology and medical devices.
For the 10th straight year, some of Kentucky’s best and most innovative biotech companies and technologies were on display at the annual BIO International Convention, which I and other state officials attended this week in Chicago.
An estimated 20,000 biotech scientists, executives and industry experts from more than 50 nations were at the BIO conference to learn about the latest scientific advances, and to exchange ideas and establish business relationships.
As governor, I participated in several meetings with executives from high-tech companies who are interested in doing business in, or with, Kentucky.
They were all impressed by the thriving lifescience sector in our state.
As a result of these meetings, one or more of these companies may soon expand their existing Kentucky facilities, or establish new operations in our state.
Kentucky’s participation at the annual BIO International Convention is the primary means by which our high-tech companies and institutions can reach out to the global scientific community.
Our state pavilion provides an eye-catching environment in which Kentucky biotech companies and organizations can meet prospective customers and business partners.
My name is Pat Iyer.
I started a successful Legal Nurse Consulting Business in 1989. I mentor nurses who want to become Legal Nurse Consultants.
In this video I share tips about exhibiting your services at an attorney conference.
One of the things that is most important to do when you consider exhibiting is to think about your goals.
What would you like to get out of this experience?
Here are three goals that you can achieve by signing up to become an exhibitor at an attorney conference.
First exhibiting is a wonderful opportunity to network with other legal vendors.
I have learned a great deal by talking to other legal vendors, then finding out what kinds of conferences that they have attended, where they have found they've gotten the most success.
This has saved me a lot of trouble and expense, by learning more about the field and specifically, about what kinds of ways that I can use to approach attorneys.
Secondly, another goal of exhibiting  is building your company image.
This is an opportunity for you to highlight your products, your testimonials that you have gotten from clients, letters of recommendation and publications.
You can also feature a new product.
When I exhibit attorneys come up to me and say, "So Pat, what's new?
What are you doing that's different?" They always want an answer.
You can highlight a new product, a new service.
You can look at what you want to share with your clients, about what you're doing and what's new in your practice.
Third, another big benefit of exhibiting is connecting with existing clients.

And this secret will also help you if you ever decide to ask out that special someone
So, what is this secret I'm telling you about
Well, it is the secret of power pose

So, first of all, what am I talking about
What is a power pose
Well, for starters, let's look at the word "power"
I've drawn this man here, and if you can tell, he has a lot of big muscles, he looks very strong
Power is similar to strength
You got to visit your family for the holidays and your mom and dad has some big news.
Your dad tells you that he has a recent cancer diagnosis and that they give him six months to live.
He's dying.
I'm here to talk to you today about how to cope with a dying person.
You know, at times a person may ingest something that wasn't supposed to be ingested, known as a poison.
Hi, I'm Captain Joe Bruni.
What we're going to talk about is the steps to take if someone ingests some type of poison.
The first thing to determine is what type of product or poison was ingested.
Was it plant, was it food, or was it some type of drug?

There are a dozen or more hands on techniques that we can do
So physical therapists and chiropractors will do joint manipulations and mobilizations
If you go to the HipTrac website or Youtube channel you'll see some demonstrations of these techniques
You can go to the Youtube channel and you can see demonstrations of some of these techniques
Some of them are very relaxing, very gentle, very pain relieving
They are all very safe
Then there are ones that are a little less comfortable
Sometimes we have to stretch that joint that is already irritated
How, at a particular moment in time—our moment in time—are they limited
And how could we get beyond those limits
And philosophers aren’t in the business in my view of trying to sort of add some sort of knowledge to the knowledge that is given by physicists and art critics and linguists and anthropologists, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera
If you've ever flown on a plane, you may have noticed that it would feel better to pop your ears.

The biggest mistake people make when they start positioning their products or their services or their businesses, is to take a position that somebody else has already got.
Especially a competitor.
You know, it goes back to the old idea that customers only come from one of two place.
Selling a condo or coop apartment can be a great experience.
I'm Richard Blake in Clearwater Florida and I'm here to explain how to sell a condo or a coop apartment.
First thing you want to do is contact your local real estate agent and ask them what properties have sold in the last six months.
This will give you an idea of the current market value of your condo.
Generally you're going to want to use properties that are in that immediate community or in that immediate complex and if for what ever reason nothing has sold.
In the last six months.

Hi my name is Dr. Art Bowler and I am a psychologist in Manhattan New York City where I have my own private practice.
In this clip we are going to talk about how to deal with depression.
Depression is a very serious illness and it effects many many Americans and people across the globe.
Depression is evidenced by depressed moods for more than two weeks ever day, loss of energy, difficulty sleeping, appetite changes, loss of energy, thoughts of suicide.
trade labor unions didn’t allow Black workers to join
And because they couldn’t join unions, many Black workers couldn’t get manufacturing or trade work – which paid much better than service work
And because they couldn’t get these jobs, Black communities had more men out of work, higher rates of poverty, and more criminal behavior
Which then allowed the white workers and unions to justify their decision to not allow black workers into their union
The prevailing beliefs about race and racism ultimately reinforced themselves
This is what’s now known as racial formation theory, a theory formalized by modern sociologists Michael Omi and Howard Winant
Racial formation refers to the process through which social, political, and economic forces influence how a society defines racial categories – and how those racial categories in turn end up shaping those forces
Omi and Winant argue that the concept of race came about as a tool to justify and maintain the economic and political power held by those of European descent
Another modern look at these issues can be seen in the work of sociologist William Julius Wilson
My name is Julie Asti.
I'm a Certified Financial Planner with Asti Financial Management.
And today I'm going to talk about how to design a savings plan.
The first thing you want to do in trying to design a savings plan is to first create a working budget.
Because you want to make sure that after, as your income comes in and you've paid all of your fixed and your variable expenses that you have some money that you can actually dedicate to a savings plan.
So the first step is definitely going to be able to create a working budget that provides you with hopefully positive cash flow in which you can start a savings plan.
When you are looking into a savings plan, one of the things that you are going to need to ask yourself is what are you saving for.
This is financial adviser Patrick Munro discussing about what are the best mutual funds to invest in.
Mutual funds are a trillion dollar marketplace.
They're widely available to individuals that are in the accumulation phase of life.

I think, up until that time, there was not a whole lot of notoriety that was coming to the Friendship Nine
But, at the time, I was serving on the Cultural and Heritage Museum Board
And if you knew anything about the turn of the century, everybody was trying to decide, what was the biggest thing that happened in the previous century
DARREN HUSTON: Yeah, I mean the recession, or the great recession as they might call it, has certainly hasn't stopped any of the transformation that was going on in technology.
But I think for many of us, it exposed maybe a lot of issues that were happening underneath the water.
This is Patrick Munro talking about the best way to invest money.
Very first one we have is Drama Queen
Drama queen is used especially for a woman who is extremely melodramatic
Like for a situation or for an event the way this woman would react will be in a very exaggerated and melodramatic way
Like for example, a friend of mine lost her wallet
And this another friend of mine was like "Oh no, Really

Now that's quite and exaggerated reaction, right

What books are you currently reading

so I definitely recommend to check them out

I didn't want anyone to know
It was a huge secret and I didn't tell anyone: my friends, family members, i did not want anyone to know
Disney, but from all over the place-what we hear in the radio
So for those of us in the theatres, watching Frozen for the first time, again, we see this build-up happening
And we were probably subconsciously just expecting "Let it Go



Welcome to the Monday Morning Brief for February 6, 2017
The Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Committee is down to 11 members
Henry Louis Gates Jr
has left after serving the maximum 12 years allowed on the panel
In an interview with Linn’s Washington Correspondent Bill McAllister, Gates said he would have never resigned from the panel, adding that it was his favorite one to serve on
In addition to being a noted Harvard professor of African and African-American research, Gates is a literary scholar, journalist, author, filmmaker
His documentaries include Finding Your Roots, which currently airs on PBS
The roots of the Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Committee are believed to date back to the 1940s
Many have suggested that it was the 1948 3¢ Poultry Industrial Chicken stamp — which has long been widely regarded as one of the least-necessary U

commemorative stamps ever — and other similar special-interest stamps that led to a call for a group to oversee the selection of topics to be honored on our postage
Whatever the impetus, it was almost a decade before the Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Committee was established by Postmaster General Arthur E
Summerfield in March of 1957
The announcement at the time said that the group “shall advise the Post Office Department on any matters pertaining to the subject matter, design, production and issuance of postage stamps
” The role of the committee hasn’t changed much
On its website today, the United States Postal Service says, “The group selects subjects for recommendation as future stamp issues, made with all postal customers in mind, including stamp collectors
” Also, as in 1957, the postmaster general is the one who appoints new committee members
These members come from many different fields, the Postal Service specifically states that they “provide expertise on history, science and technology, art, education, sports, and other subjects of public interest
” The stamp hobby is represented as well
The committee is currently chaired by Janet Klug, a lifelong collector, a former president of the American Philatelic Society and a Linn’s columnist
Another prominent collector and the former chief curator of philately for the Smithsonian National Postal Museum, Cheryl Ganz, also serves on the committee
As Bill McAllister points out in his report about Gates’ departure from the committee, its deliberations are kept secret
However, McAllister said that Gates told him in an interview that the panel has approved all his suggestions for stamps celebrating the contributions of African-Americans to the United States
These include the three most recent stamps in the Black Heritage series
They honori architect Robert Robinson Taylor; Bishop Richard Allen, founder of the African Methodist Episcopal Church; and most recently civil rights leader and activist Dorothy Height
She was honored on a stamp just issued February 1, the first day of Black History Month
Gates also told McAllister that an upcoming set of stamps will commemorate key players in the Harlem Renaissance, an early 20th-century cultural, artistic and social explosion
Gates himself has been pictured on a postage stamp, part of a pane of six issued by Ghana in 1998 paying tribute to Great Black Writers of the 20th Century

The first time I approached the person that I was thinking about as an investor, he told me that he didn't see me as an entrepreneur, as a CEO of this company, because I have lots of things to do.
I have my own startup.
I have my two other things to do.
I'm very active on social media.

Over the years, both the Duke and his younger brother Prince Harry have become more vocal about their mother's death
Earlier this year, during a visit to the Child Bereavement UK Centre in London, William comforted a grieving girl, Aoife, nine, who had lost her dad
"Do you know what happened to me
You know I lost my mummy when I was very young," said the Prince
"I was 15 and my brother was 12
So we lost our mummy when we were young as well
Do you speak about your daddy
Hi, I'm Carmen Lynne with Expert Village and I'm going to be talking to you today about handwriting analysis, or the posh word for that is graphology.
What handwriting analysis is, it's the study of what you do when you are writing in cursive script.

Liz Wahl: Last night RT made international headlines when one of our anchors went on the record and said the Russian intervention in Crimea is wrong.
And, indeed, as a reporter on this network, I face many ethical and moral challenges - especially me personally - coming from a family whose grandparents came here as refugees during the Hungarian revolution, ironically, to escape the Soviet forces.
I have family on my opposite side, on my mother's side, that sees the daily grind of poverty, and I'm very lucky to have grown up here in the United States.
I'm the daughter of a veteran.
FEMALE NARRATOR: A Title: Explanations

DEE: When he was about eight

We had always, our vacations consisted of going to grandpa and grandma's But when he was eight we were taking him to the Gulf of Mexico and to a whole brand new place that he never been before
And the first afternoon he got in the car, he was hunky dory - travel, travel, travel
Three hours into the ride he starts getting fussy
Then we get out
We eat some dinner and he absolutely refuses to get back in the car
And there is no way I'm going to physically makes this little boy, who is about the size of a five-year-old, get back in that car
Until I stopped and I said, "I don't know what's going on man
" And he didn't really have a communication system to communicate with us, other than his behavior at that moment in time
And I finally just looked said, "Look Jake, here's what we're doing
" And I went through and explain the best I could with what I had right there - that we're going to drive, then we're gonna stay in hotel, and we're gonna sleep and then we're going to get up and we're gonna drive some more and they were going to go see new things
And he hopped right in that seat for me and let me buckle him in
And that to me was like, oh my gosh, I really need to take time to explain everything we're doing, why we're doing it before we leave the house
My other two children just got it
If I said, "Hey, we're gonna go do this
" They just got it
But Jake didn't hear and process and see that we had bags packs in the living room for days before we got on that trip and went to you know the Gulf of Mexico
The other two started asking questions
"Hey, what's up with all the suit cases?" When we would sit down at dinner we talk about, ok, first we are going to pray, then we are going to eat, then this is what we are going to do after dinner to to help him have the vision of, that there is a structure to our day, that there are things that we've gotta take care of that involve all of us
All those things add up to the fact that we’re not getting as much sunshine so we’re not getting as much natural vitamin D produce in our bodies so this is the good time of year to either start supplementing with vitamin D or to increase your vitamin D supplement
The RDA was recently increase by the US government from 400 IU to 600 IU and a lot of health experts still think that that’s pretty low
It’s the amount that you need to prevent a severe deficiency but it might not be enough for optimum health levels
And vitamin D is really really closely related with the hormone system with your body
Hi, it's Alex!
Today I want to talk about how to respond to people who are telling you that something that you want, something you want to do or achieve is impossible.
In the past, I talked about how believing that something is not possible can actually hinder your ability to make it happen.
I shared a story, which you can watch in the previous video if you haven't.
This one, though, I want to focus on talking to other people, so say you have some sort of goal, idea, or dream, something that you want to bring into the world, and let's say you're talking to someone about it.
And, you're like: "Hey," like, "I really want to see this happen!" And the other person says: "Oh, that's never going to happen." This is the kind of thing that I actually have happen a lot, because I'm pretty idealistic, and I'm pretty talkative and open about the goals that I have for what I want to bring into being in the world.
And I frequently hear people respond to me by saying: "Oh, that's never going to happen," or like, sometimes they'll be sort of sarcastic, or joke about it like: "Pffsh, good luck with that." You know, sort of, blowing me off.
And for years, I kind of, would just get frustrated when people would react in this way.
But I had this breakthrough.
It was like, I think it may have even been last year, it was very recently.
I was in a bakery, and I was talking to one of the employees in the bakery who I really like, and, I can't even remember what I was talking about, but I was like: "Hey," like "I really want to see this kind of thing happen." And the person said something like: "Oh, well that's never going to happen." And I don't know what inspired me in the moment, but I called them out in a very specific way, I said: "I don't agree that it's not going to happen." "I think it's possible, and furthermore," "I think that the belief that it's not going to happen" "is part of the mentality that's holding us back" "from making it happen." I kind of was like: "Wow, that actually came out of my mouth." But I said that, and the other person was just like, it just stopped them, and their whole face changed.
I was looking into upgrading my kitchen with Corian or granite countertops, but the prices are more amazing than the countertops.
What is the best alternative to granite countertops?
If you are willing to have a mosaic countertop, with fitted seams or pieces held together with grout and glue, you could have a granite countertop.
Why do you recommend that?
The cost of a granite countertop is proportional to the size of granite.
If you can use recycled or broken granite pieces to make your counters, the price of the project goes down.
and seeing them change just seeing how it touches every aspect of their lives in hearing from their parents "my kids says the R sound and the S sound and he's so much more confident he's talking more he's reading more he's doing more things" and it's like it's amazing to hear and it's a great feeling to have
I'm actually a speech pathologist i graduated from baylor university with my bachelor's degree from the older clinic setting and been practicing for about 15 years

If you find yourself with an upset stomach or any stomach pains, there are a few things that you can do to help relieve an upset stomach.
I'm Dan Carlson, I'm a nurse.
JOHN GERZEMA: Well, one of the things that we see in our data that consumers are looking for in their brands that's fundamentally different from last year is a strong emphasis on integrity.
So a brand with integrity means that it will deliver on its promises, that it will deliver real value for the customer.
Now just mix the caramel with the popcorn in really well
Once it's all mixed in, you are going to pop it into the oven for 45 minutes and stir it every 15 minutes
While that's baking in the oven, let's make our s'mores dip
This is a super simple, but yummy treat
So basically all you have to do is pour in a few chocolate chips into a little pan and then all you have to do is add some marshmallows on top of that and put it in the oven
So you want to make sure to preheat your oven to 450 degrees, then you can stick in your cute, little treats and let them sit in there for 7-9 minutes
I think what’s happening with advertisers and kind of melding entertainment with participatory experiences is that they want consumers to not just hear about something and then remember it at a later point in time, they want them to actively participate in the message when it’s being sent.
Anyone who is serious about their relationship with Jesus Christ, has to keep separate from ungodly people.
Most Christians are NOT doing this.
They associate with wicked people.
They have fellowship with ungodly people as if righteousness and unrighteousness could hold hands and have a party.

If you've ever had a cold, you'll notice that more mucous is produced in your throat and in your nose even.
Why is mucous produced when you have a cold?
because I was very excited and very proud of it at the time and I still of course am but when people would ask me, "What do you do
" and I say, "I'm a Youtuber," and they'd say, "Oh, really

" I'd say, "Charisma On Command," and they'd say, "Oh, cool," and I go, "Yup, it is cool

And that was because I wanted my success to speak for me
BOB FRIEDMAN: The question of advertising and how it is relevant and how it's used is changing very radically.
I'm not even so sure that the name advertising is really not today a misnomer.
Hey Expo
(umm) Have you ever seen this movie shaggy dog? (uhh) Walt Disney (uhh) it's (uhh) okay this movie
(umm) I saw it at the movie theater at the dollar theater luckily because I wasn't very impressed by it
I mean you know Tim Allen is pretty funny in it but the movie itself is so cheesy like it's just it's just (stutter) really cheesy and it says it's going to be a ruff day, get it? Ruff day
(umm) Like Tim Allen turns into this shaggy dog like he literally turns into this dog
He starts acting like a dog and it's just like, what? What are you doing? It's just really cheesy but, kids, you know, laugh over it and think it's really funny but, you know as an adult, it'd probably put you to sleep so if you are looking on to stay up with your kids like, don't run it because or don't buy it because it's much like dogs laugh
but it's just kinda cheesy so I'm going to just give it two out of five star rating a two so you know take that into consideration
I'm going to do a movie review on Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End
(umm) This movie is currently still playing in the theaters, and (umm) I just recently watched it
(umm) I waited a while for (uhh) everybody to you know, because people wanted to see it as soon as it came out
I waited a while for it to die down before I went and saw it because I figured (uhh) since this is the the (stutter) the third installment you know, usually it comes into third movies, which, (umm) I've already done reviews on some third installment movies and, and they kind of sometimes lack
But when it comes to Pirates of the Caribbean the second one I didn't like
The first one I liked a lot
The second movie kind of died off for me the way they, they killed Jack Sparrow
And this movie starring the same characters, (uhh) (uhh) and Johnny Depp, (umm) Orlando Bloom and (uhh) Keira Knightley I believe (umm) for the names of the actors
(umm) It's a long movie, it's like two and a half hours maybe almost two to forty-five minutes
So and it has a lot of action in the movie
It (stutter) did kind of almost too much action, it, I think it numbs you after a while because it's got so much going on
And (umm) you know, the the (stutter) kind of back and forth plot goes here, it goes there goes all over the place, there's a lot of things going on so if you're not paying attention you're gonna kind of, kind of get lost in it
And so
But the, (stutter) but you know they did pretty good on the graphics
(umm) The CG is great
And (umm) the story's, you know, it, it keeps you out, oh I kind of wish they would of, of (stutter) maybe split this movie up or shortened it or something
Because this it's just, it's (stutter) almost just too much
They try to cram everything all in at once and it, it just didn't it just didn't (stutter) cut it for me
(umm) There's some parts I liked, some parts I didn't, so if I was to grade it I'd probably give it a C plus
(umm) I know the critics didn't give it a very good grade
But you know
Hi, My name is Nalin and I will be reviewing for you Stephen King's IT
So I'll take a closer look
So this is a movie about the (uhh) a clown basically as you can see on the DVD cover right here and (umm) this clown is (uhh) out to get children and (uhh) that that (stutter) is the basic plot of this movie and this movie starts out
I'm not even sure whether this is a movie or what but (uhh) this movie starts out in a town, in a small town and (uhh) it shows this clown that's been (uhh) really wicked clown and (umm) he takes under from farms and seven kids get together in (stutter) their childhood and (umm) then they want to reunite because this clown is bad
So the basic thing about (uhh) naming this thing IT, the movie, is that the clown, they named the clown as IT
I'll be reviewing (uhh) the movie Spider-Man Three which is currently in the theaters, which is the third and looked like the final, you know, these the Spider-Man trilogy but there might be more made with different actors or even a different director, it's hard to say
And you know I was pretty, I was looking forward to this movie you know quite a bit
(umm) You know I was a big fan of the first so that they were done pretty well, you know, with Sam Raimi directing it's pretty much, you know, the perfect choice, you know, for the, for the (stutter) movies in that, you know, he didn't take them too seriously, you know he knew how to joke around with the makeup, kind of, you know, goofy and kind of like booky and that kind of thing and it really worked for the (uhh) first two
I mean they always had good villains with like Alfred Molina playing (umm) Doctor Octopus and, you know, (umm) that kind of thing
(umm) But for some reason the third one really fell apart
(uhh) They had too many villains and it was just really hokey and it felt like they were just trying to do way, I mean, really it felt like it was two movies they tried to cram into one and (uhh) they didn't give enough time to relay anything
(uhh) I mean Peter Parker's character, you know, was (uhh) even, you know, when controlled by the symbiote (umm) it's just (uhh) it's just kind of a big mess
I just really left the theater feeling just kind of (uhh)
And the more and more I thought about it, the more and more I just really hated the movie
It's just, it's a bad movie (uhh), you know? With bad characterizations
The acting surprisingly enough was actually worse than the first two which is really saying something, you know, it's probably the definitely the weakest point of the first two movies
And (umm) it's just a big puddle of, you know, mess
Even the action sequences aren't as good as (uhh) the first and the second one so I gotta say it purp (stutter), I will, don't know if I say it ruined the trilogy
Well, it ruined the trilogy, I don't know if it ruined the first two movies for me
Hi, I am doing my video premium for Wolf's Rain - Recollections
This is the fourth DVD in the series i'm xxx but completely unnecessary
It contains four episodes and each episode is it focuses on one of the four main characters retelling what's happen so far in the story from their perspectives
The (uhh) video, the animation in the episode most of like most like (stutter) almost all if not all is rehashed in this animation is just (uhh) taken out from the previous episodes so they didn't even make the original animations because they are retelling the story that's already happened so they are just reusing all that animation
The audio is new but it doesn't tell you very much
It's just (uhh) pretty obvious stuff you know
They're basically saying this happened and this happened
It seems like they made this DVD just to fill a gap (uhh) during the time where they couldn't make new episodes I guess I don't know but it's (uhh) pretty upsetting but this DVD costs the same price as all the other DVDs in this series when it has nothing new
So, if you're a die hard fan and you wanna xxx and if you just want to watch everything in Wolf's Rain Wolf's Rain (stutter) (uhh) then you can get it but I wouldn't recommend it
It's (uhh) you know just get three then go on to five
Hi, Summer Banks here and today I'm reviewing for you, the DVD Vanilla Sky with Tom Cruise
Tom Cruise is in this movie with Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz
The movies is rated R for sexuality and strong language and is brought to you by Paramount pictures
Now I have to let you know I'm giving this movie two stars
The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because I've watched it approximately five times and I still have absolutely zero idea what really happened
This is a thriller
There are events that take place that you don't know if they're real, if they're not real
There are finales that aren't really finales
There are beginnings and events that aren't really there
There's some that are there that you don't see til later on
I I (stutter) cannot explain this movie in any way shape or form because I simply did not understand it
Now as for the shooting and the acting, it was fantastic
The movie was acted very well and I was very comfortable in that regard but, the simple story line was too difficult for me to follow
So, as I said, Vanilla Sky is receiving two stars from me and that's pushing it
It's probably more like one and a half
This is a review of the movie Spider-Man three
(umm) What a way to end the trilogy
Let's see the first Spider-Man film was pretty good, half of it was at least
The second one was silly and this one was worse
Not only was it excessively long and had way too many characters in it, (stutter) Spider-Man three just lacked substance on all levels I would say
Tobey Maguire (stutter) clearly didn't want to be doing this role anymore
Kirsten Dunst I don't know if she could ever act
She couldn't at the very least she wasn't acting in this film
(uhh) The direction, it was Sam Raimi, I I (stutter) just don't understand
I guess something happened
Like he used to be at least an interesting director what what (stutter) with like you know, the Evil Dead trilogy
But, I mean, then again those were very campy films
This is summer blockbuster so I don't know, maybe his artistic talent maybe just doesn't translate
But anyway (umm) plot was hopelessly absurd (umm) and uninteresting to boot and yeah
I I (stutter) don't even know why they introduced Venom
He showed up and then bam, he was gone
Hopefully I didn't spoil it for anybody
Anyways, for the positives about this film (umm) Stan Lee does another cameo, which was a little bit funny
This is a review of the movie Hostel Part two
(uhh) Well, what to say about this film
Surely, surely (stutter) wasn't hostile
Hostel was, it wasn't scary, but it was gruesome and kind of had some dark humor to it and a fairly interesting plot
(umm) Hostel two pretty much rehashed the plot of one except it made it about women
(uhh) going to the infamous hostel which leads to their demise, ultimately to their demise
But (umm) Yeah, I was I just felt it was very rehashed
It It's (stutter) been done already
The violence in this film was exponentially worse I would say
Not exponentially no, probably geometrically though
It was worse, but at the same time it was very forced, almost pornographic is a term that's thrown around a lot that I agree with
It's an accurate description
And (uhh) I didn't care about any of the characters in this film unlike the protagonist from the first one so
This review is for the movie Dead Silence
I got this movie because (uhh) I like horror movies every now and then and it says from the writer and director of Saw
I really liked Saw, I thought Saw was a pretty interesting original movie so I thought this would be good too
(uhh) but I was very disappointed by this movie
There, it's just it's (stutter) there's a lot of stuff that doesn't make any sense and a lot of stuff that just seems to be there just for the the (stutter) sake of the story like wouldn't happen otherwise
I mean I understand in movies that you have to suspend, you know disbelief for the sake of the story but when it, when it (stutter) there is nothing on it to hold on to, then it kind of truth or reality then it kind of just becomes nothing you know, waste of time
That's kind of what this movie became
And (uhh) as I was watching the extended features, they were talking about how great the sets were, how you know how, how (stutter) all the stuff they did was incredible and and I think they put more emphasis on the look of the movie rather than the actual movie itself and story line and everything else
And another thing that I I (stutter) kind of realize why the movie wasn't that great cause it kind of didn't, really not make any sense to me
It really seem like it was going all over
And it had an alternate ending and when I watched it, I kinda realized now the, the (stutter) actual, alternate ending kinda, could have made the movie go into two different directions and because they had two endings in mind, I think that they didn't really get a grasp on the actually theme of the story, what it should be from start to finish
(umm) Like the great xxx said, if you have more than one ending for a story, you're in trouble and I think that holds true with this
I wouldn't recommend it, there's really not anything scary in it
They try to have little scary moments that you have seen in every other horror movie, you know, knock offs of of (stutter) the kind of scare tactics that other movies have used and they don't even do a good job with that
So I didn't find this movie scary
License to Wed
I was, I was (stutter) really excited to see this movie
(umm) I'm a huge fan of The Office and Jim was in it so I I (stutter) was definitely on board to see the movie
And (umm) it's also got Robin Williams in it who's hilarious
Mandy Moore, she's really good in in (stutter) the few movies I've seen her in, but back to this movie
(umm) Let let's (stutter) go over the gist of the movie
Gist of the movie is Mandy Moore and Jim, I don't know his real name, (umm) I'll just call him Jim for
{clears throat} Are are (stutter) getting married but in order to get married at a certain church they have to pass the (umm) reverend's (stutter) marriage test that's to prove they're compatible
And (umm) they have three weeks to do it in
And and (stutter) (umm) Robin Williams is the pastor and he he (stutter) puts them through tests
And (umm) I didn't enjoy the movie, I I (stutter) really didn't, and I really wanted to
Maybe it was because I had too much high hopes and (umm) I think Jim was okay in it, Robin Williams wasn't his normal funny self to me
I don't know, maybe I'm getting tired of him, but I mean, he wasn't all that funny
The funniest person in the whole movie is (umm) the little kid in the movie
And (umm) I have no idea what his name is, but (umm) he's in some new movie coming out, I've seen him in it, he was on Jay Leno the other night
He was hilarious in the movie and (umm) the the (stutter) rest of the movie, you know, (hmm) it could me just going into the movie thinking it's going to be too good but, I mean there were a couple funny parts but it just seemed like (uhh) like (stutter) they were trying to be funny
Funnier, more than being funny
And (umm) I'll say on a scale of one to ten it's maybe a four
Maybe a four
Hello, my name is Mike and today I am going to be talking to you about the movie License to Wed
This is that new movie starring (umm) Robin Williams
Basic premise of the movie, this couple gets engaged, wants to go and get married at horrible church but the new standards there require that the priest approve the wedding beforehand and the priest makes them go through all kinds of crazy stuff to get his approval
Okay {sigh} so when you look at this movie, Robin Williams can actually be a reasonably funny guy but for him to be really funny in a movie isn't enough
For it to be a good movie itself has to be funny, you can't just rely on the fact that he's a funny guy and that's what this movie does
The humor in the movie is just horrible, the plot is not that good or well rounded
It just kinda feels like someone slapped it together and in the end you know having a big name comedian doesn't save you in the end
So, License to Wed starring Robin Williams, one out of five
You may be funny on your own but you weren't funny enough in this movie
This movie is an avoider
This is Dustin with a video review for a DVD and today we're looking at Coach Carter
This is an MTV production DVD and it's starring Samuel Jackson
As you can see there he's the little dude holding, well, kicking the basketball or whatever you wanna say
Basically he is a coach of a basketball team and there's all these kids that are like, troubled you know
They come from like, bad homes (uhh) bad families (uhh) bad friends
(uhh) Lots of drugs, gang things like that
You get the story
(umm) Basically he teaches them that, you know, there's more to life than all these bad things and everything
(umm) Overall I didn't like this movie very much at all actually
(umm) I would have to give this movie a two out of five
Very (umm) I don't know, stereotypical I I (stutter) feel
(umm) I feel that you would just waste your time if you watch this movie, so I would recommend not doing it
This is Dustin with a video review of A Cinderella Story, starring Hilary Duff, as you can see on this dudes back here
(uhh) That's basically the best part of this movie is that it does feature Hilary Duff because she's pretty hot
(uhh) But other than that, I mean this movie is (umm) {fart noise} not good at all
(uhh) It's It's (stutter) like they try to make the story of Cinderella, the classic fairy tale, (uhh) into a modern day LA type story and basically, this girl, she she works like manual labor and all this and stuff and she has an email buddy and he ends up asking her to go to the dance with her
It ends up that this email buddy is like the coolest dude out there and stuff
So she starts freaking out and basically you know, they get together they go to the dance
Aww it's all perfect and all that
(umm) I would give this movie a two out of five
It's completely a chick flick
I mean if you're a chick, maybe a four out of five, maybe
This is Dustin with a video review of the DVD called Legally Blonde
Its starring Reese Witherspoon and basically this movie is about this girl who falls in love with this guy and basically thinks she need to go to law school to get him and of course, she goes to Harvard and (umm) as you can see, she doesn't really fit in by the cover
I mean she wears pink and dresses in stiletto shoes and everything and you know and that's not really the whole college scenes anyways
But basically it's about like you know, girl power and this stuff and like how blondes rule and all this and how everything goes her way because she's pretty
(uhh) This movie is, I would give it a one out of five, it is garbage
(umm) They say two thumbs up (umm) they're lying
On the back they say a feel good girl power comedy
Corbitt here reviewing Hostel: Part two
Hostel: Part two is currently in theaters and it is directed by Eli Roth who also directed Hostel one and Cabin Fever
Hostel: Part two is a very gruesome movie
(umm) that is basically about a online type site where people pay to go to these foreign countries and basically kill tourists for money
(umm) Basically it's very gruesome
I wouldn't say it's the best movie
If you're a fan of the original Hostel, you might wanna check it out
But (uhh) I'd actually think that it's worse than the first one
Like I said, it's very gruesome and really that's the only thing the director tried to do is basically (uhh) make people squirm in their seats because of how gruesome it is and if you're looking for that kind of movie you might enjoy it
But (uhh) overall I'm not really happy with it
(uhh) I definitely don't think it's worth a movie (uhh) ticket
Spending all that money to go to the movies especially if you're going with someone else
But (umm) if you have a chance to see it, check it out
But (uhh) overall I wouldn't really recommend it
Hello
(umm) I am reviewing Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
It is the fifth movie in the series and {noise} it is it's (stutter) probably one of the darker movies in the series, doesn't end on an happy note
He's back! (umm) Yeah and in this, I was very disappointed with this film (umm), I'm a pretty big Harry Potter fan and I enjoyed the fourth movie pretty, yeah I enjoyed the fourth movie, (umm) but this movie, I would have to give it ten fingers down
Yeah So, pretty much this movie fails on all levels
Emma Watson cannot act
Rupert Grint who is probably only one of the good actors in the series
(umm) He plays a lesser role
The special effects aren't that great like the scene where they are flying on broom sticks towards (uhh) the order headquarters
You can tell it was shot from a flying vehicle over the water and not as someone following the flyers
(umm) If you haven't read the books, it will probably be really confusing since the director tried to cram everything in there
I thought the Umbridge actress was pretty good, she was a bitch which is what I wanted (umm) but, the movie, it tried putting random scares for no reason and the special effects were alright but with the budget this film had and how high my expectations were, this film is very horrible
I would not recommend it
I would recommend instead you read the book
This is Chobits disc three, Darkness Descends
(uhh) This is the third disc in the three disc Chobits collection and this one has chapter nine through twelve
(uhh) Each of them have four chapters on a disc
(uhh) Hideki, beside himself with joy, is going on a date with Yumi
(uhh) Basically this is an anime movie
If it's not your kind of thing, then I didn't really like it, but I don't like anime
(uhh) I've also heard from people who do enjoy it, this is by far the worst of the three
So definitely, if you really like the first two, maybe you should check this out
But I've heard it's really not very good
(uhh) I definitely didn't enjoy it, as somebody who's not into anime
But if that's your thing, then I guess you could try it out
(uhh) I would definitely say if you do think you'd be interested in this, that you should rent it before you buy it, because personally I think it would be a waste of fifteen dollars
I'm doing a review for Evan Almighty which is a movie currently in theaters starring Steve Carrell, Morgan Freeman and Lauren Graham
And it's about a modern day (uhh) Noah's Ark story and as as (stutter) and as you can imagine there's if you try to put the Noah's Ark story in modern times, there's gonna be some wacky hijinks that follow and obviously there are as (uhh) Steve Carrell becomes (uhh) Noah both in physical appearance and in his (uhh) duty to (uhh) build a huge ark in the middle of a populated American town, so
(umm) Morgan Freeman plays God, as he did in the Bruce Almighty movie
(umm) I like Morgan Freeman a lot, I don't think these roles give him much to do but it's good seeing him and he he (stutter) plays a pretty convincing God
(umm) Wasn't a big of this movie
This is a review for a movie currently in theaters called License to Wed, starring Robin Williams, John Krasinski and Mandy Moore
It's about a young couple who are getting ready to wed but before they are allowed to do so in the church (uhh) the priest, played by Robin Williams, requires that they go through his (uhh) training classes for (uhh) to make sure they're ready for marriage
(umm) I primarily went to this movie because I'm a big fan of The Office and I like (uhh) John Krasinski's work on on (stutter) that show
I'm not a big fan of Robin Williams at all
I find him (uhh) pretty annoying to be honest
So I was hoping that (uhh) John Krasinski would balance out my dislike for Robin Williams and (uhh) Mandy Moore's an attractive lady so that was a plus
I'm no you know fan of her acting or anything so I was kind of indifferent towards her
But the movie itself was alright
It had a couple of funny scenes and a couple of funny lines but it wasn't it wasn't really worth going to
I didn't (uhh) Robin Williams was grating as usual
Hello, (umm) Sarah here talking about Spider-Man Three, one of the first of several extensions of trilogies or other series of the summer
And (umm) basically the beginning of the end of original entertainment
And (umm) I think this movie was a perfect representation of that
It was satisfying in the laziest way, it was (umm) just basically the minimum that you might expect from an action movie
The fight scenes were weak, the characters were completely underdeveloped, (umm) basically the story was all over the place and everything that was interesting about it was barely touched on at all and it just seemed like they put almost no effort into making it because they knew that because it was a trilogy and a successful series that they didn't have to actually try to get people to go to the theaters
And it did break the box office records
And (umm) I think that's pretty pathetic, I mean maybe it's just trying, I mean it says that more and more people are going to the movies and less and less people actually care about what they're watching and taking in
I just saw Pirates of the Caribbean Three (uhh) At World's End and (uhh) I was a bit disappointed
I thought that movie was terrible actually
It was probably the worst out of all three, and the second one wasn't that great either
(uhh) First of all it was way too long, two and a half hours
It was just boring and there's too much story to it, not enough action, like I would get up and leave just cause it was so bad and yeah
I did not like it at all
Had some really good actors in it but (uhh) still Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom and Kira Knightley don't really do it for me
(uhh) The action scenes in that movie stunk, the story of that movie was pretty bad too
(umm) Also the ending of that movie sucked too
Also like the second one, just kind of left you there like (uhh), what happens? So you definitely know they're going to make a fourth one but (uhh) I don't like that kind of thing and (uhh) I think Pirates of the Caribbean has gone on way too long and they should probably stop making it after this next movie or just stop in the middle of making the next movie and realize that their movies suck
This review is on the (umm) The English movie, I'll Be There
(umm) I wasn't too impressed
This is, I didn't even watch the whole thing to be honest with you
(umm) This is guy girl named guy named guy named (stutter) Craig Ferguson Charlotte Church
(stutter) I've seen Craig Ferguson before, (umm) but not not not (stutter), (uhh) Charlotte Church
It's about a girl who her dad was a rock star or is a rocks (stutter), was a rock star and she wants to sing as her career, his old assistant comes to help her
It's an English movie (umm) Don't really get the humor in it
Don't really know if it's a humorous movie or a serious movie, I can't really tell
(umm) This is the widescreen version
It's rated PG-thirteen
(umm) If I remember, it was actually going to, I didn't watch the whole thing, but it was going to be fairly long
(umm) Not impressed
Would not going to give this one a very good rating (umm) It's okay
It's borderline okay, it's kind of bad, actually almost
Hey, you all
How's it going? My name is Jordan, and I'm going to be reviewing a movie today
And that movie is called Crank
Now (umm) I don't know about you all, but I have seen tons and tons of advertisements for this movie
And when I saw the advertisements, it looked like a really action-packed kind of (uhh) suspenseful movie that I thought I was really going to enjoy
However, I got into the theater, and I started watching the movie and everything, and everything was extremely cheesy
(uhh) Basically, it's about this guy who gets injected with this kind of serum or something that makes it so he cannot let his heartbeat drop below a certain rate and, or he'll die
So, basically, the entire movie, he's trying to keep his heartbeat up while trying to, you know, get back at the people who did this to him, say goodbye to his girlfriend, you know, tell the people that he, that he knows that he's dying and things like that
But (umm) a lot of the movie didn't really make sense
There was a lot of plot holes
I wouldn't really recommend it if you're kind of (uhh) if you like to think about things and, you know, if if (stutter) you're looking for just sheer blow-up stuff and, you know, things going fast and things blowing up, then I would definitely recommend seeing this movie
However, if you're looking for a sophisticated action movie that make sense, then I would not recommend this
(umm) The acting is only so-so
I didn't really care for the main actor
I never really cared for any of his movies
They all seem the same to me
(uhh) But (umm) but (stutter) overall, I was not very happy with this movie
I would not recommend it for people to go out and see it
I kind of wish I wouldn't have seen it, because the previews were better than the actual movie
The previews showed the best parts of the movie
The previews showed the biggest action part of the movie
And so (umm) I wouldn't really recommend it
So if you're looking for a good action movie, try to go see something else because this one is just not worth it
So definitely stay away from Crank
But (umm) that sounds kind of funny, but the movie, stay away from Crank, the movie
My old roommate back in college, (uhh) in an attempt to share common and bond with me would sometimes give me, you know, (umm) box sets of anime that he especially enjoyed and I've hung onto them over the years because I can't throw things away and one of said animes, you have to say it like an angry samurai ANIME, is (uhh) Ranma One Half

You just, you just (stutter) had Anma One Half, now you have Ranma
And the plot of this delightful little anime is that, oh I watched this, it's just been a few years
(umm) Whatever
Their jacket thing sucks
He's a dude when he gets splashed with cold or hot water, I forget which one temperature of water, turns into a hot girl
Hijinks ensue
Also there's like seven-thousand love interests and the girl that he's obviously courting (stutter) in traditional Japanese style is a complete and utter not a good person
She (umm), you know, blames him for things that aren't his fault and always catches him in compromising situations and I really think that Japanese cartoons at least, I can't say about TV, but Japanese cartoons are like ten, fifteen years behind (umm) my own obviously superior country's TV
(uhh) Just because we stopped relying as much on the old sitcom formula of girlfriend finds guy doing something that could look bad and of course they never talk it out and they always assume the worst and (stutter) oh man it drives me crazy
And this is like four seasons or something of that, every episode and it's just no good
(uhh) It has a really ridiculously catchy poppy bubblegum pop theme though
&gt;&gt; Well, hello from Davos again.
Hi, I'm Carolyn
Today I'm reviewing the DVD Dune
Dune is quite an interesting DVD
As it says on the front, A place beyond your dreams
A movie beyond your imagination
It's definitely way beyond my imagination
And the beginning started out really pretty good and then it just got kind of too crazy, with this weird music that was, like, super electric guitar or something, but it just got a little bit crazy
So it is like science fiction
It is rated PG-thirteen for language and (uhh) a little bit of (uhh) kissing in there
(umm) Let's see
It is Frank Herbert, classic science fiction epic was made into a movie
The director is if I can find it here for you, (uhh) David Lynch, who did The Elephant Man and Eraserhead
And basically, it's a story about (uhh) this intergalactic warrior
So you're out in space
It starts off being narrated by one of the (stutter) space princesses or whatever
(uhh) and (uhh) Paul is the messianic rise to leadership
So this guy named Paul, he's born of this woman who was only supposed to have daughters, but she has this son and he's supposed to, well, this other land that has this (umm) the spice, and this spice is what everybody wants in this intergalactic (uhh) you know, in this (umm) galaxy and this space (stutter) world
And so, (stutter) on this land, on this other planet where the spice is harvested, they know that (uhh) the messiah will come
So it's got a little religious undertones in it
And then it just goes kind of kookie and just keeps going on and on, with cool (uhh) special effects and (uhh) powerful performances and images
So it's a little over the top for me
(umm) It did win Best Supporting (stutter) Actress in nineteen eighty three and (uhh) it's a classic
So if you've never seen Dune {laughter} and you want an adventure {laughter}, then you could go out and get this movie
My review today is (umm) the movie Surf's Up
The animated movie about surfing penguins
(umm) This movie starts out as a very there's a very young penguin, he's wanting to break free from where his family is
He wants to go out and see the world and do some surfing
Along the way, before he before he (stutter) leaves town, this surf guy comes into his town and gives him a necklace
Basically getting him started into the surfing world
he he (stutter) in turn wants to go out and surf
And be a big surfing star
So he, I don't exactly know what, where exactly he goes, but he runs across this (uhh) this big surfer guy that's supposedly (uhh) dies, and he learns to surf, surfs really well, wins a competition
And everything turns out okay in the movie
This review is for a film currently in theaters called Spider-Man three
(umm) Hugely popular film
(umm) Big giant movie blockbuster trilogy
(umm) So this is where I stand with the Spider-Man movies
Actually I didn't like the first one
I thought it was kind of boring and hokey
(umm) Really enjoyed the second one a lot
I thought it was more mature
I thought it was deeper and had more of a message
(uhh) I really liked Doc Ock (umm) He was a great villain and I really enjoyed Spider-Man two and actually, (uhh) it made up for Spider-Man one and I really couldn't wait for the third one to come out
And so I go see Spider-Man three and once again I'm sorely disappointed
(umm) It's hokey, it's shallow, it's, it's not at all what you'd expect
Especially since (umm) they introduced Venom in it which had so many possibilities for it to be (umm) you know, another dark film, another more mature film
But (umm) Topher Grace from That seventies Show actually plays Venom, which I thought was a stupid choice
(umm) He makes a really terrible Venom
And they turn the movie just into just basically a big joke
(umm) You don't care at all for the characters, you don't care at all for the story line
It's really boring and (umm) I don't know, like I've forgotten most of the things in the film just because I didn't care about it that much
So I was sorely disappointed and (umm) I probably won't be go see the fourth Spider-Man because they completely lost me now
Hello, this review is for Star Wars The Empire Strikes back
This is my favorite of all the Star Wars movies
(umm) It's really dark kind of movie (umm) everything kind of starts going bad for the rebels, they get driven off their ice planet in the beginning
There's a giant battle right starting off, (umm) these giant walkers, the AT-ATs come, and they attack everything, and they blow up their base and the rebels have to run
And then Luke Skywalker goes to be trained as a jedi (uhh) and he meets Yoda, and Yoda teaches him all about the force and how to use it and how to become a true jedi, and not succumb to the power of the dark side
And then in the end he's forced to confront Vader
Vader traps his friends and and (stutter) lures him into a trap (umm) to try and take him to the emperor
(umm) Really intense movie, really cool
Billy Dee Williams comes and (uhh) makes his appearance as Lando Calrissian, of course Carrie Fisher is in it
Frank Oz does the voice of Yoda, who Frank Oz has of course done Muppet movies and voices for all sorts of people
It was really great
And Harrison Ford returns as Han Solo, and this is just (uhh) a really awesome movie
Check it out if you haven't seen it
Hello I'm Matthew and I'm here to tell you about this DVD Movie {cough} this is easy money starring Rodney Dangerfield (umm) he is a comedian actor (umm) that did comedy back in the eighties and nineties and recently passed away a few years ago
Hi, today I'm gonna (stutter) review the movie I recently saw in theater, it's Live Free or Die Hard
This is an action adventure thriller that was just, I mean there's no way you could be bored in this movie
I thought it was an excellent movie
It stars Bruce Willis, he plays the part of John McClane
This is the fourth in a series of shows
I had never seen the other shows, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one
It's (umm) rated PG-thirteen, it's a little over two hours long and it's basically about this old-fashioned cop who (umm) is used to doing things the hard way or the normal way as opposed to the younger generation who thinks everything has to be done through computers
But there's a young guy played by Justin Long, and if you can't recognize who he is, he's in the (umm) Mac and (umm) PC commercial
He plays the Mac and I kept thinking the whole movie you know, who is this guy
But that's who it is
He plays a young computer hacker who accidentally helps the (stutter) wrong people get some (umm) information and helps them try to destroy the US's (umm) whole computer system, everything going and John McClane comes to help you know, fix this problem and they work together and they solve it
It's a very high action movie and you know you could go along with most of it
They had some helicopters and some freeway scenes that were just, you know, a little bit outrageous at one point
But (umm) I mean as long as you're not expecting it to be totally realistic and you know you're in an action movie that's fine
It was an excellent movie, I'd give it (umm) five stars because I was not bored one minute
I was on the edge of my seat and I thought it was very entertaining
I'm holding Cheaper by the Dozen DVD set starring Steve Martin, Bonnie Hunt, Tom Welling, and Hillary Duff
(umm) This movie was put out in two-thousand-three and it was given to (umm) to me as a gift but but (stutter) you can purchase it at Walmart for fifteen dollars
(umm) This movie's okay, it's not my favorite
(umm) Steve Martin (uhh) and Bonny Hunt do a great a job acting, Steve Martin is hilarious as ever (umm) but it wasn't the best family movie in the world
There were some things in there that just didn't really stick with me, I I (stutter) kind of thought they should have left it out for a family movie
(umm) But (stutter) all the kids in the movie are great actors and great actresses, they really have a good cast, just think the writing could have been a little different
So if you're looking for, you know, a clean family film this isn't really it
(umm) It's rated PG
(umm) Again you can buy it at Walmart for fifteen dollars
(umm) I've also seen it at Target so you can buy it there for about the same price
So (umm) anyways, this is Cheaper by the Dozen
I'm holding the hilarious movie The Princess Diaries, starring Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews
This film tells the story of Mia Thermopolis who is a gawky and odd teenager who lives in San Francisco yet finds out that she is princess to the throne of Genovia, a European country
(umm) Julie Andrews stars as the queen and who comes and tells Mia the secret that was kept from her her (stutter) whole life
This movie was purchased at Walmart for fifteen dollars but you can also find it at Target or online at DisneyDVD dot com
(umm) This is a great movie
I think it's great for girls and I think it's great for teenagers
(umm) My brothers even watch this
So if my brothers watch it, you know it's a good movie
(umm) It is rated G and I give it five stars because I just think it's wonderful
So, highly recommend it
Alright this review is for Dead or Alive, the movie (umm) based off the video game
(umm) It's kind of like a, it's halfway of a parody, halfway serious movie
(umm) It doesn't it doesn't (stutter) try to be too serious but it also isn't a comedy or anything like that
(umm) It's a martial arts movie
(umm) Type of movie that basically stars (umm) four four four (stutter) of the people from the game
(umm) and they it's basically just an excuse to have martial arts and CG in a movie
(umm) Basically they just screw around (uhh) go around beating people up, getting in fights (umm) showing off, doing the ninja thing and then (uhh) there's a little bit of a plot thrown in
But it's not nothing believable
Not even very easy to follow
(umm) Yeah there's a lot of holes in the plot
(umm) Overall, I'd say it's probably not worth it to see this movie
(umm) I I (stutter) Yeah this is one of those movies where definitely video games should not be made in the (uhh) movies
Too hard to follow
Not they don't make great movies, not enough plot in them
(umm) So yeah, and the acting, overall, not very great
(umm) The fight scenes were all right
They're semi decent, but still (umm) nothing, nothing (stutter) good
(stutter) I probably wouldn't even rent this movie
Hey expo
(umm) I have a movie review for you today, and it's not very good
(uhh) The movie that I'm reviewing is Cashback
(umm) Not much to say about this movie, it had had (stutter) a pretty weak story line I think
(uhh) Characters were a little bit (umm) shaky
I don't know, it it (stutter) didn't seem like it, movie itself didn't seem like it was together too well
(umm) I don't know, it was a lot of just unnecessary things that just made it kind of played out and annoying
(umm) I wouldn't pay to see it again
(umm) Really wasn't that great
Not family movie (umm) as you might know it's rated R, so obviously it's probably not a family movie
(umm) But even if you're by yourself or with some friends or with anybody you probably still won't like it
It's not, I don't like it
It's not that good
But (umm) you might like it, I didn't
(uhh) One out of five maybe
Yeah, one out of five
(umm) So (umm) Cashback not too great, so go see it for yourself and see what you think (umm) but I'm going to give it one out of five
So there you have it
HI, I'm here to review (uhh) American Wedding DVD
(umm) This is the (umm) third movie in the (umm) American Pie series
(umm) It's about (umm) about Jason Biggs character (umm) Jim
He (umm) he decides to marry this girl (umm) Michelle who was in the (umm) the (uhh) very first movie and (umm) movie's definitely not as good as the (uhh) first one
(umm) Second one wasn't that great either
This one also doesn't really make the cut
(umm) It's just a lot of (umm) crude crude humor
(umm) I mean like I said, it's not a good movie
(umm) I definitely wouldn't suggest it for anyone
(umm) I don't know, I didn't really like it that much
(umm) I mean it does have it's (stutters) a few funny points, (umm) but they're scattered few and far between
So I mean I definitely wouldn't suggest this
It's definitely not a kids movie
Hi I'm here to review (uhh) Drumline DVD starring Nick Cannon
(umm) You may know him from (uhh) from All That when he was (uhh) when he was younger, and (uhh) now more recently he's been (uhh) starring in his own show on MTV called (uhh) Wild and Out
(umm) Nick Cannon is pretty funny guy but (um) you know when it comes to playing a serious role as this, (uhh) he's, he doesn't (uhh) doesn't really cut it very well
(umm) He's not a very good movie
(uhh) I mean it is good if you like watching the (um) the whole band and everything
(umm) Like whole black college (uhh) band battles
(uhh) But I mean, really the movie's only good for those scenes where they're actually doing their (uhh) their battling
The (uhh) the dialog isn't that great, the (uhh) storyline is is (stutter) pretty predictable, pretty cheesy you know
(uhh) So I mean I wouldn't suggest this unless you were just watching it just to watch the (uhh) the bands, but I mean you can do that any you know college football game
So all in all, don't get this (uhh) Drumline DVD
This DVD I have here is entitled the Italian Job
(umm) It's a very exciting film starring Charlize Theron and Edward Norton
(umm) I really loved it, it's kind of an action movie and usually I don't like action movies that much
There is a very exciting scene where they're all driving Minis, Mini Coopers, and there's a bunch of stuff in it and they're going through all these little alleyways and down stairs, places Minis wouldn't drive and it's really cool
The boys thought that car was cool so (umm) it's a great movie if you like that car
It's very exciting
(umm) {clears throat} I think there's been great reviews (stutter) about this movie and it's very (umm) fun to watch with friends and I have always had a fun time watching it
Hi, this is Dave and this is my review of The Matrix Revolutions
This is the third chapter, third and final chapter, in the Matrix trilogy and I would say by far my least favorite of the three
(uhh) The first movie, I thought was really good
I enjoyed it
(uhh) it was very original
The second movie, not so much
(uhh) It still had some redeeming qualities like I did enjoy the action sequences quite a bit
But story wise it was a big disappointment over the first one
And Matrix Revolutions, the third one, really gets even worse
(uhh) The action sequences I thought were didn't even hold up
They were completely unbelievable and over the top and just not really that fun to watch
(umm) The story got even worse I thought
It just I don't really know where they were going with it
(umm) But I would say if you've seen the first two movies already you might as well give it a watch just to finish up the trilogy and be done with it
But otherwise (umm) I really think you could pass on this and not be missing anything
{noise} Hi, I'm here to review the (umm) House Party DVD
(umm) I didn't really like this movie
(uhh) It's a old old-school movie
(umm) It's about (umm) this guy, Kid, he (uhh) he's played by Christopher Reid
{noise} He's basically a (umm) a nerdy kid, comes to (uhh) comes to live in this in a rough neighborhood and (uhh) he's trying to learn the ropes, trying to be cool
And (uhh) then he meets this guy, Play
And they become Kid and Play
And they (uhh) you know, try try (stutter) to make it up in the world
And they (uhh) try to throw a big house party, like have lots of fun and everything
And there's some people who (umm) who are trying, you know, like spoil their fun and everything
Of course, his father is over protective
Trying not to, trying to get (stutter) him focused on school and everything
And (umm) you know, it wasn't that that (stutter) funny of a movie
But (umm), like I said, I didn't really like it
Of course, it's a old movie, so that, that (stutter) could be it also
So, I mean, all in all I wouldn't suggest getting, getting (stutter) this DVD
It's definitely not worth the money
Hi, this is gonna be a review of the movie of I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry and this is one of those movie when I saw the trailer, I was all happy seeing to see that movie because it looks so hilarious in the trailer
Well, unfortunately all the funny parts were apparently in the trailer (umm) and I say that only because there were other funny parts in the movie but it was all those like obvious funny parts
(umm) It was the type of humor that would appeal to an eight year old boy but that's what I should expect from an Adam Sandler comedy
(umm) There were too many obvios jokes and I felt there was a lot of stereotypes
(umm) I felt it went from a lot of stereotypes to a lot of trying to force an after school special kind of movie on this (umm) and (umm) it just felt too unbelievable from going from stereotypes to trying to send a message so (umm) it, there were some funny jokes in there
I just felt like all the jokes were already used in the trailers so that was a little disappointing to me
It was a funny movie
(umm) It wasn't as funny as I had hoped it would be
(uhh) It's one of those movie that you should definitely, you would be better off when it come out in DVD though it definitely wasn't worth going to see it at the movie theater
This is Wild Wild West and it stars Will Smith, Kevin Kline and Selma Hayek
And while I'm actually usually a pretty big fan of (umm) Will Smith movies because I think he's, you know, he's a good actor
But (uhh) you know even he couldn't save this movie
(umm) This was (uhh) basically just not a good movie
I mean the plot was terrible
(uhh) A lot of the like you know a lot of the little gadgets that they through into the movie and you know were just bad ideas
(umm) I mean I guess it's entertaining to watch once or once you know like ever and (stutter) just to see how bad it was
But (umm) I mean (stutter) you think with actually a you know a somewhat decent cast that they pull off a you know, better movie but they don't
(umm) (uhh) Yeah (uhh) There's a whole bunch of special features
There's a you know behind the scenes documentaries, Will Smith and Enrique Eglasias (uhh) music videos, director commentary and you know they threw in a whole bunch of stuff but you know it doesn't really make the movie you know it doesn't make the movie any better
So I give this movie a two out of five
(umm) Like I said I'm a huge fan of Will Smith and (uhh) (stutter) basically everything he's been in, but (uhh) this is just (uhh) this wasn't a good movie
I'm gonna do a review on The (stutter) Best Little Whore House in Texas
Don't ask me why I got this, but I thought it would be (umm) fun because it has a character that plays Gomer Pyle in it, and Burt Reynolds, Dolly Parton, and I thought it would be a good movie
Don't get me wrong, it it it (stutter) has it's moments, but it's an older movie
(umm) I'm not sure when it was even made
(uhh) It says a release date
Anyways, I don't know (uhh) Pretty much it's it's (stutter) about this cop, and there's this whore house and they want to get it shut down and the cop is sleeping with the owner of the whore house and you know, she wants him to be on her side and he, it it's (stutter) an it's a weird movie and yeah it has funny moments and stuff but it just it just (stutter) doesn't keep me involved throughout the movie because I I (stutter)just know that I it's just weird and I'll probably won't watch this again and I can't recommend someone watch this because it's just, maybe for the (uhh) someone that's older than me that has seen it in the past or watched shows like that in the past
They they (stutter) might enjoy it but (umm) I, no, I didn't like it
(uhh) This is The Matrix Revolutions (umm) the third installment in the Wachowski brothers matrix trilogy, and definitely the worst
(uhh) I would give it probably two stars out of five
(uhh) I only bought this movie to complete the series
(umm) It goes way too heavy on the Jesus references
(umm) There's just Neo in there, trying to save the world again and stuff and just way too heavy on the Jesus references, I hated that
And what made the first two movies great was like, the kung fu and hand to hand action
And in this movie, it's all done with machines, and it's just not nearly as cool it it (stutter) gets rather stupid
And I I (stutter) just didn't get why they didn't stop after the second one
It (uhh) like the agents once again are multiplying, big surprise, and {sigh} it's just all these machines going on and (stutter) just not the human emotion that were, that was in the first two
Hi, this is my review of the movie The Chronicles of Riddick
(uhh) This movie I really bought just on a whim
I had seen the original movie starring Riddick (uhh) which is Pitch Black and I really enjoyed that movie so when this came out it looked like just a big epic movie featuring (uhh) the same characters
So I figured it'd probably be pretty good so I picked it up
(uhh) Visually, it's really (uhh) pretty incredible movie but the story was kind of a let down
It's kind of just an instantly forgettable action movie
(uhh) I wasn't that impressed with it and I probably would not have bought it if I had seen it before I picked it up
(umm) So I really can't recommend it although I did enjoy the previous movie, Pitch Black, which you might wanna check out
(umm) Yeah, so I would say for the most part, you can skip this
But (uhh) if you do wanna check it out, just keep in mind that (uhh) the original was rated R I believe and this is an unrated version which (uhh) would definitely be inappropriate for children
Alright (uhh) this is going to be a review of a foreign film Old Boy
This film comes (uhh) from Korea and it is highly regarded as (uhh) just a great film overall
(uhh) I'm not, I can't go into the plot or the storyline without giving anything away, without giving (stutter) any spoilers away, but I can set up the story
(uhh) Dae-Su is a Korean man who one day gets locked up in this hotel room
He is basically jailed for fifteen years and he doesn't know why
And the rest of the film involves him trying to find out why he got locked up, who did this to him, and he tries to see if he can exact revenge on the person who (uhh) who jailed him for fifteen years
(uhh) this a wonderful (uhh) masterpiece
If you're not into foreign films, you probably will be after watching this
(uhh) I recommend watching it in the dubbed, (uhh) not the dubbed but the subtitled version (uhh) just to get the the (stutter) entire effect, the entire feel of it
It is done great
(uhh) the actors are great, storyline is great
Hello, my name is Emma and today I'm going to review this DVD that I got
It is the Blair Witch Project Two, Book of Shadows, and Blair Witch Project One, I know a lot of people didn't really like it, but I thought it was pretty good
It scared me a little bit, which is rare with a scary movie
But this movie has absolutely nothing to do with The Blair Witch Project One
You know, none of the same actors, hardly even the same plot, and a lot of really, really random weird stuff that makes absolutely no sense like, you know, I wouldn't even be so angry about it if they had called it something different because it's clearly not The Blair Witch Project
I don't even think it was directed by the same person
I got this DVD at Best Buy for about (umm) twelve dollars I think
You know, I hadn't seen the movie yet
I like The Blair Witch Project, thought I'd like this too, but I didn't
It was awful
I would not recommend buying it
This is a review for Black Sheep, which came out this year in New Zealand
(umm) I only watch this movie online but I really thought this plot was kind of (umm) was very (uhh) not well thought out
(umm) It was basically about (umm) It was basically about (uhh) a man named Henry Oldfield and he returns home to his brother Angus Oldfield Oldfield(stutter), who is doing giant experiments on sheep
(umm) Henry Old Oldfield (stutter) was coming back from a psychiatric institute which (umm) was treating him because of his fear of sheeps
And (uhh) he came back to Angus and he found out that Angus had (umm) released a genetically engineered sheep that turned them into that turned the sheep into blood thirsty sheep
(umm) Basically it was just Henry's (umm) nightmare (uhh) came to life
Overall, (umm) it was just basically this movie was basically about how Henry Angus had to avoid these deadly sheep which (umm) this one sheep turned more thousands into blood thirsty sheeps
So basically they had to find a way to save New Zealand and avoid these sheep
(uhh) Personally I thought this movie, the plot was kind of lacking and it wasn't very fulfilling in my eyes
Hi, today I'd like to review Shark Tale on DVD, and this was another of the many animated movies
(umm) This one features voice actors such as Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Renee Zellweger, Angelina Jolie, Jack Black and even director Martin Scorsese
(umm) This was an entertaining enough movie
It it's got a pretty generic story about some fish and it (umm) features a real musical sequences to popular seventies songs
But overall I found it to be just kind if generic and it was just made to capitalize on the popularity of movies like Shrek or Toy Story
Plus it just used the voice acting cast to gain popularity even though it's kind of distracting in that you just kind of hear the celebrities but not the characters
(umm) DVD does have a good bit of special features (umm) that kids will enjoy like bloopers and interactive things about the music and the special effects and interviews with the cast
So (umm) overall I think I'd recommend this for kids cause I think they'd probably enjoy it, but otherwise (umm) I wouldn't recommend it because it's just pretty generic and lazy and not that interesting
Hi
This is a review for the (uhh) Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood
The catchphrase for this movie is mothers, daughters, the never ending story of good versus evil
I don't actually see how this applies to this movie
(umm) I didn't really find that this movie was very entertaining
(uhh) It lacked really any kind of (uhh) draw that some chick flicks might have for men
(umm) This movie's definitely just for girls and it (uhh), you know, you need to have a Kleenex box alongside with you
It does happen to have some very tragic and downright (umm) depressing moments in the movie, (uhh) especially with the fact that the mother and the daughter that are the main characters, Sandra Bullock and whatever her mom's name is, (umm) they (uhh) have this rift between them and the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, which is the sworn lifelong friends of Vivi, who is Sandra Bullock, (uhh) have decided to have this intervention so that they can bring mother and daughter back together
(uhh) It seems like an impossible task but of course because a chick flick it obviously works out
(umm) The title (uhh) obviously the sunflower that you see on the cover here is a little misleading cause the movie overall is rather depressing
My review now is for the movie Nancy Drew, by Andrew Fleming
Well, Andrew Fleming is the director, and yeah
So those who are of course childhood fans, I am as I suppose
I read the Nancy Drew books as a child, and yeah I thought they were really good
And when I heard there was a movie coming out I was skeptical, which is not too surprising
Movies from books are often, well, rushed
Of course, there are exceptions
Lord of the Rings, for one, and yeah
This one was hmm
I know Nancy Drew doesn't really make her appearance on the big screen quite as well as she does in the books
In the books she's a very interesting character, but yet on the big screen, yeah she loses it I feel and most of the magic was in the imagination, well that's what it seems to be because (stutter) I just couldn't get into this movie
Thought it was quite fast paced and yeah I just, I couldn't enjoy the movie
Which is sad because I was really looking forward to it
And the characters try their best to act, but yeah, xxx the story just (stutter) was missing something, that kind of Nancy Drew magic and well it kind of broke my heart
So if you also loved Nancy Drew as I did as a child then, well, you could try and watch this but be prepared for disappointment
Go in with low expectations and you might enjoy this
Hello ExpoTV, today I have another great (umm) review for a movie currently in theaters
Live Free or Die Hard and obviously this is starring Bruce Willis and of course I forget the rest of the characters I always forget names, but Live Free or Die Hard is exactly what it sounds like
It's a mantra for an action movie and if you love the rest of the Die Hards and you've seen them and you have Die Hard movie nights like I've had, you're gonna love it
It's basically the summer's action hit before Transformers came out
But Live Free or Die Hard basically if you're like me, if you love to see stuff blowing up, cars flipping in the air, shoot them up, everything like that, if it Bruce Willis is crazy and hardcore as usual, (umm) just like the rest of them, it definitely won't disappoint
(umm) It's definitely something that is worth the money you got, you've got (stutter) to see the rest of the Die Hards
I would definitely, I can't wait until it comes out on DVD and we get out the collection and have another movie night
(umm) It's a perfect edition, and basically if you love the rest of the Die Hards don't even hesitate, go out and see it
Hello Expo TV
Today I have another great movie for only in theater review for you and that is Nancy Drew
Nancy Drew, to be honest, I really didn't like at all
(umm) I took my younger brother and sister to go see it and they loved it so I guess it's more of a preteen (uhh) adolescent kid movie than for (umm) young adults and adults
(umm) I would say if you're babysitting and you wanna get the kids, they wanna see a movie xxx like that, Nancy Drew (umm) would be good for that
(umm) It's basically like the Nancy Drew books
The girl she's a detective and (umm) and she's really good
(umm) And I mean she's solving mysteries
She's a little bit of an oddball
She doesn't really fit in (umm) with the current times, the current kids
Which is kind of interesting
I though (umm) they kind of set her out as sort of like the books are Nancy Drew
(umm) She was kind of old fashioned and all the way she dressed and she is very conservative and compared to the newer kids and I thought that was an interesting contrast which the younger kids I don't think would pick up on
But (umm) really I mean you have as much depth as a kids movie has and I mean, it's basically you know a kid's spy series
So, I mean for younger kids I think it's great but for older audiences, I mean again it's a good family movie but (umm) definitely not a blockbuster hit
(uhh) The movie Derailed based on a book by James Sigel
(umm) I picked up because I really liked the book
However (umm) I should have known with Xzibit being one of the featured actors that the acting and the, the general dialogue was gonna be awful
(umm) Xzibit has failed to impress me with his acting ability as most rappers who attempt to (uhh) succeed in the movie industry tend to do
(umm) The first twenty minutes, half hour, work pretty well and then the movie just loses all coherence
(umm) If you're looking for a mindless thrill this may be it for you, however it is lacking a little on the thrill part and all the Hollywood cliches are here, everything from the fake ending (umm) to the way that the characters are portrayed
(umm) The acting's subpar, the screen the screenplay (stutter) is disappointing and the directing is awful
Hi, this is my movie review of the movie (umm) Twenty-Eight Weeks Later and (umm) first of all, I have to say, I saw the first movie, Twenty-Eight Days Later, and I thought it was actually quite intriguing despite being really nasty
(umm) I'm actually quite intrigued with the kind of like modern-day zombie movies
I've seen almost every one of them from the pretty good one to the mediocre one to the really really bad one
Basically, zombie movies, (umm) nowadays zombie movies are based on one concept
Now it doesn't matter if they call it differently, they're the same
They basically have some type of virus that they have and then they bite people and then they infect people and then they all have you know the walking dead I'm gonna bite people (umm) virus, and Twenty-Eight Days Later explored that (umm) and it was set in England and this movie's also set in in (stutter) the United Kingdom and it's basically that they sealed off after the first attack and (umm) America and the United Nations are opening up Great Britain, they're cleaning up the mess (umm) because they think all the zombies have died or has been fire bombed and exterminated, so they go (umm) try to bring, resettle Great Britain with the people who survived and people who escaped
And the story starts out with a family, and (umm) the father's reunited reunited (stutter) with (umm) the brother and the sister, and basically (umm) they're really shattered that you know their mom died
(umm) but one of the twist is that (umm) the movie is that they find the mom and (umm) that's where the story begins
(umm) I think I think (stutter) the movie was it's okay in terms of plot
I think the mom coming back and she's being really you know advertised in the trailers as (umm) being really important person, and she is a very important person (umm) in this movie
I think one of the things that kind of bothered me is that when they brought the character back, the way they did that was really annoying because they relied on the children (umm) the characters as being really idiotic
They relied on a lot of chance events that feels really like forced and feel very unrealistic
It's like you're looking at the movie, you're like, screaming at the movie like what the heck, like, that's so stupid, like no normal human with normal intelligence would do that, so it's like, when you, (stutter) there's certain parts, like in the beginning where you're just like how could they do that and it just feels so that like the film maker ran out of ideas so they used some cheap idea to, you know, create some drama to (stutter) bring the zombies into the film
Hi, this is my movie review of the movie, Sunshine and this is a movie that stars Cillian Murphy and (umm) Chris Evans as people who from the Earth (umm) who realize that the sun is dying and they are trying to send a payload to the sun to rejuice the sun
(umm) I think the movie has been a little bit overrated
(umm) I didn't like the movie at all
I think it wasn't as good as (umm) I don't think it's as good as like any science fiction movie
I don't think it's as good as those in space, you know movies, because I felt not only was the production really cheap, (umm) I I (stutter) just didn't really believe that you can have a whole spaceship full of people, never (umm) showing like you (stutter) no gravity scenes and that was, but that was not the majority of the problem though
The majority of the problem was the movie didn't really have a good plot (umm) as advertised as being cool you know and directed by the same person who did twenty-eight days later and you know, stars Cillian Murphy who's supposed to be a good acting
But you know what, doesn't matter all of those, it doesn't matter if movies look beautiful
I think what matters the most is the movie has a good plot, it has a feasible plot you know, it's got maybe like a message at the end that's not too cliche (umm) and the movie failed in every aspect in my opinion
I didn't think it was visually stunning
I didn't think the story was interesting
I didn't even, in the end of the movie, I was like {sigh} relieved that the movie was done you know
I couldn't wait to not watch the movie and (stutter)I mean I just wanted to fast forward and see what happens in the end
And in the end it was very predictable it was like, and there was, basically there were some parts of the movie where they questioned like you know (stutter) how mentally you know ill the people on board the (umm) spacecraft and you know, that's that's (stutter) a really old concept and it's been overdone in so many movies and I just feel like that's just one of the most boring film I've seen this year so I absolutely don't recommend it
If you're that big of a fan so Cillian Murphy maybe, but overall the movie had like, (stutter) it was just like really limited
I don't really think they got creative
I thought because they were on a spaceship it really limited like the story telling and it was just really bad
It's not good science fiction
It's not, you know, good in space or at least not good action not, it's just (stutter) bad
Hello, and welcome to the September edition of the OnCell Newsletter.
I hope everyone's Fall is off to a great start!
With school back in full swing, we've put together a panel to talk with some of our college and university customers.
Please check it out in this newsletter.
I'm here to review this movie and it's called Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon
And it's rated PG-thirteen
And it's about (uhh) martial arts fighting and (uhh) believe it was really based in China and about (uhh) these two master fighers, and they're all their abilites and the storyline that goes with it's real interesting
And (uhh) this (uhh) young woman here, she (uhh) comes out as a, you know another master fighter but she tries to hide it
But the stories the story's (stutter) okay and the (uhh) fight scenes, you know if you're really, if you're into martial arts and that kind of thing this is a good one, I mean it's really good choreographed fight scenes
But (uhh) it was (uhh) kind of strange and I didn't really understand (uhh) a lot about it but
(uhh) If you enjoy the martial arts arts (stutter) and understand, you know a lot of the things that are behind the martial arts, this will be an interesting one for you to see but
(uhh) For me it was a little bit boring, and (umm) (uhh) but you might, you might (stutter) see something different in it, so
I'm here to review this movie called Millennium
And it stars Kris Kristofferson
And it's an older movie
It's been out for quite a while, but it's on (uhh) DVD now
And (uhh) it's rated PG-thirteen
And this is (uhh) about time travel
And about (uhh) people way in the future that (uhh) come back to our time and different times and (uhh) the the (stutter) things that they do
I don't want to mess up the story for you, but (uhh) it's interesting because, you know, it's about futuristic things and time travel, but (uhh) the story's kind of, kind of (stutter) nothing
You know? It's kind of boring and it's so far out there and (uhh) it's just kind, it's just really unbelievable
But if you like the idea of time travel and that kind of thing, you might enjoy this, because it gives you a little different idea about, you know, how things might be
So (uhh) it's been, it's an older movie, like I said
It's been out for a long time, but you can find it on DVD now, and (uhh) your prices will vary
So (uhh) try it and (uhh) you may enjoy it, you know, more than I did
Hi
My name is Kaitlyn
I'm doing a review on the movie Taxi with Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon
Okay
Two thumbs down
This movie was pretty bad
(umm) Not only was it cheesy, but the storyline {sigh} was just dumb
(umm) Supposedly, USA Today says it's hilarious, real belly laughs, but, yeah, it was funny, but it was funny because it was so stupid
(umm) I don't even know why we own this video, to be honest with you
(umm) Maybe it was my husband's, but {sigh} I would not pay money to see this movie or buy this movie
I don't even know why they paid money to make this movie
I mean, it was pretty bad
I like Queen Latifah and I like Jimmy Fallon, but they just don't do very well together, I guess
So, anyway, that's my review of this movie
Alright, the film I'm reviewing right here is a Paramount (uhh) movie
It's (uhh) Jackass The Movie, Special Collectors Edition
This is a great movie
I think this is one of the funniest movies I've probably seen in a long time
(umm) I dunno, it's a compilation of a whole bunch of stupid stunts by the MTV gang, Johnny Knoxville, Steve O, and all those guys
It's really funny
It's really stupid, so you have to have an open mind because there's a lot of male nudity and (uhh) just absolutely retarded stuff so
I'd say it's really good, and you should see it only if you have a very like, you're not squeamish or anything like that, so yeah
I put that warning out there, not for younger kids
This is R rated and (uhh) a lot lot of crazy stuff that your kids will try to do if you don't yeah so don't let them see this at all
But (uhh) yeah for me hilarious, funny
Watch it with the guys
Watch it with anybody
It's hilarious, good college film
may also be required
In negotiation with police and other stakeholders, you can identify most evidence-based treatments to apply the crime problems
All stakeholders should then probably agree on the division of responsibilities for the entire project
So, making it clear in terms of who's responsibility it will be and perhaps trying to seek that undertaking at the beginning of the project so it's clear for everyone
And then, there's opportunity too, to do some research identifying effective treatments for similar crime problems in other areas or jurisdictions as well
The Victoria Police can support applications by providing a letter from the relevant local area commanders
You can even speak to your local crime prevention officers or other police as well
So, it's not just limited to your local area commanders

Hi, this is mom of three for Expo TV
Today I'd like to review the Disney DVD Hercules
This film was originally released in nineteen ninety seven
It's rated G and it's ninety-three minutes long
It follows the story of Hercules who has god parents, but he was raised on earth
He never fit in
He has this abnormal amount of strength and he doesn't know where it comes from and he finally finds out that his dad is Zeus, but he has to be do a true heroic act before he can go and live with the gods in a temple
He enlists the friend, the help of his friend (umm) Pegasus, (stutter) his friend Phil, rather, to help him do this
But all this time, there is a villain of the the name of Hades, who's trying to come along and make it so he can't do his heroic deed
He uses Meg to try to get him derailed from his mission
Hercules is very trusting and even though Phil does not trust Meg, they don't know what's happening
I found this film to be one of the worst Disney movies
It, I don't even know how it got a G rating
It's very violent and it's not one that I would recommend
The only bonus feature on the DVD is the making of Hercules feature
Today I'm doing a review for Weekend at Bernie's Two
(umm) I really liked the original Weekend at Bernie's so I thought I would like this one
Basically after the first movie ends and they spend their weekend with Bernie (umm) these two guys (uhh) go to their bank and find out they're fired (umm) and they also find out that Bernie, when he was alive, had stolen two million dollars and it's in the Virgin Islands
So they have to go back to the Virgin Islands and, and find the money
(umm) This is the movie playing in the background
(umm) It's it's (stutter) just not as funny as the first one, I like, I liked the first one a lot better
In this movie there's this, you know, in the Virgin Islands there's this lady who brings them back to life and, I don't know, I just thought that was kind of lame
Hello expo my name is Jocelyn
I have to tell you about a movie that was fantastic
It's Ratatouille and it was really a great animated movie
This movie is so good because it's very real
The reason it's real is because the animators were actually asked to go to France and film everything culinary, just the way it would be cooked so that it could be reproduced in this movie
That is what is one of the things that makes it so great
Remy is played by Patton Oswalt and he does a fantastic job of you can even see the expressions of Remy, but and that's quite odd, even when he's running or when he's thinking about what he's cooking
That really translates so there has to be some great animators to do that
One prepares the food, it's just as it is, was (stutter) or is to be prepared, the way that the culinary chefs do to prepare food
He wants to be a chef although and, since he's a rat that sort of holds him back because society frowns on that
His family is appalled because he, he (stutter) wants to be a chef because they can't seem to figure out why he just doesn't want to sniff garbage
So as they would have it, he ends up in a store in France, and from there there's some hilarious wonderful authentic and funny, funny stuff that is just so right on with food network and the way cooking should be
It's just a wonderful movie for all ages, so if you want to see something that's very entertaining with a lot of laughs and even get educated about how to cook, with a (uhh) profession such as a gourmet chef from France, you'll love Remy
Hello my name's Karen and I'm gonna review for you the movie Elf
(umm) Honestly right up front I'll tell you that I'm not a person that likes to watch a seasonal movies out of season
(umm) Elf being a Christmas movie
(umm) This one I don't mind watching any time
(umm) It stars Will Ferrell
(umm) I really enjoy watching Will Ferrell in this movie
(umm) He plays elf
And he has (umm) (umm) slipped into Santa's bag in an orphanage so he's raised raised (stutter) in (umm) the North Pole as an elf
(umm) He finds out that he was adopted, he is human and this (umm) takes him on a journey to meet his father
(umm) It's funny as usual (umm) Will Ferrel's just (umm) out of the box on this one
(umm) (umm) And also stars (umm) Bob Newhart
(umm) Haven't seen him around for a while so he's very, funny too
(umm) The whole movie is a Christmas theme about an elf who (umm) learns that he's human
He's on the track to find his father
(umm) And then he also (umm) is gonna teach some people about (umm) spreading (stutter) Christmas cheer all around the year and what the true meaning of Christmas is
(umm) I think (umm) this movie is (umm) (umm) PG
And it is (umm) ninety-five minutes long, so it's not a very long movie but even though it is a Christmas I suggest you watch it any time of the year
Hey, Summer here for ExpoTV
Today I'm reviewing for you a movie that I truly dislike
The movie is eight millimeters with Nicolas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix
Now, the basic premise behind this movie is Nicolas Cage is a cop, and he's trying his best to find out what happened with a six-year-old crime
So he is reinvestigating an old crime
And in the process, he finds (umm) an integrated trail of mystery, murder, thrillers
And all of it is being captured on eight millimeter film
(umm) I did not like the storyline of the movie, first of all
(umm) I I (stutter) liked even less the fact that there was actually on film violence, rape, and murder
It, it (stutter) was on film, and then (stutter) they showed you clips of these films
And I I (stutter) wasn't, you know, thrilled with that
I mean, there can be, I've watched many, many psychological thrillers that were really, really good
And they didn't need to show this
I understand that the basis of the movie is the eight millimeter film basis, but it could have been done in a different way
I mean, the the (stutter) people that were involved in this movie were the writer that wrote this was the same writer that wrote Seven
And (uhh) Joel Schumacher, he he (stutter) was the one that directed this movie
And and (stutter) they've done such great movies that that (stutter) were so successful in the past without the usage of of (stutter) this type of film and footage
So I didn't like eight millimeter
I'm going to give it one star because I just don't like the the (stutter) basis behind how the movie was filmed and the way that the eight millimeter film was integrated into the footage
So, eight millimeter
If you want to watch something like this, you go on with your bad self
I do not like the film
And I will not watch it again
It's rated R
And it is with Nicolas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix
One out of five stars
MS. NULAND: We have seen some statements from the regime side.
We’ve also seen some statements from the opposition side, Free Syrian Army, saying that they will abide by the UN Security Council and the UN Special Envoy’s call for a ceasefire tomorrow beginning for the Eid holiday and continuing into Sunday.
What we are hoping and expecting is that they will not just talk the talk of ceasefire, but that they will walk the walk, beginning with the regime.
And we will be watching very closely.
QUESTION: Right, but does it really mean anything if the government hasn’t agreed to a political transition?
Hello, this is Ron Paul with your weekly update for August 8th.
The Super Congress created by the recent debt ceiling increase deal is a typical example of something nefarious attached to a bigger bill that is rushed through Congress without giving Members ample opportunity to consider the full ramifications.
This commission may turn into an early Christmas present for the well-heeled lobbyists of K Street.
This is because the commission presents a huge opportunity for lobbying firms to sneak their client's pet projects and issues into whatever legislation is created by the commission.
The fact that automatic cuts to defense are named if the committee deadlocks simply signals to the military industrial complex to bring their A game to the lobbying effort.
One red flag I am constantly aware of in my position as a Congressman is that highly complex and convoluted legislation frequently has dangerous provisions hidden in the fine print.
Elaborate legislative packages force lawmakers to take the bad with the good, and often if they refuse, they are accused of voting against the positive provision - never mind the blatant Constitutional violations in the bill, the spending, the waste, and the unchecked expansion of government.
I don't usually have to read too much of a bill like that before encountering something unconstitutional, or simply unwise.
Then I have to vote no.
That doesn't seem to be the case with a majority of legislators, unfortunately.
In order to ram through one special interest's favorable treatment or giveaway, a certain amount of horse-trading is done.
The end result is mammoth bills with myriads of unrelated provisions that favor those with the best lobbyists at the expense of everyone else.
The creation of a 12 member committee to preside over $1.5 trillion in spending decisions, and the exclusion of the rest of Congress also means lobbying firms can focus their efforts on an anointed few, which is certainly more manageable for them than having to deal with the entire Congress.
Every cut considered will, of course, have a recipient on the other end whose livelihood is being threatened.
The probable outcome is that any cuts realized will be more a function of lobbying prowess than the merits or demerits of the actual programs on the chopping block.
Make no mistake - I am enthusiastically for cutting government spending.
The goal should be to eventually reduce government down to the size and scope of its constitutional limitations.
However, the process of getting there must also be constitutional.
Concentrating such special authority to fast track legislation affecting so many special interests to a small, select committee is nothing more than an unprecedented power grab.
Hey there Expo tv, Summer here and today I have a review for you of Silent Hill
Now Silent Hill the video game was truly a scary video game
I played this game and and (stutter) I was left basically with night terrors, I had no idea what I was gonna do, I couldn't sleep I was scared
So when I watched this movie I was ready
I was ready I slept half the day I was ready to be up all night frightened all out of my wits
And I watched the movie and was left just stunned
This is the least scary movie I have ever watched in my entire life
The movie from beginning to end does not even begin to employ the scariness of the video game and I know that's what they were trying for
And I I I (stutter) didn't like the storyline, I didn't like how they explained the things that were happening in Silent Hill
And I just didn't like the movie, so this is Silent Hill
It's two hours long, it's rated R for strong horror and violence, gore, disturbing images, some language, and I would not watch this movie again
I was very upset with myself for having purchased the movie and basically being left with something I'm not gonna watch ever again
So, Silent Hill gets one star from me, it did not scare me, there was no ha moments or anything of that sort it was just plain old fashioned bad
Bad try, bad attempt with some gore thrown in
Not a good movie
What's up expo tv, goob here
(uhh) Today I'm going to review Man of the Year starring Robin Williams
It's movie about Robin Williams playing a (uhh) late night comedian who decides he wants to become president
So he runs for president and due to some computer glitches, (uhh) he wins
(uhh) That's Christopher Walken's in it, Lewis Black, (umm) few other people
It's rated PG-thirteen (uhh) I would rate it NS for never see, because it is extremely boring
(uhh) I found myself just losing complete interest halfway through the movie
(uhh) They, it's like they abandoned the premise
He gets elected and then suddenly he goes from a comedian to a real politician and it gets real, it just gets boring it's not funny
(uhh) Even the part where he's running for president is not funny, it's just, there's hardly any jokes
And it's weird because I like (uhh) the real life character that he's, you know, portraying, John Stewart or Stephen Colbert
You know I love those guys but
Suddenly when Robin Williams takes over in the movie it's just like wow, he's not boring, he's not funny like they are
It's just not interesting
(umm) I don't even remember how it ends, I got was so bored with it I was, wasn't (stutter) even paying attention
I started doing other stuff
(umm) And it was a struggle just to make it all the way through it
So if you want to, you know, watch a bad movie and bore yourself to death, check out {laugh} Man of the Year
Hi this is a review for the movie Blue Collar Comedy Tour, it's playing behind me and actually what this movie is about is you have (umm) the four stars of the movie and that's Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, Ron White, and Larry the Cable Guy, and it's actually a movie about their comedy shows (umm) and with little bits and pieces mixed in it's like their stand up routines and than some ins and out's between it
(umm) Unfortunately I didn't think that this was the funniest movie, so I guess what it really comes down to is this movie is sort of like it takes stand up comedian's doing their act you put it into a movie and ya throw in some separate parts where their you know you're going into sidelines of of (stutter) what's going on and that's kind of what this movies about
(umm) Unfortunately it falls pretty flat for me
It's rated (umm) PG for some sexually related type of humor
I want to tell you about a DVD
(umm) It's Gosford Park
Now this is, you know, award winner
The cast is just incredible
(umm) Helen Mirren and just everybody
I really, really, really wanted to like this movie
(umm) I am not a fan of it
I bought the DVD basically because (umm) I heard it was really, really good, it got a lot of good ratings but I was not, I'm not thrilled with it at all
(umm) I found a lot of the acting to be quite pretentious and it was (uhh) supposed to be a mystery and I pretty much figured out who was gonna die and who did it (umm) well before the movie (stutter) was even halfway through
I thought it was kind a heavy handed storytelling
But it's very pretty to look at
(umm) The costumes are great
The acting is for the most part pretty good
There's a few people on there who was, I thought was a bit ham handed with their acting
(umm) I really can't recommend anybody buying this film because it's not something you want to watch over
It's one of those "oh, okay, I'm done with this" type of movie and (umm) so I really wish I had (uhh) maybe previewed it, or someone had given me an honest review of it
Cause I just found it (umm) boring
Honestly it was boring
(umm) and I'm a fan of British mysteries, a big fan of British mysteries and of British (umm) {noise} in the countryside type of shows so I was very unhappy with how bad this one turned out to be
Hi Expo friends, this is Jill
I'd like to take a minute to tell you about one of my favorite movies, the silliest I've ever seen
My family loves it, especially my four year old, it is called Dinosaur
This is a Disney movie and we love it
This movie (umm) stars many different (umm) characters we have here a family of lemurs
And this family of lemurs raises a dinosaur named Aladar
And Aladar (umm) is the only one of his kind left (umm) his egg was in an unfortunate accident
All of the eggs in his nest were destroyed which left him by himself
The egg was taken by a big pterodactyl like bird and dropped into several different situation by different animals and what not and ends up in this tree and the lemurs find him
And this movie is about Aladar living with his family of lemurs
They go through many many different adventures and trials including (umm) a comet that comes and hits the Earth and their home island is destroyed but they end up moving to another one
And (umm) we just love it, it's a great story and there's Aladar when he's just a baby
(umm) We love it, I can't say enough good things about it
There are though a couple, two or three scenes that are extremely loud and intense and may scare small children
(umm) But other than that, it's just great, we love it
Once again, this is Dinosaur by Walt Disney, the colors on the movie are fabulous, the story is great
We watch it all the time
As the world has become more integrated economically and the relationship between economics and politics has become tighter and tighter and more interesting over time, I think this has been one of the really interesting growth areas.
Both in the practice of international affairs and and in the more academic research that's related to many of these areas.
Well the big questions that we confront in our everyday life are those that really reflect the challenges that our government faces and it works with a lot of other parties.
Community service organisations, big international organisations to tackle those.
Climate change, poverty, to how we deliver public services on a day to day basis.
Who is Government accountable to in this different world.
Hey, what's goin' on guys!
My name is Jesse, I'm 33 and I'm from Pensacola, Florida.
I'm a basketball player from an early age.
I’m here to share with you my testimonial about the jump manual and how it helped me to increase my vertical.
Before I discovered the jump manual and started using the jump manual workouts I was pretty much an average jumper.
I could reach the backboard jumping off of One foot with Two hands and I could also touch the rim when jumping off of One foot with One hand but still, I was nowhere close to dunking.
and I started looking for ways to improve my vertical beacsue that just wasn't OK with me.
I wanted to be a jumper that people would want to gather around in the gym and watch him dunk.
I wanted to be able to catch alley-oops and throw the ball down like a hardcore proffesional basketball player.
So I started doing some research because I just wasn't happy with where I was and I knew that I had to do some research to find a program or to find something that could really help me improve my vertical so that I’ll be able to dunk.
‘cause this was my dream.
and I did some research online and I found the jump manual.
and I knew right away that this was going to be the program for me.
I knew that this gonna be the program that would take me to the next level.
About the program... when I started the program immediately I noticed gains in my vertical.
and I didn't measure my vertical before I started using the jump manual but I’m using the rim on the basket as a gauge to how high I’m jumping and how much I’m improving.
and before I started using the jump manual I was barely reaching the rim on a good day jumping off of One foot.
attorney general, a deputy defense secretary
And so, as a result, I think you saw the candidates not necessarily giving so much red meat that some of the base voters would really be enthusiastic about

RAY SUAREZ: What were the standout moments of last night's program
ARI SHAPIRO: I think people were very surprised that Newt Gingrich took the stance on immigration that he did
This was the first debate where Newt Gingrich was in the lead in some polls
And he could have played it safe
When this child was born, it shifted the atmosphere
It started a new beginning



JONES: When I see Ezekiel expounding in the pulpit he has a different demeanor and he's firm and he's assured about what he's doing
People use it to describe to women who just, like, wear clothes that they consider revealing
And the word is meant to mean, “that kind of woman is bad
” The attitude and the description are all bound up together
Now, maybe you have opinions and reasons for those opinions that you feel justify using this word
But it might also be the case that you don’t actually think there’s anything wrong with having casual sex, or wearing certain kinds of clothes
So, you might want to think twice about using a word like that
Because when you use it, you’re signaling a specific attitude to other people

So if it’s an attitude you don’t really hold, and one you don’t think others should hold, you should take care not to spread it through your speech

Now let me make just one more point
No one is telling you what you should or shouldn’t say here
Hi, I'm John Green, and this is not Crash Course: World History because we're taking a week off
However, we do have four episodes of World History left
After that, we will be done
We will be done learning about the history of the world
We will have completed it
We will know everything that there is to know about world history

Stan has just informed me that, apparently, there is more world history than just what we talked about on Crash Course: World History
That's disappointing to learn
He also says that some stuff happened today that we haven't covered, and that stuff will happen tomorrow, and et cetera…hhuuhhh

It just keeps happening! Anyway, speaking of Stan: starting in a few weeks, Stan is going to be hosting a Crash Course miniseries on intellectual property and copyright law, which is hugely important to all of us who care about making things and art and the quality of internet, so I'm very excited for that
Also, there's going to be Crash Course: Economics
Adrian Hill &amp; Jacob Clifford will be teaming up to teach you economics so that you can understand, you know, why you are oppressed by the system of capitalism
Apparently Stan says that I can't say that
So that you can understand why the system of capitalism has been so beneficial to you
Apparently Stan says I also can't say that

That's why I'm going—I'm going to, to learn as well
As for me, in the coming year I'll be popping into Crash Course videos here and there, but I have this other job, writing books
Come to think of it, it's both an intellectual property problem and an economics problem
So I, I'm going to try to write a book in the coming year, so you won't see quite as much of me, but enjoy Crash Course: Economics and Crash Course: Intellectual Property
Stan says that I have to leave the frame now so that he can enter it
Bye! Stan: Hi, I'm Stan Muller, and I'm a real person
I'm very excited that this April I'm going to spend a few weeks teaching you about intellectual property

Second you can use your controller to protect your tank and home
Most controllers allow you to connect float switches to make your own auto top off operated by the controller
There are a few nice aspects to this
One you can put a float in much higher where it is less likely to have issues as a third fail safe, controllers like the Apex also have leak detectors which detect spills and can turn off pumps and notify you
Lastly advanced controllers also have the ability to monitor salinity so it can also turn off the top off pump if the salinity were to get too low

She wanted to speak out -- she wanted people to know the truth about what was happening in her country
So it was a revelation when, years later, she discovered a group called WOZA whose mission is the very opposite of silence
WOZA was started back in 2003 to empower women to speak out about the issues affecting their families and their country -- desperate hunger
crumbling health and education systems
domestic violence and rape
David Allison&gt;&gt; Day 10 of Doha, and both the process and the substance is really disappointing.
The power of money to influence even this convention that's supposed to be all about protections of trade in the environment keeps getting beat up by large sums of money and the kind of industrial lobbying that you see often in Washington.
If CITES is ever going to be successful again, the people who care about these endangered and protected species, and who believe that trade really can be used for conservation are all going to have to come together to demonstrate that we can make a difference.
In the arsenal of things that we take to market, I think what we continue to have is, as a core competency, is not just data, not just knowledge, but it’s real insight.
And translating that insight into terms of opportunities and outcomes on behalf of our clients is just simply a different conversation.
Within media brands, we just hired a chief marketing officer for a very large retailer.
I think the fact that we offer degrees related to arts, technology, media, things like that, probably give us an advantage as to the way that we are approaching on line marketing.
CINDY SELFE: Our plan for sustainability is almost three-dimensional, isn't it?
Or four-dimensional.
It's inter-generational in that it's across time, but it's also across institutions and across geographical borders.
So we try and cast the widest intentional networks that we can, to make sure that we invite a lot of people in.

Hi, I'm Gary Wilgenbusch, a Quickbooks ProAdvisor and staff accountant in the Waterloo office.
In our Summer 2012 QuickBooks seminar, we covered linking various transactions, particularly in the accounts receivable and payable sections.
In 2006 over forty-three billion dollars were spent in the pet industry.
I'm Mike Campbell with Doggie Styles from Beverly Hills, California.
I'm here to talk a little bit about buying wholesale to resell retail.
There are a lot of different ways to find merchandise, there are trade shows for every different industry that you can attend, meet a multitude of vendors in that industry and find out all of the different products that are available.
There are also trade magazines, I personally subscribe to four different trade magazines in the pet industry, so I can see articles about different trends in the pet industry, I can see articles about new products in the pet industry, and it's very easy for me to stay on top of that and know what's available to the marketplace.
You always want to be bringing in something new for your customers, so you want to be able to find wholesalers who have all the different types of products that you need.
I'm very lucky in my business because I've been able to build it and have a certain reputation and so a lot of the vendors actually come to me, the wholesalers actually come to Doggie Styles to show me their products.
I've got a calendar that's just full of appointments with different vendors who want to come in and show me their new products.
So I get a first look at things before any other retailers in this industry, in certain instances, so, for me that's great.
I can get first dibs on something new that nobody else has.
As far as buying from wholesalers, there are a lot of different payment terms that you can also have.

And of course, you also have a great clientele, so that's one of the best ways that you can answer this question
Sixth most common question that is asked is, How well do you handle a change
Well, the philosophy behind this question is to know, would you be able to cope up with a change
Because usually companies definitely come up with different strategies, employees come and go, so would you be able to handle that
People usually end up saying, Oh of course, I am great at handling a change
Well, trust me the interviewer would not be impressed with this answer
my children were teenage, and if my wife was away, I would have to get one of them to come down with me to the bank machine and they'd say, "Dad, what's my cut"
And I would say, "Jeez, hang on"

This is Patrick Munro, Financial Adviser, talking about the difference between IRA's and Certificates of Deposit.
IRA's are very strong savings vehicles for one reason, the word tax deferral.
Tax deferral means that as you put money into an IRA, it grows within that investment, and you are not required to pay taxes on the rate of return as well, so therefore, you get compounding within the investment over time.
This is financial adviser Patrick Munro answering the question, how can I determine the amount of equity I have in my home?
This is a question answered by a lot of Americans.
And the home, of course, is one of the largest assets that anyone ever achieves.
And when you originally take out the mortgage, you are required to put a down payment down.
It would be very valuable for someone to get a sense of how people regarded their lives and their family's history in the period of the early 21st century.

But I personally prefer the Cornell note taking style
I just find that it helps me to organize all of my notes so that they flow logically and my notes and clear and easy to read and that are set out well
there, but it's good to function as well as you can in the local languages
When I say I speak only English, I'm not bragging about it, it's a shame I don't speak the local languages
But we speak the world's linguistic common denominator
If a Greek meets a Norwegian hiking in the Alps, how do they communicate
Broken English, what Greek speaks Norwegian

It's inexcusable for you to be in a country, and not know the nice words
It's rude, it's bad style
That excuses the fact that Americans are so lazy when it comes to languages
Now, for me, I just think it's polite to start the conversation by asking, "parlez-vous anglais
Hi Omaha Chiropractor Dr. Christine Zorad.
The article today is from the Doctor's Resource on my website.
The title is "The Sugar Industry Makes Headlines." The sugar industry may have a shady past.
JMA Internal Medicine and the New York Times recently reported on in the nineteen sixties, the sugar industry trade group (which is now known as a Sugar Association) paid off some Harvard scientists to downplay the effects of sugar on heart disease.
There's a link below the video so click on that and you can read the article yourself.
Any questions you can call me at 402-210-8490 I'm available to help you.
In the office we talk about foods of course.
Sugar is one of the things that's on the list of any healthy diet to eliminate or at least reduce added sugars to foods.
I encourage you to become a label reader and everything that you buy that's processed may have some sugar in it.
So that would be one way that you could start reducing how much sugar you take in, would be to read your labels and just choose something different.
I'm a proponent of real food and whole food and to make more of your food at home from scratch.
I'm Mike Campbell, with Doggie Styles, in Beverly Hills, California, and I'd like to talk about buying a retail business.
Some people are lucky enough to have an idea, and want to see it through from the very beginning and start their own business.
Other people feel it's easier not to have to deal with all of the start up costs and and the confusion, but to actually buy a business of their own.
Hey guys, my name is Maria
I am originally from Romania, now living in the US, and I just wanted to make a very quick video about Forskolin
For most of my life I've struggled with weight gain
In the last two years I've had some success with the THM program, for those of you who are familiar with that
But recently a friend of mine was having a lot of success with Forskolin
And actually before trying Forskolin I had never taken any weight loss supplement

But it was pretty obvious that this was working well for Anette, and she has a similar body type to me so I figured, why not give it a try
I've been taking it for 9 weeks now, just over 9 weeks
And I'm down 13 pounds
And honestly I feel so much healthier
The biggest difference I think is my appetite
I don't have the same urge to eat like I did
I just feel a lot better
I dont believe Forskolin is some magic pill, because it's not
You still need to develop good eating habits
But there is no doubt that it has worked really well for me to control my appetite
So I would definitely recommend giving it a try
Click the link in the description and you can buy it where I bought mine
Thanks guys for watching, and have a great day
Before I do talk, however, about our relationship, both of us were just talking about the horrific attack in Paris today, the murderous attack on the headquarters of Charlie Hebdo in Paris.
I would like to say directly to the people of Paris and of all of France that each and every American stands with you today, not just in horror or in anger or in outrage for this vicious act of violence, though we stand with you in solidarity and in commitment both to the cause of confronting extremism and in the cause which the extremists fear so much and which has always united our two countries: freedom.
No country knows better than France that freedom has a price, because France gave birth to democracy itself.
France sparked so many revolutions of the human spirit, borne of freedom and of free expression, and that is what the extremists fear the most.
They may wield weapons, but we in France and in the United States share a commitment to those who wield something that is far more powerful - not just a pen, but a pen that represents an instrument of freedom, not fear.
Free expression and a free press are core values, they are universal values; principles that can be attacked but never eradicated, because brave and decent people around the world will never give in to the intimidation and the terror that those seeking to destroy those values employ.
Deloitte recently announced the appointment of Craig W.
Hi, I'm here to review the movie The Babe starring John Goodman
(umm) This tells the story of Babe Ruth from his (uhh) rough beginnings as a incorrigible little boy dumped by his parents into a Baltimore orphanage
(uhh) While he is at (stutter) orphanage, his life is pretty miserable as the kids tease him for his body type and (uhh) the brothers (uhh) the religious order back then, believed in corporal punishment and got away with it
(umm) He grew up to be a strong athlete
(umm) Was signed by the Baltimore Orioles
(uhh) When he showed a little bit of talent, he was sold to the Boston Red Sox, who eventually sold him to the New York Yankees
(uhh) Leading to the one of the great curses in baseball, the curse of the Bambino
Where the Red Sox didn't win the World Series for ninety-some years
(umm) But I find while the story of Babe Ruth is (umm) a a (stutter) very good story of a young man making something of himself (umm) the portrayal by John Goodman
Babe Ruth was not a fat pig, slob
He was a gifted athlete
He had a barrel chest and spindly legs
We get the impression of him that he was this behemoth his entire life because most of the pictures we have of Babe Ruth are from his later years in life
Hi {laugh}
I'm here to review the movie The Door in the Floor starring Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger
(umm) This is a very disturbing melodrama about a {sigh} (uhh) estranged couple, I guess, I mean they still live together but they are (umm) very distant from each other
Jeff Bridges plays a children's author and in the beginning of the movie he hires a summer intern to help him
(uhh) The young man is probably colleged age
He comes into (uhh) to try to help Jeff Bridges but like I said Jeff Bridge's character is very bizarre and Kim Basinger's character is very bizarre
(umm) This movie goes on to attempt to explain their weird behavior (umm) but it is, there are some very disturbing scenes in this movie and it is (uhh) kind of difficult to understand and then really wonder why it was made
Hi, I'm Liz and I'm here to talk about The Great New Wonderful
It's not that great or that wonderful, actually
The thing about The Great New Wonderful is it's an independent movie, but independent movies that's been around for a while
And they can't trade on cute and quirky anymore, they need to have some meat to them
There's not a lot of substance to this movie it's just sort of following a trail of people that are sort of distantly connected to each other through other characters in the movie and there's not a lot of payoff at the end
(umm) I think some of the story some of the (stutter) storylines are tired out, there's there's (stutter) a psychiatrist who's driving his patient crazy you know, by analyzing him too much
I mean we never we never (stutter) heard that joke before and (umm) there's just strange things that don't seem to really mean anything or make any sense, and I think we've moved past that, especially independent film needs to have more to it than just, oh look at all this chaos
Yeah life is chaos, life is boring we know that
It needs to be something some art to it, and there's not a lot of art to this movie I don't think
(umm) You've got you've got (stutter) a great cast, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Tony Shalhoub, Edie Falco from the Sopranos, Stephen Colbert, obviously the Colbert Report
(umm) Colbert Report, sorry
It's it's (stutter) They're all good in their individual ways and yet it doesn't add up to much
And I think that's the problem this movie, it doesn't really leave you with anything
So, not recommended
Today what I'd like to review is the movie Michael Clayton starring George Clooney as Michael Clayton
(uhh) I'd like to state that this is Michael Clayton who is the fixer of (uhh) court cases and not Michael Clayton the wide receiver for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
You go into it thinking it's a football movie (uhh) you're definitely going to be in for a little surprise
This movie I did not enjoy whatsoever
It was extremely long and boring to me
It was like a courtroom, a courtroom drama type movie which I definitely would not recommend, but that's just my taste, you might enjoy it
So basically the story is about this guy named Michael Clayton who is a fixer and I wouldn't really say that he enjoys his job but I definitely think he's good at it
And he's got some family problems
(uhh) He's divorced
He's not doing so hot (uhh) cash wise in the beginning
(umm) This movie, I don't know, I I (stutter) kinda I I (stutter) started to zone out because the movie seemed like it lasted so long
I had to look it up online cause I couldn't even tell you
It said it's two and a half hours long
Honestly when you're in the theater it's going to seem like about six to eight
The movie never ends
It's like it drags on and it's one of those movies where you really have to be thinking the whole time, so when all you're thinking about is "god when is this gonna end?" it's hard to concentrate on the movie, which is why I got really confused towards the middle and the end
Started off okay but I think the movie got progressively worse
Hi expo TV this is Vasili and I am going to be reviewing Fred Claus
I have to say even though I knew I was going to hate it, I was not proven wrong I mean it was a really horrible movie
Vince Vaughn plays Santa Claus' Nicolas Claus' brother the quote on quote black sheep of the family and apparently due to some saint mythology the family and spouses of a saint do not ever die or grow old so Vince Vaughn is preserved even as it's hundred of years later he appears to be the same age and he's dating Rachel Weisz who I have no idea why she was even in the film
I though she does a lot better films than this sort of one and even though it's a horrible, holiday film I maybe this could be good but no it was bad
The jokes weren't funny, they were really cliche, you know a lot of elf jokes and anyway I just don't recommend it
Hi, ExpoTV
This is Vasily, and I am going to be reviewing Mr
Magorium's Wonder Emporium
And after just seeing a horrible movie for a class, I thought, Maybe I'll go see a better movie, maybe Mr
Magorium's Wonder Emporium will be better
But {laugh} I have to say, it was, like, five-hundred-thousand percent worse
I have no idea what that movie was about
You know? I think it was trying to emulate Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, but it really just didn't make sense
It was just a very imaginative, very boring movie starring Dustin Hoffman and Natalie Portman
And, you know, Natalie Portman, I like her usually
I don't know why she did this movie
And Dustin Hoffman with a lisp, you know, is not a pretty sight
So I don't think this movie was good for kids or adults
And I think everyone will be really, really bored
So, unfortunately, I have to give it a zero out of ten
It was the worst movie I think I've ever seen in my whole life
Hi Expo TV, I'd like to review a movie currently in theaters that I saw
This was the movie Fred Claus, starring Vince Vaughn
(umm) This is pretty much your typical holiday movie
I wouldn't go to this expecting anything extravagant or mind blowing
It's gonna be some cheap laughs (uhh) crummy plot and that's about it
I wouldn't expect much more I mean, it's Christmas time
They have to come out with these movies it seems like
Kind of disappointing that Vince Vaughn is in it cause I thought he was funnier than that
But if you can get over the fact that it is a crappy holiday movie, you might actually enjoy it sort of
(uhh) As you may or may not know the plot is of Santa Claus' brother (umm) is also privileged to live forever like Santa and that's pretty much all you need to know
Hello, my name is Sarah, and I will be doing the video review for the movie Josie and the Pussycats
(uhh) Basically, I really did not like this movie at all
(umm) I felt it was kinda cheesy
(umm) Of course I had low expectations at that, and hose expectations weren't even met
So you know, to recommend this movie, you know I really wouldn't
(umm) I, I (stutter) found one thing about this movie that I thought was kind of interesting how (umm) these record companies put (uhh) subliminal messages in music to push products to get people to buy certain things
(umm) That part of the movie was pretty cool, but (umm) for the most part you know, it was, again it was too cheesy for me
You know (umm) it was actually expected to be kind of corny
So I really wouldn't recommend this, this (stutter) movie to anybody
(umm) No, I mean, basically the movie was just you know, trying to put you know, just
I just again, really just did not like this movie
I don't recommend it for people and the actors on this movie, they didn't really do a good job either
It was you know, kind of expected as well
These you know, girls that played in this movie just they didn't really do a good job
Hi my name is Will and this is my video opinion of the movie Catwoman starring Halle Berry
It's a fullscreen edition (uhh) which means you get some special features including two documentaries, the many faces of Catwoman, profiles the (stutter) evolution of the character
(umm) You get an exciting alternative ending in the (stutter) additional scenes as well
(umm) I thought that Catwoman was horrible
(uhh) Quite honestly I thought that the big budget you know, film, it should have, the, you know, computer generated images should have worked more seamlessly with the stunts and things like that
I thought that it was (uhh) it relied too, too (stutter) much on the CGI
I didn't (umm) you know, I didn't really like the way that they made her come back to life
I thought you know it, you know while it did stay true to its origin, it's just when she did come back I thought her powers were a little unreal for me
(umm) I just you know, just didn't really enjoy it
Her costume of course was great that was one of the highlights having Halle Berry in the movie, you know getting some eye candy
But to me that wasn't enough to make a great film
Hey Expo Tv, this is Victor and I have for you a review on this movie entitled Crazy Beautiful
It's got (uhh) Kirsten Dunst and Jay Hernandez and it's a really good movie
It's (umm) primarily targeted towards like the teenager kind of audience, but the cool thing about this movie is that it has a really cool soundtrack
(umm) And and (stutter) it also features one of my all time favorite bands Oskar, in the movie
So I thought that was really cool
(umm) But, it's a really cool movie because it's very it's very (stutter) real, you know
You can tell (umm) I mean, (stutters) you really start to believe in these characters, that they're going through these (uhh) experiences and stuff and I know that a lot of teenagers in high school can relate to this
It's got you know, a lot of real kind of stuff you know? I I (stutter) definitely relate to it and so (umm) Chicago Tribune gave it three stars, but I'm giving it five stars
It's just I, I, I (stutter) enjoyed the movie I'm not gonna lie
I know it's kind of cheesy but
My name is Sarah and I will be doing my video opinion of the movie Bring It on Again
(uhh) It's the sequel to the first one, (umm) basically I really did not like this movie at all
(umm) I you know it was of course expected being that it was a straight to dvd movie
(umm) I think it was kind of corny, you know I mean some of the the (stutter) jokes in here were just outrageously you know dumb for me
(umm) It, you know I mean I guess basically if you like cheerleading and you know, it's something that you do yourself, pick up the movie
But you know, I, it was not my favorite at all
It was basically about (umm) two girls going to college and joining (umm) one of the you know, great qualifying (uhh) cheer teams in the country
(umm) And basically they didn't like how things were going so they decided to start their own cheer team
And you know, then there was a competition that they had to compete for that school because that you know, school could only have one cheer team it couldn't have two
So they go through different things of you know, trying to start their own team (umm) you know, doing their own routines, pretty much starting from scratch where the first form routine had already been there
(umm) I mean I, that (stutter), you know again to me it it (stutter) was kind of boring, it just you know, didn't really enthuse me at all
(umm) You know I was kind of hoping for a little more excitement like the first one
Hi, my name is Mike and I'm here to do a movie review for Thirty Days of Night, which is a moderately new (uhh) film that's still in theaters and it stars Josh Hartnett
(umm) My wife and I saw it (uhh) believe it was two weeks ago, and (uhh) it was pretty terrible
It was not a good film, (uhh) whatsoever
(uhh) The main reason behind it was (uhh) there just really wasn't a lot of action, the colors were pretty drab
(uhh) Even though it was set in Alaska during a period (uhh) in which you get constant night, (umm) everything just seemed to not flow really well, the plot was kind of boring
And they really didn't do a lot with the (uhh) with the new slant on everything that they were going for, which was having the vampires be (uhh) the bad guys in this (uhh) horror movie
(umm) Just overall the flow was awful, (uhh) the audience seemed to not enjoy really anything as well as if (uhh) me or my wife didn't enjoy anything
Halfway through the film, (uhh) (uhh) quite a few people left because they were pretty bored
And (uhh) just overall it wasn't really enjoyable
The acting was pretty stiff and stilted
(uhh) There was hardly any suspense, and just overall (uhh) not a good film {noise} so
Hey Expo
This is Jennifer, and today I'm reviewing Gladiator
This is an epic movie about a man who was a general in an army
And the man is played by Russell Crowe who is just very macho in this movie and does an excellent job playing the role
He is a general in the army and he comes home and he finds that his village has been destroyed, his home has been destroyed, and his wife and chilled, child (stutter) killed
So he goes about to exact his revenge and instead is captured and becomes a slave
He is forced to become a gladiator for the empire, and this is a movie about personal triumph and even though your body can be captured by someone, your spirit adheres and that it's how, it's how (stutter) you choose to live your life no matter what your circumstances are
Russell Crowe excels in this role and it just makes you want to stand up and cheer for him when you're watching this and you see what he goes through and what he overcomes
In the back, in the sub ground there are different scenarios that are playing out with the king and his sister and things that are going on there to watch
I don't want to give it away in case you haven't seen it
But this is definitely a movie that you can enjoy
It's a little bit long but there's a lot action and it will really just draw you in and the time will go by quickly
The DVD of course has deleted scenes and the director's commentary, always fun to see these things
And it's overall just a good movie
I'd give it five stars
Definitely fun to watch
Enjoyable and a escape from reality
What's up Expo, this is Adam here again and I'm reviewing Underworld
This is the widescreen special edition, I find it to be very entertaining in widescreen, much less than the full screen actually
But a little bit about this movie, it has retaken the idea of vampires and werewolves and they have them pitted against each other in a more, in a (stutter) mortal battle
They're fighting each other for wars on end and then this movie, they, the main plot is about a, (uhh) is about a guy who is a descendant of one of these great, great (stutter) ancestors and he hold the key to a more higher power within his blood
So a little bit about that is just the, I mean I'm not gonna reveal too much about the movie
But Underworld it's definitely gonna get five out of five stars
This movie is full of action, intensity, I really like what they do with the vampires and the werewolves
Everyone's got their own little spinoff
This one, this one (stutter) has a good spinoff of them so you're not gonna be disappointed by that
So Underworld, give it five out of five stars, look for the sequel Underworld Evolution
It's all good, everything's good in this movie
Pick it up as soon as you can
Alright so next up we've got Chicago
Academy Award for best picture winner of two-thousand and two which it definitely should not have won
The Oscar should have gone to Gangs of New York, (uhh) Scorsese's masterpiece, or one of his masterpieces I think with (uhh) some other great movies, Taxi Driver and Goodfellas which I think a lot of people love more, but Chicago I thought was a terrible movie
(uhh) I like (uhh) I think the performers are good performers, Richard Gere and (uhh) Catherine Zeta Jones and Rene Zellweger
I find the ladies very attractive (uhh) and very talented actresses, I just didn't like them very much in this
To me this was like a made for TV (stutter) movie, they were trying too hard to try and reinvent the Hollywood musical and it just fell flat
I think the choreography a lot of very hard work went into it, but as a piece of entertainment I personally did not enjoy it
I thought that (uhh), you know, (umm) it's just overdone, dumb, silly, ridiculous
I thought the lighting was unbelievable, I thought the style was (uhh) hokey and contrived
I thought the story line was a little too (uhh) too (uhh) too much
So I give this a half a star out of five, and again I think the Oscar should have gone to Gangs of New York
Hi, it's Jason and I'll be doing a review on the movie Delta Farce coming right up
Thank you
Hi it's Jason and I'll continue my review on Delta Farce
(umm) Basically it's a (stutter) comedy that stars three different people, it stars Larry the Cable Guy and Bill Envall and D

(stutter) Qualls
(umm) Basically they are (umm) some army, they are mistaken to being army reserve troops
And they're (stutter) hussled away to what they thought was Iraq but what end up happening is they drop them off in Mexico instead and they try to liberate Mexico
(umm) This is by (umm) the blue collar comedy tour director Stevy Harry and (stutter) as some of you may know from the, the (umm) touring for the blue collar comedy tour
(umm) If you like these three people you might like this movie
I found this movie absolutely dumb
It just, it just (stutter) wasn't good nothing worked
(umm) These aren't my three favorite comedians
(umm) The movie's rated PG-thirteen
(umm) It's eighty minutes eighty-nine (stutter) minutes long and it was it was (stutter) (umm) filmed in two thousand seven it was completed and released, so that tells you a lot about how, how (stutter) good this movies I remember when it came out at the movie theaters it wasn't a hit at all
(umm) And also costars Danny Trejo, (umm) but that's about it I mean I don't wanna give away too much but I had a hard time sitting through this
I (stutter) just, I didn't find it funny I actually found it really stupid and as you can see in the background it's just a menu with some small clips from the movie
(umm) But if you're thinking about buying this movie I probably think twice again
Hello I would like to tell you about an excellent new movie from Disney and Pixar and that's Ratatouille
(uhh) It's about a little rat named Remy who dreams of becoming a chef
And I mean, but what restaurant will allow a rat to be a chef
So he (umm) you know, really thinks that he's never you know, that he's not gonna go anywhere
(umm) But one day he finds himself in Gusto's restaurant
And Gusto's is a (uhh) famous restaurant in Paris
And there is a boy that works at (uhh) Gusto's named Linguine who can't cook at all
(umm) So they team up together and they (umm) try to become a you know, chef together
(umm) Will it work out though, I mean can a rat actually be a chef
So watch it a find out, there's some good twists and turns in there
(umm) Brad Garrett plays the voice of Gusto
I love Brad Garret I think he's an excellent actor
(umm) Just, it's, it's (stutter) a hilarious movie
I mean you have to watch this movie it is so good the animation is excellent
(umm) You know, Disney and Pixar although you wouldn't expect anything but excellent and you definitely get that let me show you a quick clip
This is the kitchen of (umm) of Gusto's
{movie} Really good movie you watch it you'll have lots of laughs
I think you'll really enjoy it
Hi, today I'm presenting the movie that is in theaters
It's called Borat
(uhh), I would give this movie a five out five and two thumbs up
It is a hilarious movie
I loved it, and I laughed my butt off while I watched it
(umm), It's mostly about this guy named Borat who is a Kazaky reporter in America, and he's trying to learn about the culture and stuff here, and because he's so different he ends up making a fool out of himself and it's hilarious
(umm), It's kind of in a, mock documentary kind of style reality show kind of style where they follow him around with their cameras, and you see the wonderful interactions he has with Americans
Of course it's all a big joke, but, it's hilarious to see him
And he goes to like different places, and (uhh), and (uhh), country rodeos in the south and things like that
So, I definitely recommend you going and seeing Borat the movie
It's hilarious, and you'll laugh your butt off
Hi
This is a review of Good Luck Chuck
I managed to catch this at the dollar theater at my local place
(umm) And it's a good thing I did because it's not a very good movie
(uhh) Basically it's about a guy who gets cursed when he's a kid by a goth girl and now every girl he meets and gets with (umm) will marry the next man that, that (stutter) (uhh) that she meets
Or or (stutter) something, it's it's (stutter) kind of ridiculous
It's got Dane Cook as the main guy, Charlie, it's got Dan Fogler as Stu, it's got Jessica Alba as (uhh) the love interest Cam
And (umm), you know, she's beautiful and everything but this is, it's (stutter) just stupid
She's just running into stuff the whole time and it's just, it's ridiculous
(umm) Not really that funny, kind of stupid, (umm) acting's not that great
I don't know, I just, I really didn't enjoy this movie, I thought it was dumb
Hey there, ExpoTV there
I have the scariest movie in a decade
It's called Hostel
It's unrated
(uhh) But if it was rated it would be rated R because it's really bad for you and bad for the kids and there's a lot of killings and a lot of blood and a lot of gore
(uhh) It's presented by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Eli Roth
So if you know them they have sick minds and they like to make sick movies
(uhh) This movie first starts off as like a x rated because you see a lot of girls who has and a lot of guys ding dongs
So if you can get past that it's not that bad
(uhh) But the movie's about how two Americans go backpacking through Europe and they're just trying to have a good time, but they go to this hostel and eventually they get kidnapped and they get tortured, tortured (stutter)
So you should see if they survive, if they die if they bleed to death, if they get their heads chopped off, limbs chopped off, if you're into that stuff
But check it out, it's called Hostel part one, because there is a part two now
Hello expotv
(umm) I'm here right now reviewing the movie currently in theaters called The Heartbreak Kid
(umm) This movie stars Ben Stiller
(uhh) It's about this guy that marries this girl and while they're on his (stutter), while they're on their honeymoon he finds someone who he loves more, or he begins to fall in love with and so it's kind of about that
(umm) This movie's awful
(uhh) {laugh} It's probably the most predictable comedy I've ever seen
(uhh) You don't you don't (stutter) have to be clever to know what's about to happen
(umm) Most of the jokes I can put together before they were finished and it was just bad
I mean Ben Stiller is usually pretty funny
His movies aren't always, don't always have the best plot but at least they make you laugh
And this one, I mean, you can laugh about it being so bad but (uhh) that's about it
(umm) Don't see this movie
It's not a good movie
(umm) It's incredibly predictable and Carlos Mencia is in it who steals jokes
So don't see it
Hello Expo TV, I'm here to review Beowulf in three D
(uhh) This movie was a little bit disappointing to me
(uhh) After reading the book the classic, it's obviously an amazing tale
(umm) But when you go and it's adapted to film I I (stutter) just don't think it was done as well
The animation was excellent
(umm) It took my eyes a few minutes to adjust to the three D at the theater I was at when (uhh) after I adjusted I thought it looked beautiful
(umm) Especially the last fighting scene, I thought that was the best part of the movie
But on the overall, (uhh) I was kinda disappointed
I I (stutter) thought it should have been a little bit deeper
(umm) So if I were to go see this full price, I I (stutter) would not recommend it
(umm) I kinda only recommend (uhh) going to see it in matinee
(umm) I know you'll miss the 3D, but I would wait for the DVD
Hi
I'm Liz and I'm here to talk to you about The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, based on the beloved series of books by Douglas Adams, may he rest in peace
(umm) I'm not entirely convinced that the people who made this movie understood the books at all
(umm) Part of, I think, that the remarkable thing about the books is Douglas Adams wrote them sequentially, with no planning ahead of time as to what was gonna to happen
And yet, they all come around into an incredibly tight plot and theme
(uhh) That's part of what makes them so amazing
And this movie destroys all of that by sort of creating its own (umm) self-contained plot because I guess they weren't planning on making more movies
They're certainly not going to now, I don't think
(umm) Since no one really liked it that much
(umm) They just {sigh} it's hard to explain if you're not a Douglas Adams fan
You haven't, you know, read all the books and seen the movie
To really feel what it was they got wrong, there's just a feeling missing
Everything that he intended and all these sort of (umm) jokes that he meant to be funny in a particular way just aren't the same, and they've added a lot of their own jokes that are funny in a very different way, not not (stutter) what he would have wanted
(umm) It's not a great adaptation
Is it a good movie? I suppose it's kind of amusing in its own way, but it's not a good adaptation of the story
And I think the greatest example of that is the line at the very end, when Alan Rickman as the robot says, they're (stutter) heading to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, which is the name of the second, the second (stutter) novel in the series, and is an actual setting in the novel
And he says, not that anyone cares, or asked me, or whatever, but the restaurant is at the other end of the universe
The restaurant was not, even if you casually read Douglas Adams, you know the restaurant is not at the physical end of the universe, it's at the temporal end of the universe
It's a place where you can go, utilizing time travel, you can go to this particular point in time, at just the point the universe ends, and watch it end
And that's sort of the main attraction of the restaurant
It's like their evening show
That's just a really, really obvious, stupid mistake
Why did they have to make that joke? It's not that good
Considering it got something so completely wrong, I think Douglas Adams fans would just grit their teeth
(umm) And that's the kind of thing they do in this movie
And I think that makes it kind of painful
(umm) The only up side is the special effects are fantastic
The previous adaptation of Hitchhiker was done by the BBC on a shoestring budget
It looks awful
It's great, but it looks terrible
This movie is terrible, and looks great
So, you know, whatever you want to sacrifice, I guess, but, (uhh) no, this movie doesn't capture the spirit of the story at all
Hi I will review for you the special collector's edition of Tae Guk Gi
A Korean war film, (umm) the title actually translates to The Brotherhood of War
(umm) The movie itself is a lot like Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers
(umm) It's a really stylized film, so you can really get the grittiness of war that's going on all the battles and stuff in this, in the movie
(umm) It is about a the story between of two brothers who are forced to join a war going on in Korea, between the north the north (stutter) and south
(umm) As far as the actual disc, (uhh) DVD collection goes, (uhh) it comes in a two disc set, (uhh) the first disc is the widescreen version of the film and the second disc is a bonus disc that comes with about three hours of footage of behind the scenes, cast documentaries, and outtakes
(umm) It is a really well made movie and a really well made (uhh) DVD collector's edition
Hi
This is my review of Message in a Bottle
(umm) This is a movie starring Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn, and Paul Newman which was based on the best-selling Nicholas Sparks novel (umm) also entitled Message in a Bottle
(umm) I'm probably in the minority of people
(umm) I know it's got a lot of good ratings and stuff when it came out, but, really, not one of my favorite movies
And (umm) not surprising
I mean, I did watch
This was actually given to me as a gift
But (uhh) I don't really care for Nicholas Sparks' (umm) writing that much
(uhh) It always seems really cliche to me and (umm) tries to be deep, but it's really not
(uhh) So I, you know, wasn't (uhh) crazy about watching this movie in the first place
And it (uhh) I mean, it was okay
I, I (stutter) watched it through
It's not like I shut it off in the middle or anything
It was worth (umm) watching on a, you know, boring afternoon
But (umm) (uhh), you know, I would recommend it if you like the Nicholas Sparks books
And (uhh) also, not a huge Kevin Costner fan, so (umm) not really up for that
I didn't find him, I did read the book before I saw the movie, and (uhh) he didn't really fit
I don't know how I saw the character exactly, but (uhh) (umm) that's just my personal opinion
(umm) But the movie itself is one-hundred-and-thirty-one minutes long
It's a pretty long movie
And (umm) the DVD is available on Amazon dot com, along with pretty much any DVD retail
Hi
Today on ExpoTV I'm going to be reviewing the movie Mr
Magorium's Wonder Emporium
And Mr
Magorium's Wonder Emporium is (umm) a movie that's in theaters now and it stars (umm) Jason Bateman and (uhh) Natalie Portman and Dustin Hoffman
And (umm) basically it's about (umm) this guy, Dustin Hoffman, named Mr

And he has this huge magic shop
And there's, like, tons of stuff going on
And (umm) he, he (stutter) says (umm) it's time for him to leave, which kind of implies, like, he's going to die
And (umm) so he leaves, he's going to leave the store to (umm) Natalie Portman's character to, you know, run and keep it going
And (umm) also, this other guy is going to help (umm) do the bills, the character who is (umm) played by (uhh) Jason Bateman
And (umm) this guy is really, like, drab and doesn't believe in the magic of the store and (umm) is just generally a jerk
And (umm) the movie kind of goes, follows (umm) the decisions and how they affect (umm) those two characters in relation to, like, who owns the store and (umm) how the store handles (umm) each one of those characters
So it's really a fantastical, fantasy-like movie and (umm) it's not really that good
(umm) The story is kind of blur and drab and it's just so so
So I don't really recommend it
I give it, like, two stars
It's not very good
(umm) Even though there's a lot of, like, famous good actors and actresses (umm) it still doesn't make up for just the bad story
Corbitt here, reviewing the movie Reign of Fire
Reign of Fire is a movie starring Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale and it's about this dragon that's found in the earth and (uhh) basically all hell rains loose when it gets freed, the world is pretty much being destroyed and (umm) {sigh} there's not much to say about this movie
You know, I'm a huge fan of both the stars, Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale
Christian Bale has done a lot of good movies and {sigh} I don't know what happened but (umm) this isn't that good of a movie
(umm) You'd think even these two great actors could save it, but that's not the case
(umm) It's just not that good of an action movie
The conversations with the people are just, like, they don't sound right, they don't sound real
(umm) It seems a little over the top even for having a dragon in it and (umm) it's just not that good
(umm) Surprisingly with this movie they added a lot of extra features including a making of dragons, a pyrotechnics featurette, (uhh) conversations with the director, a trailer, and surround sound
But (umm) I really wouldn't recommend this
I guess if you're a huge dragon fan you might wanna check it out, but (umm) this definitely a pass for me
Hi today I'm reviewing the DVD movie All Dogs Go to Heaven Two
I did not particularly enjoy the first All Dogs Go to Heaven movie, so needless to say I was less than thrilled when my mother in law got my kids this next All Dogs Go to Heaven movie
(umm) My kids really didn't enjoy this one, either, and I didn't
Definitely
It includes the dogs from the first movie, Charlie and Barkin
It does not include the little orphan girl from the first movie Anne Marie
And this movie has a little boy in it, so I guess it would be good (umm) for (umm) little boys to relate to this guy more than the girl in the first one
(umm) (uhh) There's supposed to be a lot of thrills in this movie I didn't find it that thrilling and there's some villains in the movie that kind of make it a little bit dark so I don't really think it's that great for children
(umm) So I definitely would not recommend purchasing this movie, if you have to see it then I would definitely recommend renting it before {laughter} you (umm) spend the money to buy it
Jo Jon: Okay I'm John Brodd, CEO of Cima NanoTech.
I think the geo-political issues certainly have the defining factor certainly in the regional area and it does have a layer of complexity to the financial situation.
Hi
I'm Liz, and I'm here to talk to you about Moonraker
This is a ridiculous movie
(umm) It is the eleventh James Bond film, fourth to star Roger Moore as James Bond
It is available by itself, or as part of the Ultimate Edition Volume Four in the James Bond Collections, this nice silver one
It also contains Octopussy, Tomorrow Never Dies, You Only Live Twice, and Doctor No
This movie, as I say, is completely ridiculous
It's very loosely based on the novel Moonraker by Ian Fleming
(umm) It was actually chosen (uhh) for release at this moment (uhh) in time because of the popularity of Star Wars (stutter) at the time, had been very recent
They originally were going to do For Your Eyes Only as the next film, and they put that off until after, because they wanted to get this out there
That was a really bad idea
(umm) The character of Holly Goodhead yes, that's an actual Bondgirl name, a lot of people think that's a parody or something from Austin Powers no Holly Goodhead, that was her name, is a complete


(umm) She's of course a NASA scientist, because what bond girl wouldn't be? (uhh) She is a total invention of the film
There's no such character in the novel, she's completely ridiculous
Who, who (stutter) on Earth would have, have (stutter) that name and act like that, I don't know
(umm) Apparently, (uhh) she's she's (stutter) quite dull, (uhh) the actress who, who (stutter) played the part
Well, the character's dull
Presumably, the actress, and the entire rest of her family are just as dull, because she claims she's able to convince her grandmother that the name of Goodhead referred to her having a good head on her shoulders, I don't know
(umm) James Bond in Space
How much more ridiculous can you get? I saw this movie on TV when I was about ten, but this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen
Jaws, from the Spy Who Loved Me, (uhh) played by Richard Kiel, is brought back as like a good guy in this for some reason
I guess he was a popular character and they wanted to reuse him, and he has like a love interest with Pigtails, and it's so so very, oh oh it's just upsetting
(umm) It's bad
(stutter) I think there are people who get some sort of sick enjoyment out of this movie, but it's not quite in the so-bad-it's-good category, especially if you are a James Bond fan, it's very painful to watch this at times
On the other hand, if you're a really devoted fan, you need to own this anyway
Hi, my name is Anaj, and today I'm reviewing the DVD of the movie Screwed
Screwed stars (uhh) Norm MacDonald, Dave Chappelle, and Danny DeVito
(uhh) Well nothing much to tell about this movie that, you know, but it's it's (stutter) bad
It's it's (stutter) not good, I mean
So they have tried to make this as a kind of cheesy comedy movie and, you know, something from the team of Saturday Night Live or something like that
(uhh) Got this DVD from a friend and (uhh) watched it
I didn't like it at all
I mean, (uhh) the jokes are kind of old
(uhh) You know, there's not much laughter
I mean you have to kind of make yourself laugh if you have to but there's they have build up a story, it's a little dramatic but (uhh) most of it is old and there's nothing not a new idea in there
(umm) But this DVD has some special features that come along with this movie
There's (uhh) like the production notes, the cast and the filmmakers, and the theatrical trailers
So in fact believe me I preferred the trailers over the movie, that's how bad I (uhh) you know I thought this movie was
Didn't like it at all
Hi
I'm Liz and I'm here to talk to you about Kingpin which is from the guys who brought There's Something About Mary and Dumb and Dumber according to the back of the DVD case which should give you some indication about (uhh) what kind of movie this is
(umm) It stars Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid, and Vanessa Angel, whoever she is
(umm) I saw the trailer for Kingpin many years ago, it was attached to some (uhh) DVD that I watched pretty often and every time I saw it I thought "man that movie looks so stupid"
And then (uhh) I saw that (uhh) my boyfriend owned it and he said "oh you should give it, you should give it a shot
It's (umm) it's a lot funnier than the trailer cause in the trailer they couldn't use a lot of the, you know, more raunchy humor" and it's like okay, fine, you know
I'll give it a chance
When will I learn to trust my instincts? I don't know
Anyway (umm) Kingpin I I (stutter) didn't think was particularly funny
It has a few sort of chuckle moments with kind an aww ending, but other than that no way
Kingpin's not funny to me at all
And (stutter) granted it is a kind of There's Something About Mary, American Pie style of humor that has never appealed to me really (umm) and it's not that it's vulgar because I don't mind that at all, it's that that is what is supposed to be funny about it
If it was a movie like Superbad (umm) which came out recently, very, very funny and it's incredibly vulgar but that's not the basis of the humor
The basis of the humor is the delivery of the line and how people sort of interact with each other
And there's just so much more realism to it and more heart to it and this is just bleh
I don't know
(umm) Bill Murray is in it, (stutter) that might be why
I've never really liked a movie with Bill Murray in it (umm) that I can recall and (uhh) it's not that I have anything against him, I just have never liked him
And maybe he ruined it for me
(umm) Anyway (uhh) to talk really more in detail about this movie Woody Harrelson is a pro bowler who loses his hand, can't bowl anymore, finds a (uhh) naive Amish guy who can bowl really well and his plan is to win some prize money for a bowling tournament using this (umm) this Amish fellow
And of course everyone learns a valuable lesson about not using people or whatever, I don't know
I just don't like this movie and (uhh) I'm sick of talking about it so quite frankly if this kind of movie is your style, (umm) if this is the kind of movie you like and you know if it is then I'm sure you'll love this movie
If you're not a big fan of this type of movie don't even bother
It's not any better than any of the others and (uhh) you'll find it quite dull and unfunny
Hi expotv
My name's Lindsay and I'm here today to talk to you about the DVD movie Stuck on You
This stars Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear as (stutter) conjoined twins (uhh) who are combined, who are adjoined I guess at the liver
Therefore they cannot be separate because they need their liver to survive
(umm) This movie is made by the Farrelly brothers, who also made There's Something About Mary and all I have to say if you like There's Something About Mary you will hate this movie
It is stupid, ridiculous, slapstick, like really cheesy, cheesy lines that they think they're funny and I don't think they're funny
So I really can't recommend this movie {laugh} (umm) but on the DVD it has (umm) a audio comedy by the Farrelly brothers, (uhh) has deleted scenes, a bloopers reel, (uhh) a theatrical teaser and trailer, things like that
(umm) But I don't like this movie (uhh) but you can check it out (uhh) anywhere you buy DVDs
Again it's Stuck on You, the DVD movie starring Greg Kinnear and Matt Damon
Hi ExpoTV, I'm here today to talk to you about the DVD movie Jackass The Movie
(umm) The only part that I could find to play for you was the opening credits because everything else is insanely crude and terrible
And this is the least offensive part that I could find to play
(uhh) So that should tell you something about the movie
This movie is not for children, it is rated R, R, R
Should be rated more if there's rating more than that
(umm) It has a (uhh) restriction on it, it says (uhh) that it is rated R for dangerous sometimes extremely crude stunts, language and nudity, and that is an understatement
(umm) It is raunchy at its best and lots of people getting hurt and doing insane things that you and I would probably never imagine to do, but these guys did
(umm) So if you like that kind of stuff, (uhh) go out and get this movie, (uhh) it is again Jackass The Movie on DVD, and it's rated R for your entertainment
Fred Claus, a current movie in theaters, is about Santa Claus's older brother, Fred Claus, who is forced to move to the north pole
A movie kind of suitable for Christmas and families, but (stutter) ultimately falls flat because Fred Claus just isn't a really good movie
(umm) The actors many of you may know
It's kind of like, a good set of actors but an awful script, bad directing, and the, the story is nothing to really talk about
(umm) The, it's basically a comedy, right? And when you go to see a comedy you expect to laugh, you expect to have a good time, and although Fred Claus is very silly and you shouldn't go in expecting much, it's really not funny
(umm) So I guess I would recommend this only to people who have families that they like to go see it with, and have a decent time
But there's a lot of other comedies out there, even if they're not suited for teenagers and people in their twenties and thirties
(umm) Fred Claus is a movie I definitely do not recommend, unless you're taking children to see it, and with such actors you wouldn't imagine having such a bad script and directing and everything like that
Fred Claus
Hi Expo TV, this is Melissa
You can (umm) check out my profile at PM three two one
I'm here today to review for you the movie Mallrats, directed by Kevin Smith
(umm) {clears throat} This is, you know, got the classic Jay and Silent Bob duo in here, Jason Lee
(umm) Shannen Doherty, Basically there's just a bunch of guys, they just hang out at the mall of the time
(umm) as it says on the front of the (uhh) DVD, they're not there to shop, they're not there to work, they're just there
And that's basically what they do, they just hang out at the mall all the time
They're mallrats
(umm) We do have some good special features
We have feature commentary with the director Kevin Smith, cast members Ben Affleck, Jason Lee, Jason Muse, producer Scott Mosier, and Vincent (uhh) and I can't pronounce his last name, I'm sorry
(umm) over an hour of deleted scenes, live footage from the feature commentary (stutter) session, featurettes, theatrical trailers, (umm) soundtrack presentation, (uhh) by the Goofs Build Me Up Buttercup and production photographs
(umm) once again {clears throat} I'm not really into this (uhh) type of (uhh) genre, I guess (umm) my husband was helping me out and he said, if you give this one a bad review I don't know what to say and I was like well, I didn't say anything, but I'm definitely giving it like a two out of five
Definitely not my cup of tea, but if you like that (uhh) genre then you're gonna like it
Hi, this is Dan with a review of The Golden Compass, available in theaters nationwide
The Golden Compass in my opinion was a turkey
Absolutely thought it was terrible
(umm) Partially probably because I never read the book
(umm) But even so (uhh) if you've seen The Chronicles of Narnia think of The Golden (uhh) Compass providing the action that Chronicles of Narnia missed but none of the story line
(uhh) The Golden Compass spent so much time trying to (uhh) lucidly (uhh) portray and introduce new characters that there was really never any character development, nor do you really get a sense of what was going on
(umm) Basically you have a little girl who ends up going to the north in this fantasy world with friends Iorek, (uhh) which is a ice bear, (umm) played by a (uhh) Ian McKellen's voice and (umm) runs into (uhh) unraveling (uhh) secrets of her past and of her future as she meets a variety of different people
(umm) Unfortunately after she meets all this a brief scuffle occurs and the movie ends all too quickly
(uhh) For example one of the star features in there, who you know, I thought was (uhh) one of the main leads in the movie doesn't even show up for most of the movie, and that would be our friend (uhh) (stutter) Daniel Craig, better known as the new James Bond (umm) who plays a (stutter) major character in this movie
Oh wait, in the next movie in this installment
So it was a big downer, especially since I did not realize, you know, this was the beginning of (uhh) a blockbuster (umm) hit that was supposed to (uhh) go into effect
Well blockbuster it was not
(uhh) Not recommended
We'll see if they continue this terrible series
Would not recommend seeing The Golden Compass in theaters this season
{noise} Hi ExpoTV my name is Lindsey and I am here today to talk to you about the DVD movie A Clockwork Orange
Hello
Today I'm reviewing Munich directed by Steven Spielberg, starring Eric Bana and Daniel Craig (uhh) from the most recent double-oh-seven movie
(uhh) This movie basically is about (uhh) the nineteen-seventy-two (uhh) Olympic massacre of the Israeli (umm) Olympians
(uhh) There were eleven of them that were assassinated and Eric Bana's character (stutter) and a group of (umm) other Israeli soldiers are hired to go and track down the Palestinians (uhh) that are believed to have killed (uhh) these eleven athletes
(umm) And it's really that story (umm) from cradle to grave
It works it from the very beginning all the way through
(umm) I got to say for this to be a Steven Spielberg movie I wasn't really thrilled with it
(umm) Again (stutter) maybe it's just I didn't get it
(uhh) But it was definitely praised by the critics, it actually got (uhh) five Academy Award nominations (umm) when it came out
I didn't like it
(uhh) That doesn't mean that you won't like it, it just means that I didn't like it
I would not recommend this one though
(umm) It's long, it's drawn out, it takes a long time to even get started
(umm) If you like to see random things blow up, well this one might be for you but I I (stutter) really didn't see much plot in it
Very slow
(umm) So I would not recommend this one
Hi, tonight I'm reviewing The Ice Harvest starring Billy Bob Thornton and John Cusack
(uhh) This movie is kind of a crime spoof, (uhh) for lack of a better word
I (uhh) guess you could say a comedic gangster movie
(uhh) Essentially you have John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton who pair up to actually steal money (umm) from a crime boss played by Randy Randy (stutter) Quaid, who actually does a really good job providing some comedic relief (umm) to this one
(uhh) When they steal the money {clears throat} excuse me, they have to go through and do (uhh) go through the night and cross all kinds of stuff
(uhh) Parts of it are really really farfetched
Parts of it are bust your gut funny though
(umm) But it's only small parts
Pretty much what they showed in the previews that looked funny, that's what's gonna be funny in this video
(umm) So not a lot above that
(umm) It does have an alternate ending in the bonus features
(umm) I don't know that it makes it any better though
(uhh) But take a look at that (stutter) alternate ending
Also some outtakes from Billy Bob Thornton, some director's commentary, bloopers, (uhh) things like that
(umm) So if I had to recommend this one I would probably stay away from it just because it's blah
There's nothing to it
(umm) So I would probably not recommend this one
Hello everyone
Playing over my shoulder here is Alien Resurrection, (uhh) and it's a pretty stupid movie
(uhh) The first Alien is a good movie
(uhh) Aliens is a very good movie
Alien three is not so good of a movie, and this is the worst of the four (uhh) in my opinion
(uhh) Sigourney Weaver, who died at the end of Alien three, is (uhh) genetically (uhh) brought back to life so she can star in another sequel that (uhh) tries very, very hard to be funny and just ends up being not funny at all
(umm) It has really good cinematography and a really good visual style the guy who directed it (umm), Jean-Pierre Jeunet, I'm not sure if I pronounced his name properly, I don't speak French, so pardon me, (umm) he also directed (umm) City of Lost Children and Delicatessen and (uhh) Amelie, (uhh) which is a pretty good movie
He directed this and I don't think he spoke English when he directed this, otherwise he may, might might (stutter) have have noticed how terrible a lot of the dialogue in this movie is
(umm) It was written by (umm) Joss Whedon, that's right
He (uhh) wrote, I think, some episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer
I don't know
I really didn't care for this movie
(uhh) It doesn't add anything new to the franchise
(umm) Some of the actors are okay
(umm) Weaver does her best with what she's given, and (uhh) but it really doesn't amount to much in my opinion
(umm) As far as (umm) special features go on this disc, (uhh) the only thing that's on here is (umm) some interviews with the cast and crew, so if you, you know, are looking for some special features, this is not the edition to go for
(umm) I really don't like this movie
Hello
Today I'm reviewing Flight of the Phoenix, starring Dennis Quaid, (uhh) Tyrese Gibson, and (umm) Giovanni Ribisi
(uhh) This movie also has Hugh Laurie in it (uhh) before he became House and really became famous
(uhh) So it's interesting to see him in some of these old roles
(umm) This movie at at (stutter) its core is about (umm) a cargo plane with some mismatched passengers on it
It's flying over a desert, (uhh) runs into a storm and crashes
(uhh) So the survivors that are left are all stranded in this desert and they're trying to find (umm) a way to get out
(umm) The way it ends and the story line of it altogether is really, really, really farfetched
You really have to buy into (uhh) movie magic to go along with this one
(umm) Dennis Quaid (uhh) he used to be a really good actor, all of a sudden it seems like every single movie he's in he has the same exact expressions on his face (umm) so I'm not sure what's going on there but I'm definitely getting tired of seeing his scowl
(umm) Movie not all that great, like I said really, really farfetched
(uhh) When you see the ending, if you ever see the ending, you will probably think it's the stupidest thing you've ever seen before because (uhh) it's it's (stutter) really over the top the way they ended this one
A few (umm) bonus features on this one
(uhh) Some director's commentary, some (stutter) deleted and/or extended scenes, (umm) and some making of the movie documentary diary type (umm) entries
So as far as this one goes I would say definitely (uhh) leave it on the shelf
I probably wouldn't even waste my time to (uhh) to watch it
This one was definitely a disappointment for me
Hello, today I'm reviewing the movie Showtime, starring Robert Deniro and Eddie Murphy
(umm), I gotta say that when I heard Robert Deniro and Eddie Murphy I actually thought it was going to be the funny, one of the funniest things I've ever seen before and it just didn't work
(umm), I don't like this movie
(uhh) Essentially the premise of it is, (umm), Robert Deniro is a, you know, a cop, defined by what you see on television, I mean, just a man's man
He goes out and he, you know, he does what he's supposed to do by the rules
I, he's kind of bully, bullied (stutter) into (umm), participating in a (stutter) reality show
And he's not happy about that, so cameras are following him around night and day, (umm)
On the opposite end of the spectrum you have (stutter) Eddie Murphy's character who's kind of, arrogant, and all about being on TV, (uhh) ready for his time in the spotlight
And (umm), the chemistry between the two as friends just didn't come off
(uhh), Not very funny at all
A couple of one liners here and there
(uhh) But I definitely didn't think it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen
I thought, you know, worth watching, maybe once, and then that was it
(umm) As far as bonus foot, footage (stutter), there is actually some behind-the-scenes footage on here
(umm) The HBO first-look at this movie, (umm) some deleted scenes, some extended scenes, and even a blooper real, but even those things really don't help this movie out
So, for me, this one's only gonna pull a one out of five stars
If you can see it for free, I'd see it for free
Hello, today I'm reviewing the movie A Bronx Tale, starring Robert De Niro and (stutter) Chazz Palmintiri
(uhh) This movie is actually the directorial debut (uhh) by Robert De Niro
(umm) It's classic De Niro in the fact that it's kind of got a mafia overlay in everything that's going on
(uhh) Essentially Chazz Palmintiri is a crime boss and Robert De Niro is a bus driver, so you have two opposite sides of the tracks and in between these two gentlemen is Robert De Niro's son who is seeing the best of both worlds
(umm) He has his father that has everyone's respect because he earned it, but he has to work hard for it and he sees the crime boss who has everybody's respect because they're all scared to death of him
(umm) So he gets to see both sides of the story and has to make a decision on which way he's gonna go with it
(umm) It's a very very good movie
(umm) One that kind of makes you think
(uhh) you can sit back, you can enjoy it and for a directorial debut it's definitely impressive on the side of Robert De Niro
(umm) A couple of bonus features, not a whole lot
(uhh) Just some cast bios, (uhh) it's dubbed in multiple language and (uhh) multiple languages and (uhh) it has the original theater trailer
(uhh) So nothing big there, just a couple of things
But definitely one that you want to add to your collection, especially if you are a gangster (uhh) movie fan
Hello, today I'm reviewing the movie Vanity Fair starring Reese Witherspoon
(uhh) This movie is a Focus Features release which means it's an independent film (umm) and you can really tell this is an indie film
(umm) It may just be me but I didn't get this one
(umm) I love Reese Witherspoon
I think, you know, she does a great job in acting
Love Sweet Home Alabama, (umm) all those movies
This one was kind of horrible for me
Essentially she plays a girl who is poor
She's down and out on her luck and decides to lie and cheat her way into another English class during the eighteen-hundreds
(umm) Of course, you know, along the way she ends up meeting a guy and things, you know, one thing leads to another and (umm) that gets in the way of what she's trying to do
(umm) so really the basic story that's already been told
We've seen it before
It's just she did not pull this role off
(umm) The movie, I didn't like the writing, I didn't like the premise behind it
(uhh) Definite only a one out of five stars for me
(umm) (stutter) Few special features on this one
A look at the women behind Vanity Fair
(umm) Some director's commentary, some deleted scenes and even a behind the scenes look at the movie
(uhh) But even those bonus features aren't going to make it any better
We're looking at one out of five stars on this one
If I were a rich man
{singing} You ever wonder where that came from? It's not Gwen Stefani, If I Were a Rich Girl
{singing} This is the original
It's the film of course
(umm) My parents have both seen this (uhh) multiple, multitudes of times in actual, like, play form
So, my dad bought this for my mom
I had never seen it before until this film, so, I was not let down
It is very well done
(umm) It has a lot to do with Jewish culture and things like that
(umm) Some other great songs besides the (uhh) If I were a rich man song is (uhh) matchmaker, matchmaker make me a match
(umm) Yeah
It's it's (stutter) a great story
It's it's (stutter) one of those movies that until you see it you really can't describe it
(umm) It's described as the most powerful movie ever made
I wouldn't, (umm) (stutter) movie musical ever made
I wouldn't say that, because I really like Phantom
However, it was really good
It's one of those must-sees
(umm) I really liked this movie and I would recommend it to everyone as, (uhh) like, who's a fan of musicals or is a fan of just Jewish culture or who just wants to see a really good movie
This is the widescreen special edition version of Underworld: Evolution
Starring Kate Beckinsale, it's the sequel to the hit movie Underworld
In which she plays a vampire
(uhh) And in this (stutter) movie she has to fight a new group of (uhh) vampire werewolf hybrids which are trying to take over the world
(umm) Movie wasn't that great
(uhh) on the DVD the best (uhh) comment they can get is explosive entertainment from someone at FoxTV so they know, (uhh) wasn't that well received
But Kate Beckinsale looks fantastic in this movie
She's super hot and you'll enjoy the movie for that aspect
(uhh) In terms of the DVD features it does have (stutter) a few special features (uhh) directors and filmmakers commentary
A few documentaries about (stutter) how the visual effects were made, how the stunts were made
(uhh) How the creatures were thought up
Hi, I'm Liz and I'm here to talk about Manos: The Hands of Fate
Quite possibly the worst movie ever made
I think it's a great candidate for it (umm) because it is generally so bad that it cannot be enjoyed
It is, it is (stutter) like sour milk
No matter which way you swirl it in your mouth it's just, it's just (stutter) awful
(umm) Manos I think is a better candidate for the title than, say, Plan Nine From Outer Space which you can actually watch and enjoy
Manos is nearly unwatchable and I think the only, the only decent excuse for watching it is either watching the episode of Mystery Science Theater or being Quentin Tarantino (stutter) and enjoying it for some reason
(umm) He's clearly demented
(umm) Manos is (umm) The story about some (uhh) it doesn't make any sense
(uhh) There there's (stutter) a guy called the master who's played by this (uhh) menacing fellow here, who played a trucker kind of (umm) who (uhh) owns a house and (umm) a very strange satyr named (uhh) named (uhh) Torgo takes care of it for him
You can't really tell that Torgo's a satyr because you don't see his hooves so he just looks like a guy with very large knees and walks funny
(umm) Incidentally the guy who played Torgo killed himself a few months after the film was released
(uhh) Family members and friends believe it was unrelated but I'm not so sure
(umm) A a (stutter) vacationing family runs across this house, basically (umm) fall under this spell, this strange cult that owns the, I don't know
It doesn't make any sense, it's ridiculous, it's hilarious and yet a little creepy at the same time
(umm) Which of course is the intent seeing as it is a horror movie, yet (uhh) the creepiness just kind of adds to the badness of it somehow and (uhh) it it (stutter) overall it's a very unlikable {sigh} movie
Although the lore about it is (umm) is fantastic
(umm) If you just go online and read about this movie it's it's (stutter) quite interesting and hilarious how it came to be
(umm) And (uhh) that's really the only good thing about it is the sort of cult following that is has, the movie itself is just awful
And it's even more unbearable to watch this uncut version
You know, watching Mystery Science Theater is bad enough
(uhh) This version's even worse, it's just this long sequences of nothing and (umm) I don't know what they were thinking when they made this
(uhh) It was made by a fertilizer salesman so take that for what it's worth
Hi today I'm reviewing the DVD movie Rush Hour Three
This movie like the previous two Rush Hour movies stars Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker
This one actually takes place in Paris
(umm) They're after a Chinese mastermind, there's (uhh) lots of action in this movie (umm) I did not find this Rush Hour Three to be as funny as the other two Rush Hour movies
I really think they should've stopped at the first one because in my opinion they kind of got progressively worse after the first one
(umm) If you are just (umm) (uhh) diehard fan of the Rush Hour series and just wanna see what happens next then that's probably the only person that I would recommend this DVD to
(uhh) (umm) Otherwise I just really wouldn't waste your time, it just did not measure up to the first two movies at all (umm) (uhh) especially the first one
Hi
Today I'm reviewing the DVD movie Sweet November
This movie is a romantic movie
It stars Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron, and Charlize Theron plays a woman who just kind of wants to escape through life, escape to relationships, not having any strings attached
(umm) So she invites men into her life for one month only and Keanu Reeves just happens to be her November man and (umm) well it's kind a cheesy romantic movie
I really didn't enjoy it that much
(umm) A lot of parts of it were very predictable and (umm) I for the most part like romantic movies, but this one I just thought it was really a little bit too cheesy
(umm) It it's (stutter) just really, really predictable
You can't, I mean, like most romantic movies (umm) not really a lot to (umm) the plot and I just really didn't enjoy it that much
So (umm) if you're a real sap and really like romantic movies, any kind, then check it out
But if not then don't waste your time
Hi I'm here reviewing Aliens versus Predator: Requiem
This is the sequel to Alien Versus Predator which came out two years ago
(umm) This movie, it was, I, it was a pretty good horror movie
(uhh) There were a lot of frightening parts
I know but this whole alien versus predator thing is just way too commercialized
(uhh) I felt like it's not doing justice to the original Alien, the original Predator movies
(uhh) In this movie, a predator lands on earth to kill the aliens that escape from the ship at the end of the last movie
And (uhh) couple of new things in this movie, there's a pred-alien combination predator alien that's kind of a, cheesy and expected (uhh) you know, next step for this franchise
And some of you were just kind of cheesy
I don't like the whole Alien versus Predator franchise
But it was you know, an entertaining horror movie if you're just looking to have a good time
Not really looking for you know, very well done movie
I guess this movie will do
I'm personally gonna give it a two out of five
I don't think it ever deserves more than that
Hi, (umm) so Expo
Time to review a movie
(umm) I really like Hilary Swank, I think she's a great actress and I think she was fantastic in Boys Don't Cry
I didn't see the boxing movie cuz (uhh) I just heard that it was too grim
But (umm) I thought she was tremendous in Boys Don't Cry, so I really wanted to see what she was up to
So I went to see P

I Love You
Here's my little thingy
Alright
Let me be frank
She's just not sort of a romantic heroine in my mind
(umm) It's a sort of sickly sweet love story about a a (stutter) woman whose (umm) husband dies and leaves her letters that (umm) try to help her get back into life
And you know, it's a sweet idea and it was definitely worth seeing if you're looking for something (umm) kind of schmaltzy {laughter} but (umm) I'd recommend waiting for the DVD or (umm) yeah
Definitely it's more of a renter
And she just doesn't have the (uhh) sort of, romantic heroine look
I found her kind of (uhh) harsh and (umm) it just didn't capitalize on her strengths
So not a highly recommended movie, probably like a two star movie
Hi my name is Anesh and today I'm reviewing the movie Aliens versus Predators requiem which is currently running in theaters nationwide
(uhh) Now this movie is a sequel of the earlier movie and (uhh) sorry to say but it's not as good in fact it's terrible and I rate this movie two on five to start with
(uhh) The movie is the same you know there's this war between the predators and aliens there's only one predator (uhh) left on earth and you know he contacts the base station and then ask for backup (uhh) there lots of (uhh) you know, action sequences
(uhh) But none as good as the one that would and you know, in the earlier movie
This one is you know disappointing the scenes repeat again and again
(uhh) The same kind of action and you you (stutter) would not expect them to come up with something new something different that would actually gather the attention of the audience make it more interesting but (uhh) nothing that you can see in this movie
(umm) Really disappointing, (uhh) two on five again and (uhh) you know if you're really big (stutter) fan of sci-fi these kind of movies go to theaters otherwise you know just wait and maybe watch it on DVD later on
(umm) Totally not recommended at all
Hi expo
So I think I finally hit the wall, movie wise
(umm) I (stutter) you know, I was thinking "okay, Diane Keaton, (uhh) (uhh) Queen Latifah, Katie Holmes, how bad can it be?" You know? Diane Keaton's awesome, and Queen Latifah is totally cool, and Katie Holmes she's cute
Okay, here are the good things I can say about this movie
(uhh) They all had really good hair and (uhh) it was nice to see Katie Holmes with a man her own age {laugh}
I wish I could take credit for that comment but (uhh) somebody else said it
(uhh) So anyway (umm) I'm talking about Mad Money
Really not a great movie
In fact I think it speaks to the moral bankruptcy of our culture {laugh} and my own bad taste that I would go to this movie
So (uhh) I can't begin to tell you how bad I think this movie is, and I'm really sorry because it actually could have been kind of good
So (uhh) I'll give it one star for (uhh), actually half a star for their hair, (uhh) everybody had good hair, and (uhh) half a star for (uhh) Katie Holmes' dancing
But that's about it
Hi
Today I'd like review Bee Movie, which is an animated movie currently in theaters
This is (uhh) written by Jerry Seinfeld and it stars Jerry Seinfeld and Rene Zellweger, or the voices of them cause it's computer animated
(umm) But this is an okay movie but overall I just found it to be not very interesting, like I didn't see the point
It wasn't any different than all those other animated movies about bugs or toys or stuff like that
(umm) I love, you know, Toy Story and Ratatouille and most of the Pixar movies (umm) but this was just really generic and maybe it had a few funny one liners and Seinfeld was his normal self, but (uhh) overall I just didn't see the point
I mean besides the good animation (umm) I really can't recommend it unless you have little kids cause they'd probably enjoy it, but other than that not a great movie
So I give Bee Movie a four out of ten
Hi
I am here to review the movie Platinum Blonde
(umm) This is a movie directed by Frank Capra (uhh) starring Jean Harlow
(uhh) This is a movie about a (uhh) newspaper reporter, hard working, lower class, honest to the fault, newspaper reporter investigating (umm) something that happen in a rich family (uhh) who with their (stutter) daughter Jean Harlow
(uhh) The Jean Harlow character (uhh) (stutter) seduces (uhh) the young innocent (uhh) crusading (uhh) newspaper reporter and (uhh) also in this movie we have the young Loretta Young who is incredibly beautiful and our intrepid reporter for whatever reason ignores her
(uhh) The problem I have with this movie is, despite how old I look, Jean Harlow is before my time and I don't sense the appeal of the Jean Harlow
(umm) big west was before my time and I can see her appeal and what she meant to the audience and why men were intrigued by her (uhh) and as far as Frank Frank (stutter) Capra goes, he has made much better movies after Platinum Blonde
Good evening, ExpoTV
Tonight I'm going to be reviewing the DVD three hundred
Right here, I have the two-disc special edition
It's a very good movie
It's a story (uhh) about {sigh} King (stutter) Leonidas and (uhh) his battle with three hundred Spartan warriors
It's a titanic crash and (uhh) definitely makes for a good movie
(umm) Pete Hammond from Maxim says it's a "spectacular visual feast that is inventive and groundbreaking
" Those are noble words about a movie right there
(umm) Like I said, it's about King Leonidas taking on three hundred Spartans
We have some special features here
We have additional scenes that (uhh) they're going to say, you also have commentary with those scenes
They're going to tell you why they don't have those scenes in the movie, why they made the scenes originally, but didn't end up putting them in the movie
We also have Frank Miller's vision realized on film with three hundred Spartans
Fact or fiction
The shocking life of a Spartan
And actual Spartan, they tell you about the life of them
We also have Who Were the Spartans? A little look into how they how they (stutter) casted for the characters that play the Spartans in this movie
This movie is rated R
It's got some graphic battle sequences throughout and some sexuality and nudity
Not stuff you're going to want your kids seeing
It's a bloody mess at points
There's sexual stuff going on
Definitely a good movie for adults, though
I'm going to rank it one of the best out there
I'm going to give it five out of five stars
I'm going to suggest that you definitely pick up three hundred
Do not forget those words
Expotv, how you doing? Nick B here
Today I'm going to be reviewing the DVD The Silence of the Lambs with Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, and Scott Glenn
This is the (uhh) special edition DVD here that I am reviewing tonight
It is (uhh) a great movie
It, it (stutter) won an Oscar for best picture in nineteen-ninety-one
It is rated R, it's a very disturbing movie, not anything you want to let your kids see
I saw this when I was a kid, it gave me bad dreams for weeks
So definitely, definitely keep this for the grownups
(uhh) The approximate run time on here is an hour and fifty-eight minutes and like I said it came out in nineteen-ninety-one
The DVD is in color
We have some great special features here on it
We have a brand new inside the labyrinth documentary including all the interviews with the cast, featuring Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster, and more
We also have twenty minutes worth of deleted scenes, that's a lot of extra footage there for you to watch
We have the original making of from nineteen-ninety-one, we have Anthony Hopkins phone message, we have a never before seen outtake reel, we have a photo gallery, collectible booklet that comes with this DVD
I keep mine right here inside the DVD, I don't want to lose my (stutter) collectible booklet
I keep it where I know where it's gonna be
We also have teaser trailers, TV spots and more
Very, very good movie
Very, very interesting to watch
It keeps you on the edge of your seat, you never know what's gonna happen next
Hannibal Lecter is one twisted character and this movie's all about him
(uhh) I'm going to give Silence of the Lambs five out of five stars, I'm going to recommend that you see it out there expotv
Hi Expo this is Nicki
This is my review on (stutter) Johnson Family Vacation movie
(umm) I thought this was not all that great
(umm) I expected a lot more out of it
(umm) Especially with Cedric the Entertainer
And don't get me wrong, there's some funny parts in it
But overall, I think my expectations of it really were a lot higher than what I got
(umm) It's rated PG-thirteen for crude humor, so forth
(umm) And it's ninety-six minutes long
(umm) I think towards the end I was just really hoping it would end pretty quick
(umm) It's (umm) got Bow Wow, Steve Harvey, (uhh) Cedric the Entertainer, (umm) Vanessa Williams, just to name a few of the actors that are in this movie
But (umm) I, I (stutter) mean I would check it out it's not a bad movie, I'd probably give this a two and a half
(umm) But (uhh) some funny parts in it, so check it out
Hi expo
{clears throat} This is Nikki
This is my review on My Date with Drew
(umm) Don't waste your time
This is a terrible movie
(umm) A guy (umm) who's had this lifelong (uhh) crush on Drew Barrymore (umm) decides twenty years later that he's going to make his dream come true and go on a date
Okay, that's all I'll say, but that's all that matters
(uhh) It's terrible
It's actually terrible
It's not funny, it's not interesting
(umm) I'm actually kind of sad I own this movie but anyway (umm) it's ninety minutes long, it's rated PG
(umm) Who knows? Somebody might like it
(uhh) I wouldn't recommend it
I'd probably give this one a one, if that
So (umm) if you're wanting to see a terrible movie just to see how bad movies can get, (uhh) this would be the one to check out
(uhh) My Date with Drew
Hi
I'm Liz and I'm here to talk to you about The Rules of Attraction
This is a movie that was based upon a novel by Bret Easton Ellis who of course wrote American Psycho
(umm) and also this
(uhh) Wow
I hated this movie
And I like American Psycho a lot
I think it's, I think it's (stutter) very good and (umm) There
I could not hate this movie any more
Well, I could probably hate it more
But (umm) I don't want to think about how I could hate it anymore
(uhh) because my head will explode
(umm) Apparently, Time Magazine asked, What more could you want in a movie
Well, I'd like a movie that isn't completely (uhh) disturbing, disjointed, uninteresting, doesn't engage me with the characters, (umm) doesn't really have much of a plot, and just kind of meanders around
This supposed, you know, world of, of, of (stutter) college, that isn't really like any actual college environment anywhere and I hate that I hate that (stutter) stories that we're supposed to accept as like a dead on satire of how we live, when they're completely off base
I don't like that
And (umm) I don't know if it's how these how these (stutter) writers, Bret Easton Ellis, if that how he perceived, perceived, I don't know, I assume he went to college
I don't know if that's how he perceived it or if that's how he believes it is now
(umm) I don't know how much of course it was all through the movie, because I couldn't get through it
I love American Psycho, and I'm certainly not going to try Rules of Attraction
(umm) I don't really know what it was that disturbed me so much about this movie
It just annoyed me
Part of it was (umm) the lead, James Van Der Beek, (umm) who plays Patrick Bateman's (uhh) brother
(uhh) It's just awful
He's (uhh) not charismatic at all
The total opposite of, of (stutter) Christian Bale
He's completely uncharismatic
He's so bland and uninteresting
Not a good actor
Kind of (umm) upsetting, not interesting at all
(umm) And maybe maybe (stutter) I suppose it's possible, that the whole point of (umm) this movie is just to unsettle you and make you not like it
(uhh) Maybe maybe (stutter) I'm just missing that, but I felt like the behavior of these characters was completely out of touch with reality and that I don't find that interesting or attractive in a movie
So (umm) (uhh) you may like Rules of Attraction
(umm) But I can't quite conceive of liking it
I'm sitting here holding the DVD
Apparently my boyfriend liked it enough to buy it
I'm going to have to have a talk with him about that
(umm) This, this (stutter) just really (uhh) I just, I beg you don't go into it like I did, thinking Oh I loved American Psycho, I'm gonna love this
It's a totally different creature and you might not like it at all
Hello I'd like to tell you about a movie that I recently saw
This is a Bee Movie starring Jerry Seinfeld
(uhh) This has a list of characters in here, there's Kathy Bates, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Richards, (uhh) Chris Rock, Ray Liotta, the list goes on and on and on
There are so many cameos of voices that you cannot keep up with them
(umm) Actually I wrote them down because there's so many, Rip Torn, Larry Miller, (umm) Patrick Warburton, Larry King who often plays cameos
(uhh) This bee (uhh) is called Barry bee
He (uhh) is the voice of, (uhh) is Jerry Seinfeld
He breaks rule number one, he talks to people
And so he actually talks to a florist, she saves his life and therefore she helps him find a lawyer who (uhh) basically he's going to sue humans for stealing his bee honey and from then on people are worried, the bees are worried that he's going to with people and his mother at at least (stutter) talking to the woman, that he's talking to his bee life or bee-ish
I thought that was kind of cute
There are so many actors and actresses in this it could have been so good, it could have been like Ratatouille but it wasn't
So that's all I have to say for it there's a lot of one liners and they absolutely hit flat bottom they're not funny
So this is not a kid's movie, it's an adults movie, it's a Jerry Seinfeld movie Jerry could do better
Hello, I'd like to tell you about Untraceable
It's a movie I've seen recently starring Diane Lane, Billy Burke, and (uhh) Colin Hanks
Colin Hanks is (uhh) the son of Tom Hanks, and he's been in quite a few movies but until recently he has (uhh) had very small roles
(uhh) He is a very good actor and I was glad to see him in this movie
As far as the movie, it's about (uhh) the FBI, the the (stutter) special unit that investigates murder plots or any types of crime on the internet
Welcome to the agents of cyberspace, where (uhh) Diane Lane who is a special investigator for the FBI
(uhh) Actually, (umm) (uhh) she plays as Jennifer Marsh and her coworker is Colin Hanks
They come across a very (uhh) terrible website where a predator actually kills his victims and it's up to the (uhh) audience, or the people that work with him on the internet because the more hits he gets (uhh) by people watching the crimes, the faster the people die
It's a very gory plot, he shows (stutter) (umm) some terrible scenes, some graphic, terrible, awful scenes
They're not entertaining, they're gross, they're not really meant to be seen
(uhh) It's sickening, it's a sicko movie
It's, there's nothing about it that's good
(uhh) It's, the movie, first of all the plot is not plausible
Second of all (umm) (uhh) Jennifer Marsh, or Diane Lane, comes across a website of I believe it was called (uhh) kill with me dot com and it actually shows a starving cat
The cat has actually been starved to death
It shows another scene where a person is bound and it has the the (stutter) person's name branded on the person's chest, and it just gets worse and worse and worse
This movie actually is pitiful
(umm) It's not scary, it's sick, and you're going to have nightmares if you watch it
Some people gave it a two, a few people were generous with a one, some people even dared put down one and a half, I'm not even gonna give it a twinkle
Name is Mike and this is my ExpoTV review of the film Meet the Spartans, which is basically a spoof, primarily of the (uhh) the movie three hundred
(umm) The film doesn't have a lot of what you'd call really big stars
(uhh) I think the closest (uhh) big star that they have in there is Carmen Electra and only a couple parts of her are big
(umm) The, this movie is pretty much a waste of time
It's a spoof movie sort of like a Scary Movie (umm) and (uhh) the Airplane movies, where just it's a lot of (uhh) fast paced quick one liners and things along that nature
(umm) Overall, I can't give it a good recommendation
(umm) Most of the jokes were pretty predictable
(umm) There was an unfortunate situation where that Chris Crocker guy who says "leave Britney alone" is in the movie with a clip and then that pretty much sort of sold me on (uhh) the fact that this was pretty much a bad movie
So (umm) they (uhh) they probably maybe will do a sequel to this
Hopefully they won't
But if you're (uhh) looking for a good movie to see this weekend or next weekend (uhh) this is one to definitely avoid
Hi, Expo
This is Melissa
You can check out my profile and my reviews at PM three two one to see what I have been talking about lately
{Cough} Excuse me
We are talking about today Naked Gun thirty three and a half: The Final Insult
And I agree, this is horrible
It is a final insult
(umm) The first two movies, I hated
This one, I hated even worse
So my husband and I were just joking around that if there was an option on Expo, I would click a zero out of five
But there's not, so I had to go with one out of five
It's that bad
(umm) Created by the Zucker brothers, we have the whole gang back again, Leslie Nielsen, Priscilla, Priscilla (stutter) Presley, O

Simpson
This time, you have Anna Nichole Smith, which they (umm) in the previews, say her name over and over and over again
They must be so excited that she's given them her presence
But she doesn't do the best job acting in this at all
(umm) Basically, you have Lt
Frank Drevin, who is stopping a terrorist plot that could mean curtains for him, or will a simple simple (stutter) window shade be enough? (umm) Basically, we have a state of the art advance and sequel numbering are the filmmakers you love, the returning stars you adore, plus others
(umm) We have Fred Ward, Anna Nichole Smith, as I said, (umm) O

Simpson, just everybody from the Police Squad Files
(umm) It's just not a movie I would (uhh) spend my five dollars on, basically
Hi guys
(uhh) my name is xxx and today I'll be talking about the movie Hitman
(uhh) this movie was released last year and it's about an agent who in the, in this (stutter) film (uhh) the name of the agent if forty-seven
(umm) whose role is being played by Timothy Ol Olyphant (stutter) and he he's (stutter) basically (umm) kind of an agent who works on the other (umm) so and he he (stutter) like he is in a xxx of control and russian (uhh) kind, russian agents because (umm) he was like (uhh) he was about to kill (uhh) president and what (uhh) he was being seen by one of the witness
So he chased him and so this movie was quite (uhh) full of techno stuff and was kind of a blue movie where like things moved sometimes fast and sometimes slow but I would just say this movie was just an average movie and I'm going to give this movie like (umm) maybe two out five
Today I'm going to review One Missed Call, and this is a new horror kind of movie that I guess is most similar to similar to (stutter) horror movies like The Ring The Ring (stutter), which was centered around a video tape
This one's obviously centered around a cell phone and one missed call
Now these movies, they seem to, (stutter) like they're not really gonna stand the test of time
Like you know thirty years from now most people aren't going to really remember this movie
And (uhh) yeah, no one's really going to think it's is the best movie of all time
And (uhh) unfortunately you know that's the case
(uhh) Some people might wanna check it out for like (uhh) a popcorn kind of flick
Just see it once in theaters, or maybe rent it (uhh) you know, for a night time viewing and (uhh) see if you can get scared essentially
(uhh) Is it an entertaining movie? That depends on what you (uhh) what your tastes are essentially
If you found movies like a Jeepers Creepers or (uhh) Final Destination to be entertaining, you might find One Missed Call to be entertaining as well
If you're looking for a well done kind of horror movie (uhh) you know, with goo (stutter) with high production values and stuff like that (uhh) you know, I would recommend something like The Shining or even The Ring more so than this
So it really depends on your tastes and how much you're interested in the horror kind of (uhh) thriller suspense genre
This is my review of Walt Disney's Beauty and the Beast
(uhh) This is the special edition two disc platinum edition
(uhh) This is probably my all time favorite Disney princess movie
(umm) I watch this with my daughters
(uhh) They all love it, even my seven year old still really liked it
She can still watch it over and over again
(uhh) And looking forward to watching it with my two year old as well
(umm) A lot of the neat features on the two disc (umm) version are (uhh) there's a Celine Dion and xxx music video
There's never before released behind the scenes footage
(uhh) There's some games and (uhh) there are three different versions of the film
(uhh) You do get a lot of extra stuff by buying the platinum edition
And (uhh) But really the best part is the classic Beauty and the Beast movie
(umm) Definitely can't go wrong with this one
It's wonderful animation and the cutest characters and (uhh) really really good music
(uhh) My favorite songs are in this movie from (uhh) out of all the Disney princess movies
So (uhh) definitely one of our favorites in our Disney library and I highly recommend it
Hello, my name is Sarah and I will be doing my video opinion of the Walt Disney movie Underdog
(umm) This was absolutely my favorite movie (umm) of, of (stutter) the year (umm) I really enjoyed this movie
(umm) Basically the title says underdog, the movie was about a canine who had an accident in a lab with (umm) a doctor (uhh) a mad scientist, and end up getting the ability to talk and have the ability to have all these great superpowers
(umm) He can run really fast, and he do these really cool flips, (umm) you know it was just a lot of different things that you know, a basic superhero might have you know, strength, speed
Basically the dog had it
(uhh) He end up coming across a (umm) family who took him in
And (umm) you know, basically he was just going around town and and (stutter) saving people and and (stutter) you know, trying to understand what he was going through and the abilities that he had
Trying to figure out how they worked and what to do with them
(umm) This movie was just unbelievable (stutter) it was hilarious, it was family, it was friend, you know you can watch it with friends, family, (umm) all ages
(umm) It made you laugh so I really enjoyed this movie
All of this other stuff is irrelevant
And if you want to talk about that stuff, but you're not focusing your time on ministering to others or witnessing or explaining the Gospel to other people, you're wasting time
We don't have time for these irrelevant controversies that detract from the Good News of the Gospel
People are breaking my brain because you'll go onto any Christian YouTube channel
You'll go onto any Christian Website and you'll have somebody who is ready to fight, "Oh, what are your thoughts about flat earth
" "What do you think about Flat Earth
" "If you don't believe in Flat Earth, you're not a Christian
This is What Women Want, with Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt
This is supposed to be a very romantic comedy, but I find it to be ridiculous and stupid
(umm) Don't rent this or buy it or ever watch it, ever, ever, ever, because it's dumb
And if you are dumb then you can watch it and you can be like, oh I like this movie
But if you're not dumb, you'll stay away from it because it's stupid
(uhh) It's PG-thirteen
It's a hundrend-and-twenty-six minutes long
(umm) Mel Gibson (umm) is trying to (uhh), he's in advertising and he's trying to (umm) think like a woman and he (umm) so he's dresses like a woman and whatnot, and he ends up getting like electrocuted or something, and (umm) he can hear what women think, and (umm) (uhh) so he uses that to be able to (umm) woo Helen Hunt's character
And then he finds that he really does love her
Hi, I'm Valerie, and today I'll be reviewing the film Saving Private Ryan
(umm) It's starring Tom Hanks and it's winner of five Academy Awards
It's a very very amazing movie
(umm) It takes place during (uhh) one of the World Wars and (umm) Tom Hanks, he's in the military and he is sent on a mission to save this (uhh) Private Ryan, who is still out in the (uhh) war zone
And so they have to locate him and bring him back
And so (umm) along the way they encounter all these different scenarios and you really see (umm) a very realistic glimpse of what the war was actually like, the end and stuff
It's very very (uhh) realistic, powerful war type movie
So if you're interested in films like this, and even if you're not, it's definitely worth giving it a chance
(umm) I really enjoy this movie and it's a very very nice film
(umm) It even has a some special features
(umm) It has an exclusive message from Steven Spielberg, he's the director of this film, and (uhh) they have the cast and filmmakers bios
So, it's really fun to see, you know, what other films these actors have worked on
So, the special features are also very fun
Hi guys, (uhh) my name is Sumit and today I'll be talking about the latest released movie, One Missed Call
(uhh) This movie was released few weeks back and (uhh) it was not not (stutter) (uhh) good movie
It was supposed to be horror, but it's not that good a horror movie
(uhh) This is origin (stutter) (uhh) basically (uhh) movie release in Japan (uhh) in two-thousand-three and this is a remake (umm)
It's an English version of that movie
(uhh) This movie starts with a story that a few people get a call or get a voicemail that how they died
Like what time, what date, what place (uhh) in their previous life and they got horrified and then some sudden deaths happen and they're all like surprised and too scared to tell everyone, And then they (umm) there was a spirit, (uhh) some sort of, in this movie, so
I didn't like this movie much, so I'm going to give this movie like two out of five
Hello and welcome to my review of the movie at the theater (uhh) Bee Movie
(uhh) this is an animated film done by Jerry Seinfeld and (umm) apparently Jerry Seinfeld was working on this movie for a few years, (uhh) since he's been finished with the Seinfeld show and so I was expecting a lot more out of this movie
(uhh) overall I was very disappointed in the movie
(uhh) I thought it would be more along the lines of maybe a Shrek where it would be a movie that the kids would like but the adults would like too
(uhh) however it's much more for the kids which was really surprising (uhh) considering it was Jerry Seinfeld (uhh) Chris Rock
Another thing I didn't like about the movie is (uhh) it was kind of billed in the previews that Chris Rock was, you know, the co-star of the movie but I mean he literally probably has ten lines in the entire film and (uhh) just nothing earth shattering so (uhh) overall I was very disappointed in Bee Movie
(uhh) your kids may like it but (uhh) it it's (stutter) just not a movie for adults, there's no you know a lot of kid's movies are do some clever things that (uhh) you know some double entendres, you know, things like adult humor slid into a kid's movie
Hi, I am reviewing the movie Eragon, which is currently in theaters
Now I was a, I'm a fan of fantasy movies so when I saw some of the commercials for this I thought alright, I'm gonna go check this movie out
If you you're (stutter) a fan of fantasy movies, or any type of movie for that matter do not see this movie
It was a horrible ripoff of The Lord of The Rings
(umm) It was just a mess
The dialogues were horrible, performances were (stutter) awful if you ask me
(umm) I thought, I don't understand how some people could approve this movie and put it out for production, it was just awful
(umm) I'd say about halfway through the movie, I had enough, I had to walk out
People before me were walking out of this movie
So you know, even little kids with parents were leaving this movie
That's how bad I thought it was and (stutter) apparently other people thought it was too
So you know, if you're looking for a movie to see, then do not see this one, because it will disappoint and you will lose your money
Expo I'm gonna talk about the movie Fred Claus
(umm) It's still in theaters, I don't know if it is or not and (umm) it stars Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti
Vince Vaughn you really disappointed me with this one
He usually, Vince Vaughn's a hilarious guy
In Fact, that's why I went to see the movie, cause Vince Vaughn's in it
And that's why I guarantee a lot of people went to see the movie cause they thought Vince Vaughn was in it, it's probably funny
It's probably a hilarious movie
But it's really not that funny
It's really kind of a stupid movie
I mean, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen but it is it is (stutter) not that great of a movie at all
(uhh) I wouldn't recommend seeing it (uhh) in theaters
I wouldn't recommend paying full price
If you wanted to wait until it came out on DVD I I (stutter) would I suggest doing that
But if you didn't see it at all in general, no, no (stutter) harm no foul
I mean seriously, it's not that great of a movie
So basic plot, (umm) Vince Vaughn is, his name's Fred, and he is the older brother of Santa Claus and they have the whole family thing you know cause he's brothers and they got parents and then this whole dramatic structure of how their in a relationship with family and how Fred's supposed to be more like (stutter) Santa Claus, which is his brother
But his his name's Nick, obviously you know Saint Nicholas, his name's Nick
So It's this whole family kind of comedy thing about how they how they don't get along and then (stutter) the main plots really about how you know Fred (stutters) he should be more like his brother and how but Fred kinda keeps messing up with his brother and like he marks everybody on the on the (stutter), he believes everybody shouldn't get a president present (stutter) on Christmas and I mean, it's just it's just crazy stupid
It's just stupid, okay
It's really not that funny
I don't even know what I was saying when it was a decent movie
It's really stupid
In fact just thinking about it just makes me mad because I went to go see it and Vince Vaughn really disappointed me and I hope his next movie's not like that cause if his next movie's like that, I'm gonna be disappointed and his Wild Wild West show just came out recently and I'm not gonna go see it because of that
You disappointed me and I don't know, you know
So, I don't know, Vince Vaughn you disappointed me
But the movie's not that great, okay
It's terrible
Expo, I'm gonna get really insane about this one
I'm gonna do a review here on Meet the Spartans
Somebody kill me now, who keeps making these movies? Seriously
Who keeps making these movies
They're terrible
Don't go see it
If somebody comes up to you and is like, hey, you wanna go see the movie for free? I'll pay you to go see the movie
Don't go see it, it's not worth it
It's not worth it, you'll question life
You'll seriously question living
Seriously it's terrible, it is terrible
Okay it's another one of these movies that parodies movies and it's just stupid
You think they would have learned this after all the scary movies, what they made like four already? They made four Scary Movies and made this epic, epic (stutter) movie, they made this date movie
And this is supposedly one of the sequels to like epic movie I think
But they had to be, call it, they had to call it Meet the Spartans because every movie did so bad
Just, just stop making the movies
Just stop making them
Okay come up with something more original than copying other people or trying to make fun of them
It's just stupid
So, it just made me so mad just even talking about this
Giving this review just makes me so mad about this movie, so
I mean here is some movies they did: Three Hundred, Chainsaw Massacre, Spider-Man Three, they parodied Britney Spears
You know, they just did all this stupid stuff
What can I say I mean that's really about it
I mean seriously just drop these parodying of movies, just a whole bunch of recent movies they parodied and (uhh) you know, who was in it
(stutter) It wasn't Pamela Anderson it was, I don't know what her name even was
(uhh) Carmen Elektra, (stutter) that's who's in it
Just made me so mad, seriously, just stop making these movies, that's all I gotta just to say
I give it like, zero out of five if I could
Like I give it negative
Okay, I give it negative it's terrible, it's all I gotta say
Don't waste your life
Don't see it on DVD when it comes out
Don't, if your kids like, if if (stutter) you're a parent and your kid's like hey, oh well I'm gonna go out with (uhh) my friends we're about to go see (uhh) they're like ten years old it doesn't even matter, but like I'm about to go see it just be like no, you're grounded
Like you are grounded, you go to your room for the rest of the night
Just because they were even thinking about going to see it
Just be like, go to your room, seriously
Hey guys, I'm going to be reviewing The Golden Compass today
I saw it in theaters a few weeks ago
(umm) I read the book
I read it several times, it's one of my favorite books in the whole world and the movie is just terrible
It really doesn't do the book justice at all
(umm) They changed things in the plot around
They added new things
They took away really important facts
They ended it (stutter) early
It was just not good
I mean, not even close to how good the book was
(umm) It did have some things going for it I guess
The acting was pretty good
Nicole Kidman was a, she was a good Misses Colter
She was pretty much how I imagined her, except for the blond hair
Misses Colter was supposed to have black hair but that's okay
(umm) The lead actress was okay I guess
She wasn't exactly how I had pictured Lyra as being but she was okay
She did a decent job
And they did pretty good special effects with the demons and things like that
So, I guess it has those things going for it but, overall I was definitely not impressed (umm) and I really wouldn't recommend it
I'd just read the book instead
Hi
Today I'm reviewing a movie called Fourteen-oh-eight (umm) and this movie's pretty sweet
(umm) I can't go any farther without telling you it's a five out of five stars
It's really sweet
(umm) It's a good movie, it's really weird and twisted but it's a great movie
(umm) And you gotta watch the movie to see that cause a lot of it comes toward the end of the movie
But (umm) yeah basically it's about this this (stutter) guy that he's really into like, you know, got the ghost sightings and stuff so he'll go, he'll stay places where they say they've seen them and just to check if anything's really going on, stuff like that
And he doesn't believe in em cause nothing ever happens to him
He writes books and stuff about it, he's a writer
But (umm) yeah, basically (umm) he hears about this place and he's kind of famous, not really famous, but so so
(umm) People know who he is but his books are always in like bargain bins and stuff like that
But (umm) yeah it's really good, (umm) and (umm) oh yeah
So he (umm) hears about this (uhh) hotel in New York that like anyone that stays there, like they closed it down because people always die when they they're (stutter) in it even for like a few minutes, so (umm) cause it just makes them insane and stuff like that
But (uhh) yeah it's a great movie
I don't want to give away too much but definitely check out Fourteen-oh-eight
(umm) He ends up going and he stays (umm) in it, but I'm not saying how long or any of that
Just gotta watch it, but it's (uhh) Fourteen-oh-eight and I'll show you the little clip
This is more at the beginning, and there's some language and haunting sights so not recommended for kids
{movie} And this is the, (stutter) he has kind of like a meet the author kind of thing going on, and he's just showing up a little bit early, whatnot, getting the deal going
{movie} As you can tell not a whole lot of people know who he is right there
{movie} Okay, well, yeah seriously you got to check this movie out, five out of five stars
Gonna show you the DVD just so you know that I have it
Fourteen-oh-eight
Fourteen-oh-eight
Some big names in it as well
(umm) But yeah
Hi, today I am reviewing a (uhh) a movie called Snakes on a Plane
That's right it's snakes and they're on a plane
How crazy is that? Seriously
(umm) Crazy concept, actually it's kind of dumb
(umm) But yeah
And whenever you watch this you'll realize that the movie's kind of dumb
(umm) I don't know, it was different so I was like sweet
It's gonna be rad
Yeah, it's not that good
Pretty cheesy
(umm) Kind of dumb everything
(uhh) The acting's okay but the snakes are so ridiculously fake
Like I don't know I've seen other people say oh they're so real
I think they're so fake
Like you can even tell it's fake
But (umm) basically I mean that's what the movie's about obviously
There's (umm) passenger plane and (umm) somehow snakes get loaded on and then they just go crazy
So yeah it's it's (stutter) pretty adventurous and (umm) Yeah, so I don't know, It's a little different
I'm gonna give it two out of five
So here's a little scene


504} And this is at the beginning of the movie, (umm) well towards the beginning
Right before they leave


700} There's a lot of language and stuff


Hello and welcome to my review of (uhh) Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street
(uhh) This is an unusual movie
Johnny Depp seems to like to do these weird characters and just weird movies
(uhh) He tends to play the roles well
I will say that Johnny Depp again does a good job in this movie although I did not like this movie
(uhh) It it's (stutter) kind of an unusual movie in the fact that it's a musical
So first off I'm not big into musicals myself, you may be, so you may like it a little better but (uhh) actually my parents love musicals and they hated this movie as well, is what they told me so (uhh)
I don't know, I just I didn't think the movie was, you know, it was well acted, Johnny Depp, you know, he just plays a good weird guy but other than that (uhh) the story, you know, you may be familiar with the story
A guy, you know, tries to get revenge (uhh) and kills a lot of people (uhh) as a barber because he's got a mess of a willing victim sitting there in his chair so (umm)
But it just, the movie didn't do it for me and (uhh) I certainly would not waste my money going to see it in the theater
Hello expotv land
It's me, Danny Ericson, and I'm here to talk to you about the film currently in theaters The Golden Compass, with Nicole Kidman, Dakota Blue Richard, and Daniel Craig, (uhh) the list goes on
But I think, well I haven't read the books, but the movie didn't, was really not that intriguing
It was, it was (stutter) kind of an intriguing (umm) idea kind of thing
(umm) The soul of a person connected to a animal but I feel like the movie did not pull anything off
It really wasn't its own entity, so to speak
It didn't really, it it (stutter) seemed to rely too much on the viewer's background knowledge of the book
(umm) It really wasn't that engaging and it just kept going on and on
It was a long movie
It seemed like more than two hours and (umm) probably it was (stutter) unknown to me it was only the first part of a series of movies so it didn't really have any resolution at all
The acting was actually pretty good
Hi Expo TV Land, it's me Danny Erickson here to talk to you about a movie currently in theaters
(umm) August Rush
This has Freddie Highmore, (stutter) the up and coming young actor, as well as Robin Williams who's consistently disappointing in my opinion
(umm) This movie, (stutter) it was recommended to me by some people who I thought had a good opinion, but I guess they were wrong because this was really a disappointing movie
Even as a family movie it's just way too predictable
I mean, I like the part about, I liked the musical part of the movie
Because he's a music prodigy and he can create music and just has, is in tune with music and (uhh) in a special way
But, the whole premise of the movie is just, just so cheesy, and it's so predictable the whole movie
(umm) twenty minutes in I felt like I knew what was going to happen like every every (stutter) part of the movie
So I just thought it was (Uhh) good performance by Freddie Highmore and a lame performance by Robin Williams
But it was just overall pretty disappointing movie because it got such high appraisal from some people, and I just think that it's just too corny and predictable for most viewers who are looking for a, interesting movie
Oh Hi Expo TV I am here to review the DVD of (uhh) a great comedy from the early nineties Groundhog Day
Starring Bill Murray (uhh) and Andie MacDowell and (uhh) directed by Harold Ramis who started with Bill Murray and stripes (uhh) seven years before (umm) this is one of my favorite comedies of the last say twenty years it's a very simple premise done extremely well, and the simple premise is that a man gets stuck re-living the same day over and over again until he gets it right (uhh) in this case it's a weather man (uhh) played by Bill Murray who gets stuck in Groundhog Day in Puxatony, Philadelphia or excuse me Puxatony, Pennsylvania (uhh) until he gets the day right
(umm) Somehow they found a way to make each new iteration of the day (uhh) different, fresh and it never gets boring in fact (uhh) as you go on you wait more and more to see (uhh) the familiar scenes play out in a different way and that's a lot of that credit goes to the script a lot of that credit goes to Bill Murray (uhh) and Andie Macdowell for keeping things fun
(uhh) Chris Elliott does a really nice supporting job in here as the camera man (umm) I would really recommend getting this DVD (uhh) and if you rent it, or buy it, or whatever you do (uhh) You've got to listen to the Harold Ramis commentary track it's very informative, (uhh) very funny tell's you a lot about the movie (umm) little tidbits like they assumed while they're making the movie that (uhh) Bill Murray is is (stutter) stuck in this day for about ten years
So you get a sense of how long this is going on, even though you see maybe fifteen (uhh) versions of the day throughout the movie he's stuck in it much longer so you get a much greater sense of it
Okay ExpoTv, it's a DVD review it's really bad
It's Dungeons and Dragons on DVD
It's like don't watch it
It's not good at all
I don't know why they made it
It wasn't entertaining, it wasn't even like the funny kind of bad
I guess for the plus side (umm) it's got two audio commentaries and two documentaries and deleted scenes and (uhh) special effects deconstruction
But why would you want to watch any of that when the movie is absolutely horrible
So (umm) {noise} how do they finance this, who said, who who (stutter) was like, Dungeons and Dragons that's a good movie
Marlon Wayans, yeah let's get him in there, he's he's (stutter) great at these serious roles
Who, Dungeons and Dragons shouldn't have been made a, oh man, what's next, like Risk the movie? Okay, so (uhh) time for the rating
Zero out of five
Zero out of ten
Yeah
Dungeons and Dragons, don't watch it unless you're an idiot
(uhh) It's harsh words but it's really not good, I'm I'm (stutter) bummed out I just watched it and wasted my night
Don't watch this movie
Hey expotv land
It's me, Danny Ericson, and I'm here to review the movie Alvin and the Chipmunks (uhh) with Jason Lee
This is (uhh) a newer adaptation with computer animation of the old TV show Alvin and the Chipmunks where there's three chipmunks who sing music and perform, become an overnight sensation and if I had the choice I would not watch this movie ever again because it's really cheesy and even cheesier than I thought it would be and it really didn't even, wasn't fun like the original was, the original TV show
So just really wasn't what I, didn't have the same feel that I hoped that the original TV show had and it's just probably not even that fun of a movie for the family to watch
Kids, younger kids, don't even relate to that TV show
So I would say if you have the choice to go to it, don't go cause it's kind of just a disappointment
But (uhh) so yeah
Well hello expotv land, it's me Danny Ericson and I'm here to talk to you about the new movie in theaters Alien Versus Predator: Requiem
Now this is the sequel to the movie Alien Versus Predator which came out a couple years ago and when I watched that movie I was kind of excited because I'm a fan of the Alien movies and the Predator movies and I was very disappointed by that, so I'm not sure why I watched the second one but I was still surprisingly even more disappointed
(umm) It does include the characters the Aliens from the Alien movies and the Predator from the Predators movies but once again it's just pointless seeming
I didn't really understand why they were fighting each other
It was rated R, (umm) compared to the last one which was rated only PG-thirteen and it had a lot more blood
So if you're into (umm) a lot of gore that's really pointless I guess you'd like this movie but overall I didn't really see a point in watching it because it just didn't seem like there was {laugh} any point to it
Hi
I'm Chris and this is a review of the DVD for the movie The Hulk
(uhh) This movie came out a couple of years ago and I have to say that it wasn't at all what I expected and I was a little bit (uhh) disappointed with this movie
(uhh) I was expecting sort of a (uhh) big screen version of the (uhh) eighties television series (uhh) The Incredible Hulk (uhh) the one that starred (uhh) Lou Ferrigno as the Incredible Hulk
(uhh) I was always a big fan of that growing up and I really liked that show
This movie focuses definitely more on the comic book side of the character the Hulk
(umm) He's definitely (uhh) larger, larger than life type of superhero slash monster
(umm) Whereas in the TV series he was accessible and (stutter) a lot more human than he is in this movie
(umm) As far as stars go, not really a lot of big name stars
Although Nick Nolety is in this movie
I'm not really sure he managed to stumble into this
{clears throat} (uhh) Sam Elliot is in this, (uhh) he's always good and Jennifer Connely is in it as well
The star is (umm) Eric Bana
(umm) He's not really a well-known actor that they got to play the (stutter) lead character here
It's directed by Ang Lee, an excellent director (umm) of (uhh) comic book type movies
(uhh) He's done that before
So I wasn't really thrilled with this
I guess (umm) if you were a big fan of the comic book character of The Hulk you might enjoy this more than I did but (umm) I was actually looking for something else
As far as the DVD goes itself, this is a two disc set
(umm) On the second disc are a bunch of (uhh) deleted scenes and also a level for the Xbox game, (uhh) stuff about the motion capture suit
It's fairly interesting but it's (uhh) nothing spectacular
That's The Hulk on DVD
What's up Expo Ben Mazo here again, today I'm reviewing the movie of Save the Last Dance
Starring Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas
I didn't enjoy this movie at all
So if I was you, I would not buy this or rent this, it's just a waste of money
It's (uhh) it's just pretty much a chick flick about dance and drama
(umm) I am, I'm just not into those type of movies I mean that's just me but, if you like dance and drama movies go for it
I mean, I don't know
And pretty much just about this girl who wants to just be a dancer and everything and she meets a friend and he helps her out and everything but
Not going to ruin the plot for you or anything but I don't I don't even know if I should just ruin the plot because it's not that great of a movie, I don't even want you to see it
But I don't know, I'm giving it one out of five stars for this movie
Not a very good movie, so (uhh) don't pick it up today I guess
(uhh) I mean if you like Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas I guess you could try it, I don't know
I didn't like it but I'll let, everyone has their own opinion so
Save the Last Dance, one out of five stars
Have you ever held someone's dream in your hand? Hey welcome back for another episode of The Bootstrap Boutique where beginners build businesses
I'm glad you're here because today I want to talk about something a little meta, which is making these videos for you every week
And to do that I have to tell you about one of my YouTube mentors, Amy Schmittauer
That's her right there
I found Amy and her YouTube channel SavvySexySocial back when I was looking for how to schedule a post to YouTube, or how to schedule a video to YouTube
Because I was that green and I was that new and I didn't know how to do it
See back in the early days of The Bootstrap Boutique I used to shoot a video, kind of edit it, and immediately upload it and I knew that if I was going to keep doing this week after week then I was going to have to find a better way
So I go to YouTube and I search "how to schedule a video to post on Youtube" and Amy was there with a tutorial
I went and looked up how to do something else and Amy was there with a tutorial
Every question it felt like that I had about how to do something on YouTube, Amy had a tutorial
She was out there providing value and showing her expertise in a way that was truly helpful for what I needed so I became a fan immediately
Her videos were not only informative, they were also entertaining and that led to me binge watching them
She's got 700 and some, I haven't seen them all I'm sure, but I've watched a lot of them because I was learning something with each new video
One thing that I really picked up on, and I didn't know it was a "thing" was the way she structured her videos
Her short intro, immediately giving you all the information you need, a call to action and end it
So there's not all this extra fluff in her videos
Oh, and look, there it is right there on page 87, it's Amy's Authority Video Formula all about how to do a YouTube video
And I have borrowed from it

It's why you'll notice now in my videos I try to really just jump into the content, cut to the chase and not give a whole bunch of fluff and talk about whatever I was talking about in those early videos that probably had nothing to do with Amazon or selling on Amazon
It's also why I end with a much more clear call to action
Do you remember when I used to spell our my Twitter handle at the end, who's got time for that? Nobody
But if I say "hey, leave me a comment" you can do that

It's not, "leave me a comment, like this video, check out the checklist, here's my twitter handle, let me spell my email address for you" I don't know what I was thinking
So thank you Amy, because I needed that
Amy's videos are all about giving value and that is absolutely something that I try to emulate in my videos for you guys
So hey, here's my crystal clear call to action
I have a link to Amy's book in the description below
Go click that link and buy her book
Because I'll tell you, I actually am a member of Amy's book squad and I got an advanced digital copy to read for a review, and I loved the book so much and I got so much out of it that I went and I bought this book myself even though I already have it in pdf
One, I like paper, but also I wanted to support Amy because she's given me so much through her channel and it's an awesome resource
It's something that is going to be dogearred, underlined, and sticky noted all over
So here's that call to action again
Check the link below, buy the book
Hello Expo TV, how you guys doing today? I am here (uhh) to review the new blockbuster movie Vantage Point
(uhh) I think this movie got number one over (uhh) the weekend
Probably because there much else there
Because this movie I I (stutter) wouldn't recommend at all
(umm) It does have some good actors in it though, Forrest Whitaker, Dennis Quaid (umm) etcetera etcetera
There's tons of it, but (uhh) it it it (stutter) doesn't really go anywhere
(umm) It just keeps, you get tired of it kind of keep repeating itself to see these different vantage points
I thought it'd do that even a little bit different and better but, it didn't even do that
(umm) I can't recommend at all going to this movie
(umm) I I'd (stutter) say wait for TV
(uhh) This just just was a bad movie
(umm) Maybe a couple good spots, but not worth the (uhh) ticket price
(umm) That is Vantage Point
I am reviewing Stephen King's The Mist and it's now currently playing in theaters
This movie was, it was okay
I mean I like Stephen King stories (umm) but this movie wasn't scary
Usually scary movies are filled with psychological terror and stuff, but this one was just shows you a bunch of monsters
It (uhh) the story line is basically (uhh) a mist attacks, like, an island, a small island and a bunch of people crowd into a grocery store to try and avoid the mist and, and (stutter) I won't spoil the end but the ending was (umm) {noise} kind of touching I guess, but the ending was okay
(uhh) Nicely planned, (umm) just the fact that they ended up showing all the monsters that were in the mist (umm) just made it (uhh) it it (stutter) just wasn't scary anymore
I don't know if you can call it a horror since the monsters weren't really scary
They were just basically like giant bugs and giant lobsters
Hello
Today I would like to review for you a movie currently in theaters called Mad Money
It stars Ted Danson, Queen Latifah, and (uhh) Diane Keaton
(umm) It's basically, it's a light comedy
It's sort of like an adult contemporary comedy
(umm) It's about (uhh) these three women that that (stutter) work for the national reserve and (umm) they're just like, you know, normal women, they're not like (uhh) thieves or gangsters or anything like that
They're just, you know, your normal everyday women
And they're plotting to steal (uhh) this money that's going to be destroyed by the national reserve cause (stutter) of course the national reserve controls the money and, you know, sometimes money just has to be destroyed
So (umm) they plot to steal this money for themselves and, you know, comedy ensues
So it's, like I said it's a light comedy so it was, when the movie was over I was somewhat pleased and entertained but it was sort of one of those take it or leave it kind of things
(umm) It's a very forgettable film and like the casting isn't that great
Like Ted Danson is in it so, I mean, if that says anything then I know you know what I'm talking about, but yeah
(uhh) Mad Money, (uhh), it's okay
If you're in the mood for a light comedy, if there's nothing else playing at the theater
{cough} Hi, I'm Mike with expotv and this is my movie review of The Hottie and the Nottie
And this is (uhh) easily one of the worst films ever created
(uhh) For those of you not familiar with it, it is (uhh) features Paris Hilton and I believe she received top billing, so she is the star of the movie
(umm) She plays a girl who (umm) years ago, when she was about six or seven years old, had a mutual crush on a little boy about the same age
(umm) And we now grow up (uhh) twenty, twenty-five years later, and (uhh) we pick up the story where that boy goes back to find her and realizes that she is beautiful or perfect in his eyes but, and she would be considered the hottie, but there is a nottie who is not hot, for those of you not up on these terms
And it is a girl wearing obviously bad makeup, (uhh) bad hair, bad fat suit, all this kind of stuff and the minute you see her you can tell that somewhere underneath there a makeover is going to occur
So (uhh) it's just coming down the turnpike
(uhh) This movie should be avoided like the plague, it's completely awful
(umm) All the (uhh) the writers (uhh) should be indicted (umm) and all the actors (uhh), you know, (stutter) tortured to some extent
So definitely avoid this film at all costs
Hello, expo
I'd like to tell you about a movie called The Hottie and the Nottie
This is a movie starring Paris Hilton
The only thing that really saves this movie is that Paris has her clothes on
It's really a terrible, terrible movie and it shows that, once again, Paris has to be in front of the camera
She's very narcissistic in doing that because, after all the trouble she's been in and after all the terrible (uhh) X-rated that movies she's been in, I'm real, not even, I don't even understand why she would want to be in a movie
Why I went to see this? Actually it was a matinee, so I paid around five dollars to see it
Actually, it wasn't worth a dollar to see
I suppose I was just curious to see if she could redeem herself
She's not an actress
She
The story plot's lame
It's a silly really it (uhh)
She's supposed to be the gorgeous girl that a school mate has had a (stutter) long-time crush on
Her girlfriend is supposed to be (uhh) uglier than ugly and can't find a date
(uhh) Paris decides that she will not date anyone until she can find a date for her girlfriend, so she goes to all means to make her girlfriend (uhh) accessible and that's basically is the plot of the story
We do see a lot of Paris, but thank goodness she has her clothes on
That's really the only good thing I can say about it
Hi expotv land
It's me, Danny Ericson, and I'm here to talk to you about this great new movie called The Hottie and the Nottie, starring Paris Hilton and (uhh) Joel Moore
(umm) This is just a great movie
(umm) Just had great themes in it
I (umm) it's about this guy called Nate who is (umm) Who is (uhh) who has liked this girl since he was a little boy and he's had a lot of other girlfriends but he's finally realized that Paris Hilton is the one for him
So he tracks her down but realizes that there's this girl that's really ugly that (umm) (stutter) that Paris Hilton's always hanging out with and that she won't go on a date without her friend who's ugly but then he (stutter) then so he's trying to find all these guys to go on dates with her
But (uhh) it turns out it's one of the best movies of the year and I would say definitely go and watch it if you're planning on having the worst time of your life
Paris Hilton in a movie? Please, come on
This is not a good movie
I don't think you should watch it
One out of ten, if that
Hi I'm Jesse and (uhh) today I'm going to talk to you for just a brief moment about Stanley Kubrick's two thousand one A space Odyssey
And I took the word brief very poignantly because this movie is anything but
It's (uhh) about, yeah it says here, four thousand minutes long which it translates to over forty hours somehow and (umm)
Sure it's a classic and there's a lot of symbolism that you see all over in in (stutter) our culture, (uhh) especially The Simpson's
But (uhh) And and (stutter) of course that whole I'm afraid I can't do that Dave is from this
And so, you kind of have to see this at some point on your life just so you know what it's about
But (uhh) if you're looking to have like a nice relaxing time or if you really enjoy science fiction, (umm) spend your money elsewhere
This movie is immensely boring
There's one part where they (uhh) go to Mars or something and they show the entire trip to Mars like unabridged
It's it's (stutter) like four days where they're just in stasis and the camera moves around occasionally
It's like a surveillance camera on a spaceship
It's (uhh) incredibly boring
But there's (stutter) I guess there's some neat ideas or something cause I (uhh) {laugh} I couldn't, I was asleep for most of it but people just, that's what I'm reading on the internet
Ten thousand B

(umm) I'm not sure what I miss more, the five dollars I spent to go see it or the two hours I spent watching it
(umm) This movie was absolutely abysmal, is the only word I can think of to describe it
(umm) Just the first line of the movie was just, it was just ridiculous
It was (umm) (uhh) The only err only time will tell the difference between legend and truth, and you're just like, what the heck does that even mean? Does that Mean that this whole movie is just a lie? Anyways, (umm) this movie follows the story of (umm) this one guy who's like the chosen ,you know, guy, to like overthrow these Egyptians
I don't, it's really unclear, as they go from like Himalayas to like, a rain forest to a desert in like three days, just walking
And it's just it's, it's (stutter) really ridiculous and then there's there's (stutter)
Okay there's this one part where like, where he's in like, this pit, and there's like a saber-toothed tiger in there and he was just like, I'm gonna kill you
Aww but wait, you're sort of trapped in these sticks, I'm not gonna kill you so don't kill me
And the saber-toothed tiger is like, alright that's cool
I don't know
Anyways, the xxx in it like, weren't even that cool and I mean there were like, mammoths, CGI mammoths that were sorta neat I guess
It wasn't visually that stunning
(umm) The girl wasn't even like that attractive
It was just an overall disappointment but, I mean it was funny to see just cause we could make fun of it afterwards
Right now I'm going to be reviewing The Descent
The (uhh) movie came out last summer and I watched it recently and I feel that it was kind of a lackluster effort by the (uhh) people who made this movie
Basically it's about a group of women who annually go on an adventure
This year they decide to go exploring some (uhh) underground caves and (uhh) they get lost due to a cave in and proceed to be attacked by some weird kind of creatures
The movie is really fast paced, kind of lacks a plot
There's a little twist at the end, which I didn't really care for and had a little trouble understanding and seemed a little disjointed there at the very end
Hi, I'm Mike with expotv and this is my movie review of College Road Trip, which was a complete utter waste of time
(umm) Ever since the American Pie movies came out around ten years ago (uhh) people have been coming up with movies like Road Trip and College Road Trip, all this type of (uhh) different stuff
Well this one basically stars (uhh) Martin Lawrence and he's reconnecting with his daughter who's getting ready to go to college
(uhh) And because Martin Lawrence is in it (uhh) it's kind of funny because he's he's (stutter) a seasoned, funny, professional guy (uhh) but the movie is just watered down
It's got that (uhh) really awful RV meets Are We There Yet type of vibe to it where it's so family oriented, it has such, such (stutter) moments every five or ten minutes of just unfunny stupidity that it's just a real challenge to enjoy
(umm) I would say I can't really think of anybody that might (uhh) enjoy the movie
(uhh) If if (stutter) you were sleeping or comatose in the film you might enjoy it
(uhh) If you were in the bathroom during the whole film (stutter), you know, you might like it too but if you're forced to watch it then you're pretty much not gonna enjoy it at all
(umm) I definitely think Martin Lawrence needs to go back to some other funny things
(uhh) It's kind of sad but, you know, you probably thought a year or two ago when you saw (uhh), if you did see, Wild Hogs you'd probably think "well wow, he can't get any lower" but he actually did
(uhh) So maybe he needs to go back and do Wild Hogs Two or just do something to get his career back on track, but but (stutter) this is just a big mess
Hi
My name is Mike, and this is my ExpoTV movie review of the film Over Her Dead Body, which is a movie that I guess (umm) I I (stutter) don't know, words really can't describe
It wasn't very good
It might make a good date movie
(uhh) But basically, the plot (umm) is just kind of, it seemed sort of TV movie-ish, like (uhh) like something that even Lifetime might even reject
But basically in it, you have (umm) Eva Longoria Parker, from Desperate Housewives, and she plays a bride that accidentally gets killed on her wedding day and (uhh) her fiance slash husband from that wedding day is Paul Rudd
And (uhh) he (umm) basically takes it pretty hard, as most of us would
(umm) And then (uhh) what happens from there is he decides to go consult a psychic and go sort of deal with the with the (stutter) whole situation in therapy
And, as you might expect, the psychic is an attractive female, because it is movieland, and he starts to fall in love with her
(umm) And then (uhh) from the grave, Eva Longoria Parker decides to (uhh) torture him and, and (stutter) try and break them up and everything
And it it involves a lot of scenes where she (umm) is sort of, like, hovering over them or watching him and her as the new romance develops and stuff
So (umm) it all wraps up (uhh) toward the end as you might expect
I won't give anything away
But (umm) just overall, it's just a painful exercise to watch, not a really good movie, something that you should steer clear of (umm) even if (uhh) I'm not a fan of Desperate Housewives, but even even (stutter) (uhh) the the (stutter) person that I went with (uhh) she is, and she even hated the movie
So just overall just steer clear of this movie
(umm) If you have to entertain yourself this weekend, (uhh) buy a puzzle, maybe dogs playing poker, put it together or something, you know
What's up Expo Tv
I have a movie review called College Road Trip
Came out March two thousand eight
(uhh) Went to see this with my younger sister
It was absolutely terrible
It was directed by Roger Cumble and it's (uhh) about how (stutter) this high student which is (stutter) Raven from (stutter) That's So Raven (uhh) goes around the country to choose a college that she wants but her dad who's a cop but played by Martin Lawrence, (uhh) goes along with her to try and find the perfect college for her
And (uhh) it's just a really terrible movie to and, terrible attempt at a comedy
It's definitely directed towards like a younger generation cuz of like Raven was in it
(uhh) But it was absolutely terrible
I do not recommend checking this out
If I could give it a zero I would but I know there's no option for zero so I'm going to have to give College Road Trip a one out of five and recommend that everyone stays away from this movie
I don't know why they released this in theaters, it doesn't deserve to be in theaters
What's up Expo, I have a movie review for you, it's Step Up two the Streets
Came out February two thousand eight
It was directed by Jon by Jon Chu
Basically it's like the romance, but with like dancing involved
(uhh) It doesn't have like the like like (stutter) (uhh) Channing Tatum's not in it which pretty much made Step Up I cause like (uhh) because like the storyline was decent
But this one it's just like, not that good
People in it are like Robert Hoffman and other like people that I've never even heard of before
(uhh) I wasn't too impressed with the movie
(uhh) It really really wasn't that good
It's It's (stutter) just like (uhh) like they go to the same school and like dancing brings them together
(uhh) But this sequel, not good
It's not a good sequel at all
I do not recommend seeing this movie
Hello
(uhh) For my review today I'll do Semi-Pro, the Will Ferrell new comedy out in theaters
I caught this about two days ago in the evening, I went to my local theater with my friend and both of him and myself were big fans of, like, Old School and even Ricky Bobby and Blades of Glory were okay
But I'll have to admit for this review that Semi-Pro xxx on the same kind of comedy and jokes all the rest of them worked on, but it's almost getting a little stale
I hate to say it cause I love Will Ferrell but the jokes are all kind of the same you've seen before
He's attacked by an animal in one scene, the downtrodden like, you know, ABA team you've got to win games to rally the crowd and the team and I don't know
You you (stutter) want to like Will Ferrell but my reviews have to be mixed but negative
I don't want to say skip it or, you know why not get it as a rental later on? It may not be worth the full ten dollars or nine dollars they charge for a movie nowadays
As the price gets up there I have to be more and more picky about what I go to and this one I probably wouldn't go to again
There are some funny moments but they're far and few between
So Will Ferrell Semi-Pro I might recommend you just see this at home instead of in the theater
My name is Eric Nederland
And I am reviewing the movie Twenty-Seven Dresses for Expo Tv dot com
Yes
I did see this movie
Not by my own choice, I was forced to
It was everything you might expect from such a movie
Romantic comedy, about a woman who has been a bridesmaid twenty-seven times
Now, I don't know about you, but I don't think I'm going to be a wedding attendant twenty-seven times and I don't know how many people really will be
That in itself was a little bit unbelievable
But unfortunately that was one of the more believable plot points
Now, I don't have anything against the actors, the director, I just don't think it was a movie that was worth being made
Everything was romantic comedy-ish
It was cliched
Unbelievable leaps of the imagination you have to suspend your disbelief like, I don't know
Like an elephant was stepping on your pants
If you like that sort of thing, go see it
Hey Expo tv this is my video review of the movie ten thousand B

(umm) If you know anything about the director you know he directed Independence Day, and he also I believe directed The Patriot
Both those movies were excellent and I think ninety-nine percent of the population will agree with you on that
However, if you're like me and you use that to say, hey, let's go see ten thousand B

it's by that guy who directed Independence Day
You're going to be highly disappointed
This movie is horrible
It's about these like people just running around doing pointless stuff that you don't care about
{cough} I would almost describe it as like a reality tv show from ten thousand B

like I don't care about this guy running around in the jungle
I just want this to end
{cough} There's really like, I didn't (stutter) catch too much of a plot like there's like (umm) there's this little plot that's stupid
The movie has no substance
It's not interesting, it's not gonna hold your attention
And it is really long, like I don't know I don't know (stutter) the exact minutes or anything but I would say it's got to be close to two hours long and that is
For a movie that sucks this bad, two hours is way too much, so
{cough} I don't know I mean, you can rent this movie and just fast forward it through the boring parts but, I think you would miss about an hour and a half of the movie if you did that
And I'm not going to necessarily say that's a bad thing
So this is ten thousand B
Hi I'm Tom and today I'm gonna be reviewing Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns
As a formality here's the movie ticket
Here and here's the movie ticket sideways, that's not a formality that's just for fun
Alright, now if you've seen any of the other Tyler Perry movies this is exactly like it, so if you like those, you'll like this
It's too much for me at this point if I see another Tyler Perry movie I'm never gonna go see it
The only one saving grace for this movie was Medea
Medea's always hilarious
I I (stutter) don't know why but Tyler Perry dressed up as a large, tall woman makes me laugh
Don't know about you, but it does me
Now this movie is yeah, as I said, exactly the same as the other ones, it's like a love family type story
(uhh) Way too many stereotypes, I I wanna (stutter) I wouldn't recommend this movie
Not one bit
I would just wait for it to come out on a network television when it gets replayed three times for a weekend and then every other weekend for the rest of its life
So no, please don't go see this movie it's horrible
Unless you like the others then go see this, otherwise wait
Hello, ExpoTV users
I am here to review a movie that is currently in theaters called Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns
This movie, it has a good heart
It's about family and love and drama and has some (stutter) comedy
It's basically the story about a single mother raising her children, and she really wants to keep her kids off the street, obviously
But she gets fired from her job and begins to get hopeless
And then she finds out that a father, her father that she never even knew existed, had died
So she decides to take her family from Chicago down to Georgia for the funeral
And she meets a whole family she never knew existed
Basically, it has some touching scenes
It has, does have some funny scenes
But all in all, it seems like he's trying too hard
If you're a Tyler Perry fan, you may enjoy this movie, although I don't even like this one as much as his others and I didn't even like the others too much
It's based on a play of the same name, and, I don't know, I wouldn't really waste my money unless you're a big fan of his
Hey Expo TV
Today I'm here to talk about the movie Blind Mountain
(uhh) This movie's about something you rarely rarely hear about
(umm) This is about (umm) the slave trafficking, in (uhh) in particular Asia
(umm) This movie's about (umm) young individual who is captured and sold as a sexual slave
(umm) This is something that goes on with reasonable frequency (umm) especially in Eastern Asia
(umm) This boy is taken to a remote village in China and he kinda really sees no support from anywhere
He's kind of trapped in this horrible, horrible cycle (umm) with with (stutter) no way out it seems
(umm) And the movie's really kind of just about white slavery or Asian slavery
(umm) Instead of, you normally hear about (uhh) American slavery of the African Americans
(umm) But this movie kind of takes another direction and kind of opens your eyes to different issues in the world
(umm) As a movie overall, I thought the acting was poor
(umm) The story could have been filmed a lot better I think, because it's very interesting
I just think it's hard to make that work into a cohesive (umm) watchable (umm) story
(umm) So the story was definitely very poor how they did it
(umm) If it was purely (umm) (stutters) If it was purely historical, I think it would work
(uhh) Maybe to be shown in schools, something like that
But as a movie, (umm) it definitely falls short
So I'm gonna say one out of five stars, as a movie
Hi I'm Tom and today I'm gonna be reviewing the movie ten thousand BC
As validation here is my movie ticket which kinda got crumpled in my pocket I apologize
There we go, yeah, front pocket
(umm) Okay this movie bothered me a lot just because it was really not historically accurate
But I don't know if they were trying to set out for that but that's the part that just confuses me
(uhh) Special effects were great but the cast that, you knew nobody
(umm) It it's (stutter) a good movie
It it (stutter) follows the story of this (stutter) mammoth hunter and it, trying to do better for his tribe, or trying to get his tribe a better life
(umm) It's got a lot of really good action
They were trying to push this as a like, the next big epic movie just like three hundred but no it didn't come anywhere close and the best part is, if you (uhh) look back to the release dates, three hundred was released the same weekend just a year prior to it
(umm) So I think that's what they were really trying to push for was like the same audience, the same, oh this is going to be huge and epic
It wasn't that good
(uhh) Three hundred was completely epic, this if if (stutter) you want a comparison just three hundred here, ten thousand BC here
(umm) I would rent this one or maybe ask for it for like a holiday present just so I don't have to spend money on it
But the special effects are great, historically accurate no
I'm going to give this a two out of five
Hi I'm Tom and today I'm gonna be reviewing the movie Superhero Movie
Before I begin this is what I need to do
{slaps palm on forehead} Ok, I'll explain why in a minute, but as always I hold on to it, here's the movie ticket
I'm ashamed I have this
Alright, I don't know why I went to see this
I really shouldn't have
I should've learned my lesson from four Scary Movies, Epic Movie, Date Movie
I should've learned my lesson
No, I like slapstick though
So I figured, okay this could be good, it's got Leslie Nielson in it again and he always amuses me every single time
And yes he was funny in this one
Airplane's amazing, (umm) yeah that's why I just like him so much
Okay this kind of has Drake Bell in his first starring role, the Nickelodeon icon or whatever
Hannah Montana, Nickelodeon, okay maybe not
(umm) He (uhh) gets into a freak accident and turns into the new clumsy superhero know as Dragonfly
Okay, that's about it for the plot
Yes, it is in depth as a paper bag
(umm) Look I got an apple
(umm) Okay the slapstick in it is funny
As always, it's not worth spending as much as I did to go see this
I just had a few friends who wanted to see this, I'm like alright fine, I'll go
If you get into that situation, don't do it
Learn from my mistake
As (stutter) as I had to slap myself over the head, I should have learned from the first eight mistakes
somewhere in there
(umm) It's, as I said it's slapstick funny
Makes fun of all superhero movies, at least for the most part
(umm) What more can you really say about a really dumb movie
(umm) Stick with Airplane, Leslie Nielson, you did that one great
You're funnier than the rest of em
Please don't tag on to horrible movies cause then I'll go see them
I wasted so much on this
Don't go see this
(umm) Wait for it to become a budget renter
Not even a budget theater
Not even a regular rental, wait for the rental to be there so long it's now cheaper
Go for those
Just wait for that long if you actually want to see this movie
That's my advice
(uhh) One out of five
Kelly and Ryan which I'm super excited about it's Gonna be with Colleen um
I just need to get an outfit so we're going to go shop around you can get it up serve a look serve a look shall I
What's up Expo
I've got a Denzel Washington movie right here, Out of Time
Didn't like this movie
I'm a huge Denzel fan
I love every Denzel movie I think he's an amazing actor
And he, he (stutter) is a good actor in this movie
(umm) Like he plays his character well
It's not that, I just don't like the movie
The movie's terrible
He plays his character good
He still is an amazing actor
(umm) But this movie was not very good
(umm) It's got Eva Mendes in it though, which is, she's beautiful you know that
And Sanaa Lathan from Blade, and Dean Cain from Lois and Clark and Ripley's Believe It Or Not
So if you're into any of those, those (stutter) people I mean check it out
I didn't like it but that doesn't mean you won't
(umm) It's a cop story
Denzel's the, the good guy
Look at him on the cover
He's the good guy but
I just, I wasn't feeling Out of Time
Expotv, let's talk about Nim's Island
Alright, now, it's a kid's movie okay? But now overall though kid's movies usually are pretty good overall, like as movies
This movie was not
Let me tell you why, alright? Now, well the acting was good, especially Abigail Breslin
That was the only good thing about the movie
Now other times it's just like the story line wasn't that good for a kid's movie, you know? Normally you can go see a kid's movie no matter what age you are and love it
Like, I mean, all Disney stuff, everything
Pixar, whatever
This one just it just didn't have that many elements
I mean there definitely was not like any like adult humor, you know, that only adults get and stuff
(stutter) I don't even know if kids would like it
It's just, I mean it's a really fantasy movie, there's a lot of like weird stuff
I mean that's cool but Jodie Foster doesn't do a great job, you know, so the only good thing about the acting is Abigail Breslin
And like some of the camera work is just like oh this is horrible
I mean on a on a (stutter) scale of like stars I would give it definitely like two stars out of five
I mean if you have to see it go see it because your little kid might want to see it or something, or your little brother or sister
But overall it's just really not worth seeing
I mean you could definitely take them to see something else
If they're enthusiastic about seeing it take them because, I mean, maybe they might like it but you will have to sit through something that's really you're just like "I do not want to be here"
So I mean if you if you (stutter) have to, go see it
Hi guys
(uhh) Today I am going to talk about a new released movie, Superhero movie
(umm) This is a spoof movie of Spider Man but you can also say something, something (stutter) into account like X-man and (umm) some other movies
(uhh) This spoof movie is like (uhh) not that much interesting because (uhh) I don't like spoof movie that much but (uhh) I like the movies (uhh) Meet the Spartans but this movie doesn't (uhh) I I (stutter) don't like this movie much
Hey, ExpoTV
This is Aubs eighty four
Today, I'm going to talk about the movie, Nim's Island
And this stars Jodie Foster and Gerard Butler
(umm) Many of you will recognize Gerard Butler from movies such as three hundred, where he played the main character in that film
He plays a little more of a bit part in this film, so if you're going to go rush out to see the movie for Gerard Butler, you're going to be disappointed
He plays the role of a a (stutter) father
Nim is the main character of the movie
She is a little girl who lives on this island with her father, Gerard Butler
(umm) They're kind of secluded from everybody
(umm) The father is a scientist who does a lot of research and needs a lot of time for his experiments, so he doesn't have a lot of time for his daughter, Nim
And to counter this, Nim has a lot of fanciful creatures that she's created
She has a very active imagination in this one
She loves to read books
That's her favorite hobby
And her favorite author is played by Jodie Foster
And what happens is, Nim's father goes out to sea to do a experiment
A storm comes out
He gets lost out at sea
Nim writes her favorite author for some help, saying that her father's lost, what does she do, how does she get through life, I mean, what's her next step And Jodie Foster's character comes out to the island to hang out with Nim and try to help her cope and do things like that
Now, this is not a very realistic story at all
(umm) First of all, who lives on a deserted island, a deserted volcanic island, with (uhh) just a father and a daughter? Nobody does that
And especially when the father sails away to do science experiments and leaves Nim all by herself
I mean, she can't be more than, I don't know, twelve or thirteen
And for her to be alone on this island is ridiculous without a father or a babysitter, anything
So that's the first (uhh) ridiculous part of the movie
The next ridiculous part is that a letter written by a little girl to a famous author would actually solicit a visit
I mean, maybe the author would write back and say, you know, thanks for the letter, blah, blah, blah
But, no, the author actually comes out to the island to be with this little girl
(uhh) That's also ridiculous
(umm) So it's not very believable
It's very fanciful (umm), lots of crazy stuff going on in the way of imagination
(uhh) It's definitely a little kid's movie
And if you have a daughter or a son who is probably under the age of ten, I think they'd love it because there's some imaginary creatures
There's a little bit of action
It can be a little scary
I would say the storm scene might be a little frightening for some younger kids
(umm) But it's just kind of a fun movie for the younger generation
And definitely if you're an adult, don't go in prepared to believe everything
I guess when I went to the film, I didn't know what to expect
I didn't know that this was supposed to be, you know, a joke and supposed to be all creative and imaginative
So I was expecting a lot, and I was disappointed
I'm only going to give it a one out of five stars because there's not a lot of redeeming quality to it
(umm) One of the best scenes is just kind of a touchy moment (umm) where, you know, a father and daughter have to say goodbye to one another
And, you know, if that's the best scene in the movie, I think that says a lot
Hey, ExpoTV
This is Aub eighty four
Today I'm going to talk about the movie College Road Trip, starring Martin Lawrence and Raven Symone
(umm) Before I go into character detail, I'll give you a little heads up about what the movie is about
Martin Lawrence plays a police officer who decides to go on a road trip with his daughter, playing by Raven Symone, to check out colleges
And he's very worried about the kind of trouble that she's going to get into when she's away at college (umm) you know, drugs, sex, parties, things like that
So basically the movie revolves around how he tries to keep her away from these kinds of things while they're on the road trip, and he definitely is trying to pick out a college that is clean and well-run and not going to lead her astray
(umm) Many of you will recognize Raven Symone
She was a child actor on a lot of TV shows
(uhh) She has a couple of movies out
And I was actually surprised to see how much she's grown up
(umm) Obviously, she's of college age for this movie, and I think she does a much better job of acting now than she did when she was a kid, (uhh) maybe understandable, a little more training, a little more experience could do a lot
(uhh) Martin Lawrence is in his typical role, kind of a wise-cracking humor (umm) lots of situational gags, some physical comedy
(umm) I would say that if you've seen a Martin Lawrence comedy, you've seen this movie
It's very similar
(uhh) One of the best parts of the movie is a scene where (umm) Martin Lawrence's character finds these coffee beans and he thinks they're drugs
And so he feeds them to this pig and the pig goes crazy on caffeine
So that was kind of a situational, physical, ha, ha, ha bit
And that was one of the funnier scenes of the movie, unfortunately
I guess there's just not much that hasn't been done for kind of the college road trip type deal
For instance, there's a movie called Road Trip, a movie called Eurotrip
And while those were all teenagers and, and (stutter) more a little about drugs and getting drunk and sex, it's still the kind of same humor, where people drive around and they say funny things and there's a parent you try to avoid because they will get you in trouble
And that just felt like the same thing for this movie
Definitely not one of my favorites
There wasn't anything new in terms of comedy
No real humor that really got me rolling or anything like that
No special effects
Soundtrack is debatable
(umm) There was one good song, many okay songs, and a couple songs I just wondered why they were even on the soundtrack, what a waste of my life
(umm) I'm only going to give this movie a two out of five stars for all of those reasons
If you do have to see it, I would say rent it
Don't rush out to see it in the theaters
Hello, everyone
Playing over my shoulder is this
This is Freejack
This is a terrible movie
(umm) I first heard of this movie (uhh) when a friend of mine in grade school decided to (uhh) rip off its storyline for a (uhh) short story that he had written (uhh) in grade school
He (uhh) lifted (uhh) large elements of the plot
And (uhh) as he was explaining this in front of the class, I thought to myself, huh, that sounds an awful lot like Freejack
And (uhh) (uhh) this movie storyline and his storyline are as follows: (uhh) Emilio Estevez plays a race car driver who (umm) just as he is about to die in a (uhh) horrible race car driving accident, he, his (stutter) body is snatched into the future, (uhh) thanks to (uhh) a billionaire Anthony Hopkins
And (umm) the reason Anthony Hopkins' character does that is so he can take his (uhh) mind and implant it into the body of Emilio Estevez's character, thus giving him eternal life or some nonsense
(umm) Also in this movie is Rene Russo, who was in Lethal Weapons three and four, and the Thomas Crown Affair
And (uhh) also in this movie, in addition to her, is (umm) Mick Jagger here, who was in The Rolling Stones and still is in The Rolling Stones
And his performance is terrible in this movie
(umm) He has one facial expression, and it pretty much consists of this
(uhh) Anthony Hopkins is in this movie very, very barely
(umm) I think for like the first half of the movie, at the very least, he's not even in the same room with any of the other main characters
He communicates with Rene Russo's character (uhh) via a (uhh) telecommunications device
And he's (uhh) either in, like, China or (uhh) France or something
And the backdrop is just some mad painting and it looks terrible
And (umm) he really, really, sincerely, honestly phoned in his performance
I honestly think that in, in (stutter) like the final third of the movie, or whatever, in the latter half of the movie, I actually think it's more like the final third or the final quarter, when he actually is in the same room with Emilio Estevez and Rene Russo
I, I (stutter) honestly think that they just used a body double for him so that he did not have to be in the same room with anyone else
And I think they just shot his coverage separately
It just has that feel to it
(umm) Yeah, this is a, a really stupid movie, and me and my friends used to get together and (umm) watch really awful movies like this and just talk over them and make fun of them
And (uhh) this is by far my favorite one
I think this was the last one that (uhh) that me and my friends in (uhh) Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, watched before I moved to Chicago
And (uhh) I have fond memories of watching this tremendous piece of crap with (uhh) my friends before moving
ExpoTV, let's talk about Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns
All right? First of all, Tyler Perry, quit making stuff
Quit making TV shows
You're not funny
No one thinks you're funny
It's stupid
Let me tell you why
All right? Now, the premise of the movie, Meet the Browns, is extremely stupid
I highly recommend going to see anything except for this movie
All right? The acting was not that good
The writing even wasn't that good
All right? All right, now, all right, the acting was okay, but the writing wasn't good, and there's nothing new about the screen shots, the cinematography
All right? There's, like, no reason to see it
There is not one reason to see this movie
In my opinion, I think you could spend your money and, more importantly, your time elsewhere or in a different (stutter) movie in the theater, or don't even go to movies
Go do something else, because this movie is not good
All right? Seriously, whoever cast this movie, not good
And Tyler Perry, this is a message from me to you
Do not make movies, because they're not good
Everyone on ExpoTV, please do not see this movie
It's not worth your time
Hello everyone
Playing over my shoulder is this movie
This is Munich which was directed by Steven Spielberg
(uhh) It stars Eric Bana as a (uhh) the the (stutter) leader of a group of (uhh) Israelis who are given the task of killing the eleven Palestinians who (uhh) were responsible for the nineteen-seventy-two (uhh) Munich massacre of (uhh) eleven Israeli athletes
It was based on the (uhh) book Vengeance by George Jonas and (uhh) I really didn't like this movie that much
It (uhh) really didn't (uhh) involve me at any kind of, you know, serious emotional level
(umm) It's supposed to be about the (uhh) the toll that murder takes on, you know, normal people and (uhh) again, I I (stutter) like I just it didn't really surprise me that these people were experiencing regret that they were killing, you know, people even though those people themselves (uhh) may have deserved it
(umm) That that (stutter) revelation really didn't blow me away that they were feeling that way and (umm) and I I (stutter) have a personal rule that if (uhh), you know, you don't really know the names of characters you can't really get that involved with them, and in all honesty the only two people whose names I remember from this movie are Avner who was (uhh) Eric Bana's character and Carl who was played (uhh) (umm) by (uhh) Ciaran Hinds (uhh) in this movie and (umm) I really didn't (uhh) I I (stutter) like I I (stutter) really didn't have any kind of emotional attachment to any of the characters in this movie
(umm) I I (stutter) was really unaffected by it
(uhh) Geoffrey Rush is in it and (uhh) he was alright and (umm) Daniel Craig who was James Bond is also in the movie but (uhh) there there (stutter) were some genuine moments of like tension and excitement and (uhh) but in all honesty it really didn't add up to much for me
It it (stutter) just, the movie just went on and on
It was about two hours and forty minutes long and it just (uhh) I just became less and less invested in it as time progressed and (umm) it was, it was (stutter) just an okay movie
So I I (stutter) really, I I (stutter) don't really recommend it
There are better movies by Spielberg
Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, any of the Indiana Jones movies although that's like comparing apples and oranges
But yeah, this was just (uhh)
Hey, expo tv, this is Aubs eighty four and tonight I'm going to give a review of the movie A Four Letter Word, which is currently in theaters
(uhh) This is a more independent film, so many of you won't be able to find it at your major theaters
If you have an independent or unaffiliated theater near you, this is where you're going to find this movie
It it's (stutter) a gay movie
It follows the story of a two gay gentlemen who end up (uhh) hooking up and trying to make a relationship work
It starts out where one of the guys is kinda macho man
He's (uhh) he's (stutter) all about the guys
He sleeps around a lot
He's never been tied down
He's afraid of commitment
He's just out to have a good time
And he's got a lot of (uhh), you know, friends with him who kinda do much of the same
However, one time he goes into a bar and he meets this guy, and his name is Stephen, who is exact opposite
He's, you know, all about lovey-dovey, commitment, relationship and the two end up falling in love together
(umm) The story is mostly about how they try to deal with being in a monogamous relationship (uhh) when the one guy kinda isn't very used to that
It deals with a lot of homosexual issues (umm) in terms of acceptance and they try to deal with love in their own way and how the mainstream doesn't really accept that a lot of times
(umm) While while (stutter) the homosexual aspect is kind of brought up in this movie, and it it (stutter) is influenced (umm) by the mainstream, most of the movie focuses just on the two guys' relationship and how they try to make it work
It it (stutter) pretends as though it's just a normal couple who are doing a normal thing and never mind that they're homosexual, they're just out trying to (umm), you know, have a loving relationship and go on
I think that's kind of refreshing actually because (uhh) I found (uhh) a lot of the homosexual movies focus too much on, you know, the idea that they're being persecuted or that it's so hard to be gay in today's society or, you know, they're always looked down upon and they struggle through life
And this movie, while it kind of hints at that a little bit, it's definitely not its main focus and it it's (stutter) barely touched upon, actually
There is a lot of profanity in this movie, (umm) so if you're worried about that I wouldn't see it
(uhh) Not a lot of overtly sexual content
(umm) Obviously, you're going to see a bunch of good looking guys in in various states of undress, but not any, you know, graphic sexual depictions, or anything like that
(umm) There is a little bit of race issue in this, too, because one of the guys is white and one of the guys is a minority
So it's interesting to see not only are they gay and struggling to deal with that, with each other, they're also (uhh), you know, the race issue comes into play a couple of times, as well
So there's kind of a lot of dynamics going on here
(umm) One one (stutter) of the main things I didn't like about the movie is that the two main actors aren't very good
I don't think they get into their roles enough
(uhh) They're homosexual in real life and so that aids them in playing gay men, but I don't think they embody their characters well enough
They don't make you feel like they're actually who they say they are
(umm) If you've been left feeling empty by other movies before, you know what that feels like when a character doesn't sell it right you kinda, you know, you're left hallow
You're left like, "Well I paid good money for this
Why aren't they going to, you know, work hard for me?" And I think you'll get that a lot in this movie
A supporting cast, I would say is equal to that or even worse
(uhh) Some scenes, I've see, I mean guys looking off just kinda bored and like they're not even wanting to be part of this movie
And I, if you've seen a lot of movies, you kinda know what that looks like and you can kinda pick up on that
(uhh) Maybe if you haven't seen as many movies, you won't notice some of the supporting actors being bored
But you will notice the main actors just kinda not flowing very well together
(uhh) I haven't seen any other movies with either of them in it, so I don't know what they're normally like
I don't know th if this is, you know, how they are in all their movies, or if they just weren't into this movie
And the two main actors (uhh) actually were writers of this movie as well, so it makes me think, that it's not that they weren't into the movie, it's just kinda how they act
Which is kinda disappointing
I would have liked to see it with a more well known lead actor, (umm) who really wanted to get into the role
I'm only going to give this a one of five star
Don't worry about seeing this in theater
Rent this one
There's nothing that you're going to miss
(uhh) And you're gonna save a few bucks, as well
(umm) If you don't like gay movies, if you don't like the homosexual issue, obviously, this isn't gonna be a movie for you
(umm) But if you don't mind that kind of thing, and you're into a little light discussion about how, you know, a gay couple tries to make things work, you might be mildly entertained
What's up, ExpoTV? I saw a movie called Don't You Don't Mess With the Zohan
(uhh) It's starring, I guess, Adam Sandler
And (uhh) you really don't want to even mess with this movie, to be completely honest
It was absolutely terrible, probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen in theaters
(uhh) It's it's it's (stutter) about how how (stutter) this guy, he's, like, this, like, secret agent, but he fakes his own death, and he moves to New York City and (uhh) he wants to be, like, a hair stylist, but then he also still has, like, his, like, spy skills, where he can, like, beat people up, like like (stutter) crazy, in crazy ways and stuff
(uhh) It's supposed to be, like, one of those, like, I guess outrageously funny movies, and it really, like, wasn't
The the (stutter) preview pretty much shows you what the whole movie is
(uhh) Like that trailer (uhh) he kicks people really weird that's, like, not realistic, like, he's supposed to be, like, this super super (stutter) agent, super hair stylist
And it's just like, kind of like making fun of, like (stutter), everyone, but it's, like, really stupid
I I (stutter) thought that, like, Adam Sandler was starting to make better movies, but, like, he's definitely gotten worse and worse
(uhh) So I really would not bother with with (stutter) You Don't Mess With the Zohan at all, like, not even on DVD, absolutely nothing
(uhh) I don't know where he got the idea for this, but it really is absolutely terrible
(uhh) It has, like, the same cast as all his other movies, like, Rob Schneider, people like that
But, like but like (stutter) the story and the whole plot, it was just absolutely terrible
So (uhh) I would have to give You Don't Mess With the Zohan (uhh) one out of five
Do not see this movie
Please don't see it
Hi
(uhh) Today I am reviewing the movie Incredible Hulk which is currently playing in theaters nationwide
(uhh) Now Incredible Hulk is a sequel to the movie, The Hulk and (uhh) let me tell you I wasn't a big fan of The Hulk but I saw all these trailers of Incredible Hulk and it looked so much action packed that I decided to go watch this movie
(umm) I think that would be the biggest mistake that I've done this year of actually going to watch watch (stutter) this movie and (uhh) let me tell you this again that you know all these movies that are coming out in summer (umm) you know which are really anticipated and what not
I am sure Incredible Hulk is the worst of all of those which have already released and which are going to release again so it's really bad and let me tell you why
So Hulk ended somewhere that you know so he he's (stutter) (uhh) kinda running away from the army and what not so this movie starts that this guy now wants to cure himself and (uhh) he's not in North America anymore
He's somewhere in Central America hiding away from the army because they still want him
And (uhh) out of whatever less than two hours movie, only ten minutes is when you know the hulk is actually on the screen, the rest, it's this guy planning how to, kind of you know, get away, cure himself (uhh) from being the hulk because that's basically his heart rate goes up and he turns into the hulk
(uhh) Another thing that the trailers showed was was (stutter) another guy, (umm) you know the size of hulk and looked really evil and I waited pretty much the entire movie for this guy to show up and he just showed up for the last ten, fifteen minutes and I I (stutter) pretty much slept in the movie you know
I was sleeping forty minutes into the movie, was that boring
(umm) Because I thought of it as action packed, it was not
Another thing I noticed (uhh) was the animation part, it seems that they have just focused on the bodies of these two you know the Hulk and the evil guy
The rest and you know, the blast and the helicopter crashes and what not
The animations was really poor
Like you can tell its, its (stutter) computer animated and it's really bad
Like I would expect this kind of animations back in the nineteen-nineties but it is two-thousand eight and no one expect that kind of animations
It was really disappointing
(uhh) The the (stutter) direction was okay and the acting was okay but the story line was (uhh) (stutter) The story just didn't move at all
It, it (stutter) was just there and it was like you know they could have ended the movie in ten minutes if they wanted to
There are two types of people in this world people who like M
Night Shyamalan films and people who do not like M
Night Shyamalan films
I am one who does
This is a completely unbiased review against M
Night Shyamalan
I actually loved his first three films
I mean, I loved his first three films
The Village and Lady in the Water were complete letdowns for me
And I said to myself, if this one, The Happening, is not as good as his first three, I am going to say I'm not going to go see his movies anymore
And I think that's the way it's going to be
The movie was absolutely terrible
It wasn't, like, the worst movie ever made, like some people are saying, but it was pretty awful
(umm) The idea, as far-fetched as it is in the movie, is probably the best part of the movie
The idea he came up with for the movie, that was probably the best part
But everything about the movie, the dialog, the acting, the casting (umm), the pace, the tone, the plot, where it goes, the scary moments, the gore, all that that I just named is awful
It is just awful
It is just awful
Now, I have to make this review kind of short
And I wish I could I could (stutter) talk longer
I could probably go on for, like, ten minutes about it, but I can't
(umm) I'm going to tell you really fast why that's all bad and, like I said, the best part about the movie was just the idea
(umm) Even the, even (stutter) how long it was
It was only an hour and a half
And I know a lot of movies are an hour and a half, but this one was really cut down
It could have, it could have (stutter) gone on for two hours
And I think that's what it should have been, but it wasn't
I mean, it was, that was a complete disappointment
You also don't care about the characters in the movie, if they die or not
You don't
I mean, I could go on forever, but sorry
The, (stutter) Mark Wahlberg is in this movie
Okay? And you think he's going to be, like, this awesome actor, but, you know, this is his worst performance of his career
And I'm sorry, Santa
And he holds the movie up
And that's very sad
It's the worst performance of his career, but yet he holds the movie up
He's probably the best one, best best (stutter) actor in the movie
That's sad
Zooey (stutter) Deschanel, just stop
Just stop
I don't even know what to say about you
Just take a year off and get your head together, because that, that (stutter) movie, it was just absolutely terrible
Your dialog, delivery, and everything about what you did, everything, everything about what you did was absolutely terrible
(umm) The storyline and the way it was written, like I said, the idea was good, but M
Night Shyamalan, take a break
Seriously
Come out with a movie every three years, maybe every four years even
(stutter) Just take more time on your movies
You seriously, this could have been, had so much more potential and it went nowhere and you didn't care
You really didn't
It was, it was (stutter) laughable
It really was
And the, the dialog was probably one of the, if not the worst part of the movie, besides the acting, which was really bad
Dialog, delivery, and just the dialog had a, how you wrote it, it was absolutely awful
It wasn't realistic at all
(umm) It was so bad, it was absolutely terrible
(uhh) What else? {Sigh} I, I'm (stutter) sorry
I really can't say anything good about the movie
Even, even, (stutter) another thing I just wanted to end with
You think it's going to be a scary movie, but it's not
There's only one scene where you're holding onto your seat and you're about to, you know, like, those scenes where you're waiting to jump? There's only one of them
There's only one scene
It doesn't even last that long
And you think, well, it's R-rated, so there's going to be a lot of gore, right? There's no gore
There's absolutely no gore
Every time you think you're about to see gore, it just cuts to a new scene
You don't see anything
I've seen more gore in the trailer of this movie
Okay? It's pathetic
(umm) I really, you know, like I said, I really wish I could go on forever about this movie, but, in a nutshell, I do not recommend this movie
All those reasons, plus a million more (umm) that makes this movie so bad
And the casting
I'm not saying Mark Wahlberg is not a good actor, because he is, but, first of all, not in this movie
And then, he doesn't play this character at all
He should not play this character at all
Okay? Because he's a science teacher
Okay? You do not, Mark Wahlberg, he's not a science teacher
And it doesn't matter that it's a movie, we're not going to believe that
So I do not recommend seeing this movie
And I am an M
Night Shyamalan fan, well, at least I was
Not after this movie
I doubt I'm going to see any more of his movies
The only reason I'd recommend seeing this movie is probably to laugh
And that's, that's (stutter) completely honest
And I will, I really wish I couldn't say that, because I do love the guy
Like I said, I did
But I can't
I can't
I really cannot recommend this movie
I can't say anything good about it
So do not go see this movie
It is laughable
You are seriously wasting your money
Okay
You seriously are
It is, is that bad
Hi guys
(umm) Today I'll be reviewing the movie The Happening
(umm) This movie just released this week and it's been directed by M
Night Shyamalan and written by M
Night Shyamalan
And so most of you know M
Night Shyamalan he's famous for some movie like (umm) the one of the great escape, (umm) Sixth Sense
(umm) But he also made some movies like the Lady In Water
So I, so in my mind it cause kind of mixed feeling like whether it's gonna be like (umm) The Sign or it's gonna be like The Happening
(umm) So xxx I just, I went to the theater to watch this movie and let me firstly tell you it's not that good movie
If I were rate Sixth Sense as a ten out of ten I would give this movie just like two out of ten
Because (umm) in all the movie you are just like (umm) they they're (stutter) gonna open suspense, they're gonna open the suspense now, now, now but
(umm) To a standard movie for still like a misleading (umm) a storyline
So in this movie (umm) the main leading character a science teacher played by Eric Moore (umm) the character Erik Moore is being playing by Mark Wahlberg
And he is the main leading character
(umm) In this movie he is shown as a science teacher and to his point of the (stutter) amusement that (umm) he found that something strange is happening all around the northeast (umm) coast of the country
(umm) So they they (stutter) cannot figure out what's actually happening
(umm) So in the movie you see like (umm) something return two or three and depressing xxx say totally sharp so if you are taking your children be careful because there are gonna be some scenes which could be like, so many people dead lying on the street or hanging on the tree
So that's a little scary and you don't you don't (stutter) want your children to look at those (umm) scenes
So warning for that
(umm) So this movie (umm) like, I do not want to disclose the suspense but there is a bit of suspense in this movie (umm) that this, only this guy was saved just from the whole northeast coast just so the guy was like
and then after sometime like xxx show up that this guy's letting his (umm) regular life and then the same thing happens some other place
(umm) That's that's (stutter) the point where the movie ends
So in this movie (umm) I would just say that (umm) probably gonna give this movie like a two out of five
Because the movie (umm) yeah, the most important thing I wanna share about this is that the starting of the movie, it just happened like real fun that something is happening, something is happening it's not like you set a bag down and then start on the storyline
So and in the first scene they have shown that something is happening to the city
And so that scene is continued to the end of the movie
So as I say I'm gonna give this movie two out of five
Hey Expo TV, today I'm reviewing The Happening
(umm) This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen and that's not even a lie
I've I've (stutter) seen a lot of really bad movies, I walked out of a couple movies
And I would have walked out of this one if I hadn't been praying for M
Night Shyamalan to pull something at the very end
(umm) Mark Wahlberg was terrible, he will never get a job after this hopefully, because he was so bad in this movie
And M
Night Shyamalan wanted this to be campy and like a two hour long Twilight Zone and with even worse actors than they had back in the day
(umm) They were actually really good in Twilight Zone, this is this is (stutter) that was a insult to the Twilight Zone this is a terrible movie
(umm) I know people are rooting for M
Night Shyamalan I know that you know, he hasn't made a movie since Lady In the Water, god forbid that movie too
He's just on, (stutter) he hit his peak at twenty-three years old, like this kid he he (stutter) doesn't know what he's doing any more
The Sixth Sense was a beautiful movie, it was a beautiful film I love that film
(uhh) Unbreakable was pretty good
(uhh) Signs, awesome
(uhh) And then there came The Village which was not great but it was still okay
There was the twist there we counted on M
Night Shyamalan for that, we were like, oh it's the twist and then it came and you're like (uhh)
But you know what, that was okay
Mainly Lady In the Water which was just an atrocity, and The Happening was even worse
It's people running away from wind
Yup
For twenty-four hours and that's it
They're just running away from wind because it's carrying, well there's actually no real (stutter) explanation really but they think the trees are trying to poison them because it makes the part of their brain, some chemical part in their brain shut off (umm) so they all kill themselves
So I think what M
Night Shyamalan really wanted to do was make a movie where he could just have people kill themselves in the most creative ways possible, because that's all this was
And it wasn't even that gory, like
It could have been so much more, it really could have been but Mark Wahlberg just killed it, he killed it
It, he was so unreal in this movie
I mean even in one part an old lady's like, you're gonna kill me in my sleep and he's like, what, no
Like come on, have some emotion, like, don't sound like me {laughter} sound like a man who's like (uhh) and Zoey Deschanel I like her too but she just did a very poor job in this movie
But like I said maybe he meant it to be really campy and really silly and if he did, good job
But even then don't go see it, don't even see it as a satire, it's not worth it
It's a terrible film
Terrible
M
Night Shyamalan has got to get back on track, we need another Signs, we need another Sixth Sense, we need another Unbreakable
These were all great films, these were amazing films
He can get back into that, I don't know what's wrong with him why is he doing this, I'm really pissed off at this movie
I was looking forward to this film all summer
I was so psyched about it because I figured it was the comeback, it's the first R-rated movie, it's gonna be grotesque, it's gonna be twisted, it's gonna be awesome
No, do not waste your money on this film
Don't even waste renting it on DVD
If it comes on cable, see it then
That's all I can say, don't do not (stutter) see this movie
There's nothing more I can say
I give it one star because it's the lowest I can go but if I could go lower I would
The Happening, don't see it, it will waste your time and it will make you so sad for everyone involved, especially M
Night Shyamalan because I don't know
He must have a stroke or something between films because this is just so bad I don't know why he thought this would be a good idea
M
Night Shyamalan get your act together and Mark Wahlberg, (uhh) go back to Marky Mark that's what you gotta do but do not go back on film
(umm) And Zoey I've got hope for you, but don't trust M
Night Shyamalan again
Okay, The Happening, do not see this film
What's up expo tv
(uhh) I have a review for a movie called The Happening
(uhh) This movie recently came out about two weeks ago
It's and it's (stutter) rated R for violent violent (stutter) images
(uhh) It's like a, it's starring Mark Wahlberg
(uhh) That's all I really recognize from the movie
And it's from like the producer of (uhh) or, of like (uhh) Signs and this, (stutter) Sixth Sense
And (uhh) the movie is about how there's this like, (stutter) parent, this like, random thing and just, (stutter) like threating off like like like (stutter) it, like basically every person
And it's just making them do crazy stuff and like everyone's just like dying and stuff it's really, really weird
(uhh) But it was interesting but it was like kind of like, this can't be happening like, what like, what's going on why are all these people just going crazy
Because like, just something in the like, air or something
So I thought it was kind of like weird
But you but you (stutter) guys might like it
(uhh) It was I guess it was like definitely along the lines of Signs and like Sixth Sense, of those movies
But it wasn't as good
It was just like, a little bit more like violent and I guess that's why it they rated it R
But (uhh) it's not like scary, it doesn't really freak you out or, or nike huarache so myself so if you're looking to go see a scary movie, do not see this this (stutter) movie
It's not good
So so so (stutter) I would have to give The Happening a two out of five
What's up Expo TV
I have a (stutters) movie review for a Mike Meyers new movie called The Love Guru
Came out last week
Like there's been a lot of trailers for it
(uhh) it's ninety minutes long
It's rated PG-thirteen for crude and sexual content, language, some violence and drug references
(uhh) The movie's about how he was adopted by a by gurus
Like who are basically like, like, like, (stutter) they know everything about dating and love and stuff and (uhh) like he gets sent on this mission to like, I guess help out a marriage between between (stutter) Toronto Maple Leafs player and like his wife because his wife has been seeing a guy from from the Los Angeles Kings
So (uhh) It's So it's like so it's like (stutter) how like he's like trying to help out this marriage
But like it really doesn't work cause it's supposed to be really funny
It's like Mike Myers does stuff like Wayne's World and like Austin Powers and stuff
So like this movie isn't supposed to be like a romantic comedy or something
It's like just like a, really dull comedy I thought
I really don't like Mike Myers that much
I think he's definitely overrated
And this movie it (stutter) should, like the trailer should not be getting as many like slots, like during commercials that it's it's (stutter) like, getting cause it's really not good
(uhh) But see it I guess, if you like Mike Myers
It's not as good as like, it's not as good as Austin Powers or anything
But (uhh) It's called The Love Guru
(uhh) A couple cameo like appearances from from (stutter) players on the Toronto Maple Leafs and from the Los Angeles Kings so check it out if you want to
Hello, my name is Mike, and today I'll be talking to you about the movie The Love Guru starring Mike Myers
As formality here's my movie ticket, and there we go
So, what'd I think about this movie? Mike Myers is usually pretty funny
I mean (uhh) Austin Powers was pretty hilarious, almost all of them were
(uhh) Wayne's World was funny
Love Guru not so much
I mean it's not that Love Guru doesn't have at least a few funny jokes
It's just primarily that most of the movie is really crude and, you know, for a guy that usually does humor that's a little better than this, I mean it can be slapstick and silly, but not usually quite this level of just crude stupidness
Makes you wonder what he's thinking when he decided to make this movie
You know I always thought that Austin Powers was pretty juvenile, but in reality it was actually a fairly good level of intellect
Sort of a James Bondy joke, you know? And you really only realize this after watching this movie when you go "Oh
It could have been a lot stupider"
Which is exactly what this movie is, it's stupid
It's about a guy, India, wants to learn to be, you know, a guru so girls will like him
You know, it's even the line that he uses in the preview
So, you know, he becomes this guru and sort of this idea of like ahh it's the horny, chastised love guru
He's kind of a dork and the stuff he says is just sort of ridiculous most of the time, and the advice he gives is horrible and sorta questions whether or not it's any good at all
In reality I really feel this movie is like, yeah, (umm) it's about on par with some of the stupid Saturday Night Live sketches
You know, not even the good ones, but about the stupid ones
Which, you know, are best tolerated for about two minutes
So a full length movie is really hard to pull off with this premise, you know? The premise itself might have been good, might have been workable, but this is definitely not a workable version of it
So I'm going to give The Love Guru a one out of five
(umm) Rent it maybe? See it at a super budget price maybe? But (uhh) it's questionable whether or not you should even do that
So Love Guru one out of five for being a very crude, very juvenile adaptation of a not so great premise
Hello, playing over my shoulder is this movie
This movie is called The Signal
I didn't like this movie and I'll tell you why
It's because three people, three different people, wrote it and directed it (uhh) all separately
(uhh) It utilizes pretty much the same cast from beginning to end and it's about (umm) (uhh) some sort of a strange signal that is (uhh) broadcast from an (uhh) unspecified source (uhh) over television waves and (uhh) radio waves and cellular phones, and regular phone lines
And (uhh) it just drives people insane, it (uhh) makes them want to just you know, wig out and start killing each other
And the first third of the movie I really enjoyed, I thought it was a really solid setup (umm) for a pretty good horror movie
It felt like something along the lines of twenty-eight days later
And it just, it felt really solid and like it was going to be a good movie
And in the middle of the movie (umm) tried really, really hard (uhh) to be funny and failed spectacularly
(uhh) It was it was (stutter) not funny at all, I like maybe laughed, I'd say maybe five times, one time pretty hard at something that happened, (umm) but (uhh) over the course of forty minutes laughing five times at a part that is (uhh) supposed to be funny from start to finish, (umm) that just doesn't, didn't cut it for me
(uhh) So (uhh) and there was one character in particular that was just incredibly annoying (uhh) in the middle of it
His name was (uhh) Jim Parsons and I absolutely hated him
(uhh) There is no way that any normal human being would invite him to a party
(umm) I'm going to hold this up here to block something out
{laugh} (umm) Yeah I really didn't like this movie at, at, at (stutter) all
The first third of it was, was (stutter) pretty good
The middle of it totally ruined everything that came before and after it
And (umm) the final third was mixed, it was okay
(umm) Special features (uhh) include (uhh) deleted scenes, a making of (uhh) featurette, and (uhh) yeah plenty of making of featurettes and (uhh) director's commentaries, so (uhh) (uhh) I I I (stutter) don't recommend the special features, (uhh) I I (stutter) can't because I didn't watch them because I didn't like this movie (uhh) enough to watch them, so I don't recommend this movie
Hey what's up Expo TV? (umm) Stephen Boyd here (uhh) here to talk about a movie I saw about a week ago
(umm) And I was hoping I would forget about it, that's why I haven't done a review on it yet
(umm) It was a depressing experience (uhh) to say the least
It was a movie called The Happening, and it was bad, it was really really bad
(umm) Here's the thing, it was written and directed by, I can never say this guy's name right,M
Night Shamylan I think
M
Night Shmamalan or something like that
But anyways
It's written and directed by him
You all know him
He did The Sixth Sense
He did Signs
(umm) Those movies
And I really love those movies and I, I (stutter) though, you know his other movies weren't as bad as people made them seem, you know they weren't like fantastic, but this movie is just terrible
(umm) Everyones making a big deal because it was his first R rated movie
I was like Oh okay well, you know there's a reason it's probably rated R and it just kinda sucked
Like I was hopping there'd be more violence because if you go to a rated R movie about like
Oh yeah I guess I should tell you a little bit about the plot
Basically it's like a family on the run from like this, this (stutter) natural crisis that's taking people over and like making them kill themselves in really horrific way, and in the previews you see like three or four people killing themselves and you're like oh my gosh that's really intense, this is gonna be a really intense movie
But no, the the (stutter) three or four times you see it happening in the previews are the only times it happens in the movie
So basically you could save yourself the time, go on Youtube and watch the preview of the movie, and you would get all the most intense parts of the movie in that preview
(uhh) The rest of the movie (stutter) stunk
(uhh) Mark Wahlberg, terrible, terrible actor
So unbelievable
Dude is so bad, it's just like embarrassing, some of the acting he does
And (uhh) yeah, it just wasn't good
And he, M
Night Shamalyan is always in his own movies
Which, sometimes it's not bad
In this one it's just like stupid
I don't know, he's not a very good actor either
But (umm) don't even rent this movie
It was so bad
There's so many better things you could do with your time
You could like, go watch (umm) all the videos that Expo TV rejected for two hours, or an hour and a half, and that would be a better (uhh) better way to spend your time than to see this movie
So one out of five stars for this movie
It really let me down and also because I gave him a chance
I was like oh, I like your other movies, I'll see this one
Really disappointed, don't waste your time
So we’re the Ohio state university, so we definitely have a passionate feel for all our big ten colleagues out there.
And every time we see a transcript from a comparable institution then we know that students that come from the University of Illinois are well prepared.
I just returned from the movies
If you want to waste your time go see one called The Love Guru
That's G U R U
Guru, okay? Has Ben Kingsley in it
It's got Mike Myers, he's the, the (stutter) main character
(uhh) Jessica Alba, Justin Timberlake, Jessica Simson
Simpson
It's got a few others in there (uhh) that you will probably have heard about and usually when a movie has a lot of different people in it that you know about it's usually not gonna be very good and this one wasn't
Mike Myers is absolutely awful
He (stutter) co-wrote this movie from what I understand and it's just, it's just absolutely horrid
The best thing about the movie was that it's only eighty-seven minutes long so you don't have to endure too much
It's supposed to be a comedy but you'll go in there and you'll be waiting to laugh but you never will, and then it'll be time to go
So I wouldn't recommend this movie at all
I'd say (stutter) there's much more movies out there that are (uhh) so much more better than this
Hey expotv, today I'm gonna review the movie that's currently in theaters (umm) and that movie would be Hellboy Two
(umm) Hellboy Two, I wasn't all that excited to go see this but you know, people are going to see it so I was like, whatever I'll go and it definitely didn't live up to even my low expectations
I thought it was worse than what I thought it would be
(umm) By the way the subtitle to this movie is Hellboy Two and the Golden Army
Pretty much it's more just rampaging through Hellboy beating people down and saying clever little phrases
(umm) I don't know, something about the whole Hellboy theme I don't really like, personally
You know, it's another one of these blockbusters from a comic book
So you know if you're a, if you're (stutter) a Hellboy fan you'll probably like it actually, but if you're just a general viewer I highly doubt you'll enjoy it, just because you don't really have any connection to it and it's just not good
If you don't have a connection it probably won't be good cause it's it's (stutter) just annoying
This is Blood: The Last Vampire
It's a anime
It's considered like a masterpiece
A lot of people highly recommend this
I watched it, I didn't think it was that great
They even made a series after it, based off of the movie
The story, by the time it got started, it was already over
It didn't actually start taking root til the very end of the like the last thirty minutes of the movie and by that time it was already over
The animation, the graphics of it, it was it looked really good in some parts, and it some parts it looked horrible
But a lot of people praised it for its graphics at the time
I, I (stutter) didn't see it so much
(uhh) I'd say it was the average anime
Hey, ExpoTV
Aubs eighty four here today to talk to you about the movie the Ripple Effect, which is currently in theaters
(umm) This movie is kind of low budget and doesn't feature a lot of well-known actors or actresses
(uhh) Forest Whitaker and Minnie Driver are the two that I recognized and that I have seen in other films
(umm) The basic storyline of this movie is that there is a Hollywood (uhh) director and his life has kind of fallen apart, his marriage, his finances, his relationships
Everything is kind of going downhill
And the idea is that these changes kind of ripple out and affect all aspects of his life and lead to new things
So just like if you throw a rock in a, in a (stutter) pool of water, (umm) the ripples kind of go out and they alter and affect all the water around them
In the same same (stutter) (uhh) stance, when his personal life kind of falls apart, it ripples out and affects this guy's professional life as well
(umm) Fortunately, though, this guy does not let that ruin him or bring him down
It actually leads to a sort of awakening or revival, and he sets out to change a few things and to make his life better and to try to take, take (stutter) things into his own hands and do what he can to right all the situations
Now, I don't know if this movie is (uhh) very well done, quite honestly
(umm) It kind of seems like Minnie Driver and Forest Whitaker have had much better performances
And the main actor in this one also, even though I've never seen him before, I have to believe that he's had better performances like this
He doesn't seem to embody the character very well
I just don't picture this guy as as (stutter), I don't (stutter) picture the actor actually being this guy, going through this really hard time and, and (stutter) struggling through his life, as he deals with his marriage and everything else
He doesn't sell it very well, in other words
(umm) A poor job in that respect
And I think that, like the movie says, ripples out and affects the rest of the cast as well
(umm) As I mentioned, the supporting actors and actresses kind of don't live up to the billing, they don't live up to (umm) what they could have done and what they have done in some of their other roles
So I was let down, quite honestly
(umm) I had heard little about the film before I saw it, but what I had heard was positive and, and, (stutter) your know, uplifting and thinking that it was going to be a good movie
(umm) But, like I said, everything put together here wasn't
The soundtrack was downer
It was kind of depressing in parts and it just didn't rebound to give the highs to the positive notes of the movie like it should have
So even though it, the music dragged you down with a sad part of the movie, it did not bring you back up when it turned around and got happy
And I don't want to ruin anything, give away any plot spoilers or anything like that, (uhh) but things, you know, get better
When, when (stutter) he has an awakening, you can kind of expect that things are going to look up from there
One thing to make the movie better, I think, I think (stutter) when it goes into the actual writing and directing, I don't think the writer or director brought out what they could have in these actors and actresses
Now, the writer just writes it and kind of leaves it at that, but a lot of them tweak it (uhh) based on what the (umm) actors' and actresses' input is
So, for instance, if they think this scene might work a little bit better this way, or if the director suggest that (umm) this scene might be better dialogued this way, you know, the writer writes that in and makes changes
But I just don't see that being done
Maybe he was just given bad advice and made changes for the worse, or maybe, like I think, the actors, actresses, and director just weren't in this one wholeheartedly
I'm only going to give it a one out of five stars
Not a whole lot of redeeming quality about this movie
(uhh) Save your money
ExpoTV, this is Aubs eighty four and I'm going to talk to you today about the movie The Doorman, which is currently in theaters
(umm) This is a very low-quality film, very low budget, nobody (uhh) of any kind of (umm) ability actually in acting is in this film (umm) no well-known actors, no well-known actresses, nobody directing or even writing it that you probably would have ever heard of
It follows the story of a doorman in New York City, or basically a bouncer at one of the clubs
And he's very popular, very well known
(uhh) He kind of goes on a big power trip about how he can get people into this club and how he knows all these people and blah, blah, blah
And it's all about him and his life and he's so cool
(uhh) But eventually, he loses his job and he comes crashing down to earth (uhh) when he loses his job because he realizes he pretty much has nothing to go on
(uhh) The people he knew and were so friendly with, I mean, they don't talk to him anymore since the, he can't get them into any clubs
They were basically using him for (uhh) his position at the door
And they weren't really friends at all
And he kind of tries to come to terms with this, has to get a grip on things and realize what's actually going on in his life and what he has going for him
Now, that that (stutter) may sound like it has some potential and it may be going somewhere and it could be, you know, some big story about self-revelation or interesting of the fact that he knows all these people and it could be synopses of people's lives that come to the club and the information he can get from them, and, you know, just kind of cool, it could be kind of like a back, (uhh) behind-the-scenes type of cool thing about these popular people
(umm) However, it's nothing like that
It's actually quite terrible
It is basically a big ego trip by this doorman guy (umm) and how he wallows in self-pity and self-realization when it turns out that he actually has nothing
The writing (umm) was pathetic, (uhh) quite frankly
The story goes nowhere
It's basically a big circle
He wakes up one day, feels sorry for himself, tries to get over it, can't, goes out, gets shunned by these people he's tied to, comes back, and crashes, gets drunk and is worthless
Gets up the next morning and it goes around in a circle again
Gets up the next morning and it goes, anyway, you get the idea
It keeps going round and round and round
Same thing over and over and over again
Not worth seeing, not worth renting, not worth wasting your life over, quite frankly
The soundtrack is nonexistent, for the most part
Not that it could have added much to a movie like this, but still, at least maybe some good music would have redeemed it in a small way
But not even that
So it's all downhill
(umm) Nobody can really act in this one
It all keeps, seems very staged, very set up, nobody is acting natural, nobody is getting into their roles, and nobody is meshing with one another
It's almost as if they're all competing with each other to get a space and to try to get themselves known so they can go to Hollywood and make a real good film
I would say that this movie should have gone straight to DVD or straight to the garbage, quite frankly
(uhh) One out of five stars is what I have to give it because I can't give a zero out of five stars
Do not waste your time on this one
Hi
Today I'm reviewing Hellboy Two
It's currently playing in theaters right now
(uhh) I went to go see this movie (umm) and it was a big disappointment
From the trailers it looked (uhh) really action packed and exciting and (umm) kind of like a fairy tale with a darker side
But (uhh) when I saw it I was just unimpressed
(umm) The little side jokes weren't funny at all, and the acting was just kind of so bland and just the overall presentation and performance of everything about this movie it just wasn't satisfactory for me
And I just expected so much more from it
So I didn't enjoy it a whole lot at all
(umm) If I had to give it a rating I'd say it's a two out of five for me
(umm) It just (uhh) I didn't enjoy it
It had so much potential and it could have been a whole lot better but it was just pretty poorly done
And so I wouldn't recommend to see it, but (umm) I guess the target audience would be people in my age group
(umm) Young people in their twenties, thirties, or young children like teenagers, or even little (uhh) ten-year-olds they may enjoy this cause it's (uhh) I mean they may find the jokes funny but I didn't
It was just (uhh) not adult humor I guess
And (uhh) so, yeah
Didn't like it
That's it
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
I'm gonna just come out right and say it
Do not go see this movie
It fails on every level possible
They shouldn't have not even made the movie
They probably even shouldn't have made the second one to be honest
And (uhh) there's, I can't really say one good thing about this movie
(umm) The casting, Rachel Weisz, is not a return a big problem there
Big problem
It really has an effect on the movie
You don't love the characters as much cause the original actress that played Brendan Fraser's wife is not back
Brendan Fraser just fails entirely
He's not funny anymore, he's getting older, and the whole hero guy who tries to be funny with the one-liners, just just (stutter) stop
Just, it's terrible
The plot it has nothing to do with the first or second Mummy anymore, which is you know, it's a good idea you know? Maybe get away from that
But you don't care, you really don't care about the tomb of the Dragon Emperor, this Dragon Emperor guy, you don't care
(umm) The special effects are way too over the top and not only are they over the top, but they are fake
You can it's it's (stutter) insulting
It is insulting the way they are
(umm) And I'm not trying to be like, mean about it like you need to do better but they do need to do better
I mean the public is so used to special effects and computer effects now that we expect a lot more and we are being insulted by this movie
Everything about it, the special effects you can tell are fake and they're just trying to put so much action on you and and (stutter) CGI and special effects that like the movie and the plot just are completely lost and they're just trying to throw that to make up for it
So really and it doesn't make up for it at all
So I do not recommend seeing this movie
It was in a way it was entertaining, in a way
But really it's not worth your money
I I (stutter) think if you took your kids to go see it I think I think teenage audiences or them might enjoy it but really, it's that great a movie
I think it's (stutter) I think it's gonna fail (umm) on all levels
Really I don't think it's good at all
Really, I mean just, you gotta go see it
You gotta know what I'm talking about
It's just old
The Mummy franchise is dead, or they need to reboot it or something because Brendan Fraser's one-liners in all this stuff, it's just the public's not gonna take it anymore
It's really boring, it's old, it's cheesy
It it (stutter) was old five years ago, seriously so just stop it
(umm) I guess the good thing about the movie was it was it was (stutter) so it was it was (stutter) so like bad that it was entertaining cause like, you kinda lose yourself in it in the fact that it's not real
I mean obviously it's not gonna be real, you know, a mummy coming to life but like it's just so over the top that it's like somewhat entertaining you know what I mean
Like it's just so unbelievable that you just gotta sit back and kind of enjoy the ride while you go along with it
So that's that's (stutter) one good thing I'd say about it
Other than that though I do not recommend this movie at all
Do not go see it really
Do not waste your money on it
Or if you're going to, go see matinee or something cheaper, seriously
I just, I think you're gonna get bored with it
It's just too much CGI, too much action and it's it's (stutter) over the top, it really is
So don't go see it in my opinion
It's not good
Hello everybody, my name is Mike, and today I'll be talking to you about the movie Curse of the Dragon Emperor
As formality, here is my movie ticket
Here it is again, and this time in slo-mo
mommy vision whoo
Alright so the movie is called Curse of the Dragon Emperor
(uhh) That's not what it should be called
It should be called, why do you keep making this series
The first one was alright, I will admit that
It was actually a fairly good movie
And from that point on they've all been sort of been downhill
With this one probably being the worst one
This is probably gonna go down as one of the dumbest movies ever made
So basic premise, (umm) in the distant past a few thousand years ago
Chinese Emperor was imprisoned in a sort of suspended animation cryogenic state
Except for without freezing
And, so him and his army are disguised as the Terracotta Army and the guy from the first previous movies are (umm) accidentally wakes him up and now that guy's gonna try to take over the world
Yeah, so number one, there's no mummy, technically
(uhh) Number two, that's not that clever of a plot
You know, it's it's (stutter) sort of clever, you're like, oh well, I can take like vaguely historical things and sort of thread it together to be something (umm) junky
But that's really all that is
It's not that great, cause really even in the end, it's just a vague rehashing of the previous ones
So the story itself is not done very well
It just, they didn't add anything new to it for me at a previous incarnations, besides the old, let's just set it in a different location
And it's not in Egypt anymore now, it's in China
It's still the same thing
No one does a very good job on their acting
Not a single actor whatsoever
So, dialogue is bad
I haven't mentioned that yet, but I am right now
Dialogue's bad, acting's bad, the story's bad
And (umm) so yeah, this series needs to stop
It's not worth seeing
I, this isn't worth seeing
It's not worth renting
It's not even worth seeing at your friends house, for free
It's stupid
Let it die
Don't go see it
At least that might convince people, hey we should stop making these movies and maybe make something new for once
So this has been Mike, saying hey, it's not good, don't see it
One out of five, boohoo
I'm going away now
Hey, hey
My name is Mike and today I'll be talking to you about the movie Swing Vote
As formality, here is my movie ticket
And there we go
So the basic premise of this movie is as follows: Kevin Costner plays a character who is just sort of the (uhh) lame sort of loser
He, you know, doesn't really give a care about anything
And (uhh) so his life is just sort of passing him by
His daughter tries to get him to vote, so he goes and votes, and it causes a screw-up that la-de-dah-de-dah
Big surprise
Causing it so that his vote is the one that decides the presidential election
Okay
Well, that's a pretty unlikely-sounding premise, but let's run with it for a second
So then the rest of the movie falls upon the idea of, hey, look at him becoming blobbity-blobbity, look at him deciding the election, all the things that sort of happen
Everyone is trying to get his opinion
He can't really decide, for a while, doesn't care
He starts to care a little
And (uhh), well, it's supposed to sort of have the message that everyone's vote matters and voting is important and look at the American political system
If anything, all it does is bore people of the American political system even more
This movie is dull, dull as dirt, duller than dirt
If there was something duller than dirt, that would be it
It's, there's nothing really exciting
Kevin Costner put in an all-right performance, but that's not enough to save the fact that this movie just isn't very good
You know? The premise is sort of laughable
The implementation is meh, thumbs down
And so then you're just end with, you know, it's a political movie that's supposed to be like, oh, sort of satirical a little, but it's not very satirical
So what you end up with is they took a movie that, they took two movies, really, one that's sort of the Disney culture movie of, hey, look, we're making a family-friendly movie
But that fails because it's boring and can't hold anyone's attention, a child or an adult
And then they sort of had a sort of, hey, let's make a satirical political movie
And that sort of fails because it's not well done
They didn't satirize (stutter) anything to a sufficient degree
You know, it just sort of felt, so then you try to put it together and neither one succeeds
So, Swing Vote, Kevin Costner, one out of five
You know, the only reason I liked this movie in any way, shape, or form is because I like reviewing bad movies
So, Mike here, saying one out of five
Goodbye
I went to the movies to see Pineapple Express
It wasn't my choice of movie to see, but I was outvoted on that one
It was okay
(umm) I I'm (stutter) really not into movies about stoners and drugs and stuff like that
And that's what the Pineapple Express movie is
(umm) It stars Seth Rogen, who has been in just about every (uhh) movie lately, it seems like
He was in the movie Stepbrothers
(umm) He was in the movie, the voice of a, one of the characters in Kung Fu Panda
He was in Knocked Up and Superbad
And he's really making a name for himself lately
I just didn't really think this was the best movie to go see
(umm) Pineapple Express (uhh) the movie got its name because that's supposedly the name of a new new (stutter) strain of marijuana
And (uhh) (uhh) and they talk about that during the movie
It's definitely not for kids
It's just for adults
(umm) If you're not into what I would call a drug movie, you probably wouldn't like it
It was okay
It passed the time
It's not one that I would recommend to people to go see
They would probably find another movie that they would like better
Hello
I want to talk to you about Death Race starring Jason Statham
(uhh) This movie is sort of a B movie by design
It is produced by Roger Corman who is very famous for directing a lot of movies, especially during the sixties and seventies
It's basic plot story, you know, you take (uhh) some cars and some women and a hero and throw it all together, throw in some violence, and you have a movie
And that was basically his career
He produced (stutter) a lot of car movies back in the day
He actually produced one called (uhh) Death Race Two-thousand
(uhh) Some people thought that this was a sequel to that movie, or a remake of that movie
It's not really
It's got some similarities but it's not really what I would call a remake of that movie
This movie involves a man (uhh) (stutter) or a hero, Jason, who is accused of killing his wife and he has to go to prison
He's wrongly accused I should say
And (uhh) once there he gets involved in sort of a underground race to the death (uhh) with the prisoners
And the plot beyond that is basically there is no plot beyond that
There's a lot of explosions and a lot of violence, and (uhh) the action is pretty good but all in all I kind of miss the plot
I I (stutter) like some of the older B movies but but (stutter) when they try to update it and kind of make it into an A movie but keep the B movie plot it just didn't work
College
Starring, who cares? Written by, it doesn't matter
It doesn't even matter anymore because this movie is absolutely terrible
It is like this movie reminds me is is stutter almost exactly like the American Pie Band Camp, the American Pie Naked Mile except ten times worse and the fact it's in theaters and not straight to DVD or straight to the trash
Really, if you pay money to go see this movie I don't even know anymore
In the trailer they compare this movie to like, you know, Animal House and American Pie how they were for teen comedies
This movie has absolutely no comedy compared to that, it obviously they're trying to go for young audiences, young adults because they're going to have sexuality in it, of course they do
They're going to have, you know, language, nudity, and drinking, drugs and all that stuff cause it's, you know, college, whatever
This movie is not funny folks, start to end
The story line you don't care about anything
I absolutely hate this movie
I can't even describe
Not only should of it went straight to DVD, if that, it shouldn't have been made, it shouldn't even have been thought of, okay? Really, it is that bad
It is, like, what I can compare it to is a straight to DVD American Pie Presents, that's what it's trying to be
And it is not funny or anything like the American Pie series or Animal House or, you know, Revenge of the Nerds like it do in the trailer
The story line is about these freshmen who, or is about to be freshmen, seniors in high school and they're going to freshman orientation, okay? And they meet up (stutter) you know frat boys and all this and they become friends with them and they meet up with sorority girls and all this and then sexuality flies and then oh they get, you know, in trouble with the frat boys cause, you know, conflicts arise with the girls
It is absolutely terrible
And not only is the story line terrible, the comedy is not funny, get this through your heads
It is not funny, okay? This movie is aimed at young adults who really have nothing better to do with their money
Please go see another movie or do not see this movie at all
Please, please, I am begging you
Do not see this movie
So if you think it's going to be anything what college is like it is no
Just because, you know, there, you know, there's there's (stutter) drinking in college does not mean anything that's something happens in all of them, this is completely so cliche and such one of those college movies that just, you know, exaggerates everything a hundred-million times
Really, it's an exaggeration of everything
So please, don't go to see this movie, it's not funny
Seriously, that's all I got to say
I'm reviewing Shopgirl the DVD
It is a movie made off of Steve Martin's novella that he (stutter) wrote and it is about a girl that is torn between two lovers and she can't really decide between which one, the rich old man or the young man
(umm) Neither of them are really going anywhere
And I would not recommend this movie
It is a rated R movie and it has lots of sex
Not really that much in the language department but it was just a very blah movie and it was supposed to be a romantic comedy but I didn't see that it was funny in any way and it was not a movie that I would recommend for anybody to go see
So if you like Steve Martin even, it's not the Steve Martin that you would think you're getting
It is maybe more of the Steve Martin that is in (umm) that movie I can't think of what it's called, not Grand Canyon but anyway
(umm) About people in LA but I've lost what I'm gonna say
Hey Expo TV
Today I'm here to talk about the movie in theaters, Mirrors (uhh) featuring Kiefer Sutherland
After seeing this one (umm) recently here, I pretty much got what I expected from it
(umm) And what I expected was a poor cliche (umm) horror film with bad acting, bad plot (umm) trying to, you know just trying to scare you and failing miserably
That's exactly what this movie was
(uhh) The premise for this movie is Kiefer Sutherland's character (umm) takes up a job as a night watchmen in a burnt out department store
And there's mirrors in this department store
And (uhh) in the mirrors, naturally he sees horrific images
(umm) You know, demonic images
He see's himself (uhh) like being tortured and stuff like that
(umm) And I don't wanna ruin the pathetic plot of this movie (umm) but obviously he has to confront what's behind these visions in the mirrors and discover why it's happening, how it's happening, how to stop it, why it's happening to him
Actually he needs to enlist some help from his friend Amy
(umm) And it's just kind of your classic (umm) bad horror film
It wasn't really scary, very very predictable (umm) and poor acting
Kiefer Sutherland (umm) does a very bad job in this film with his acting
He's not convincing
The fear he's supposed to be conveying to the audience doesn't seem real
It seems very forced
(umm) It seems like he's expecting what he's seeing (umm) which obviously as the actor he is, but as the character he supposed to be, he's not supposed to expect it so it doesn't really fit
(umm) Combine that with bad language also in the film and this movie just goes downhill
So I'm gonna say one out five stars for The Mirrors
(umm) Don't waste your time with this horror flick (umm) much better ones out there
Hey all, it's the king of movies here, and today I'm going to review The Clone Wars
And this is a new movie (uhh) produced by George Lucas and it's part of the Star Wars series
(uhh) It's, it's (stutter) CGI animated and (umm) this movie's (uhh) basically a different take on the the (stutter) Star Wars (uhh) story
It branches off in a way
And (uhh) I thought this movie was actually pretty disappointing
(umm) It's not too surprising though because the last three (uhh) the three new movies in the Star Wars episodes, episodes one through three were pretty (umm) awful overall
And this (uhh) sticks to that (uhh) same beat as (uhh) the story is, is (stutter) pretty weak
The dialogue is just horrible and it didn't seem like this is a movie that you would expect to see in theaters
It seemed more like a movie you'd, you'd find on like TV, Cartoon Network or something like that, like a (uhh) ninety minute feature length (uhh) straight to TV movie
(uhh) I wouldn't suggest watching this movie unless you're a huge Star Wars fan, and even at that I would (uhh) I would only suggest watching it on TV or DVD or something like that
It's not worth watching in theaters really
Unless you're a big fan of (uhh) the other (stutter) Star Wars related (stutter) early movies
Hi this Matt movie review for Momma Mia this movie is pretty much a movie all about Abba, their songs and starring Meryl Streep and and (stutter) I don't know, I don't know why I thought this movie would be interesting, I didn't realize I didn't see the preview to the movie I heard that it had the songs in there I thought well this will be interesting and I don't like musicals so this was hard for me to watch and one big problem with it is the actors are singing the songs and you know their voice aren't the best (umm) Meryl Streep she does a pretty good job actually she doesn't act very good in this movie, her acting's like so so, and her singing was pretty good, couple of songs pretty good (umm) so you you (stutter) might enjoy this if you like musicals (uhh) I know a lot of people did enjoy this and they really were excited about seeing this and actually wanna see this again for me I wouldn't want to see this again (umm) I didn't really like the movie, and I thought they could've I thought Meryl Streep could been done could been done a lot better at this (umm) Pierce Brosnan is actually in this movie too and he sings horribly when (stutter) he comes up the scenes that he sings, just just (stutter) close your ears run away it's it's bad
Hello everyone
Playing over my shoulder, unfortunately is this movie and this is Star Trek five: The Final Frontier, the two disc special collector's edition
(umm) This this (stutter) movie is is pretty obnoxious I have to say
(uhh) The fourth movie is is (stutter) known for being a very funny movie which I completely agree with
It is a very funny movie
This movie (uhh) tries to be funny
It tries very very hard to be funny and seems as effortful in it's attempts at humor as the previous movie did (uhh) seem effortless (uhh) in in terms of being funny and this movie tries so hard to be funny and just fails at every twist and turn
It is about (umm) a (uhh) a Vulcan who commandeers the Enterprise, cast and crew and all, and (uhh) tries to find God at the end of space and it's (uhh) just as obnoxious as it sounds
It (uhh) was directed by William Shatner and he completely screws it up and it was the first movie he ever directed and they shouldn't have let him direct it because this is a franchise that I really enjoy
The first one is kind of mediocre but the rest of em are all really good, with the exception of this one and (uhh) they followed up my beloved fourth one with this (uhh) steaming pile of garbage
(uhh) The special edition features for this (uhh) steaming pile of garbage (uhh) are as follows
There's a commentary with William Shatner and his daughter, who wrote a book about the process of making this movie
I can't wait to listen to it and listen to him try to defend himself
There is also a text commentary by the co-authors of the Star Trek encyclopedia
(uhh) That's on disc one
Disc two has the Star Trek universe featurettes
(uhh) production featurettes about previsualization models and (uhh) press conference for Star Trek five
There's deleted scenes, although I can't imagine watching, wanting to watch any more of this movie outside of what's contained in the previous thing
(uhh) There's advertising, theatrical trailers and TV spots, which I enjoy watching
I really like watching TV spots and there's a production gallery
(umm) I don't like this movie
I I got it in a in a set with all the other Star Trek movies and (uhh) I figured well you know, they're so inexpensive, I mine as well get this one
Maybe it's not as bad as I thought it was
Maybe it's not as bad as I remember
But it is as bad as I remember it's every inch as bad as I remember
All right, ExpoTV, I'm going to review Death Race
This is a outrageous movie that came out (uhh) in the middle of the August
It's been out for about a little over a month now
(umm) It's about a prisoner who gets framed and he goes to he goes to (stutter) a prison
It's in the future kind of too
And the economy is bad and people don't have good jobs
You find that out in the beginning of the movie
And people don't have good jobs and stuff, so this guy gets framed and goes to jail
And he's, like, a really good race car driver, apparently
But that's not his job, it's just in his history
So he goes to jail and then (uhh) this (uhh) (uhh) lady who runs the jail asks him to do this TV show that's viewed by, like, everyone in the USA
And so he, it's like a death race
That's why the, you just drive around these cars with guns all over them and try and win the race
And if you win all three races, then you're free and you don't have to serve your time anymore in jail
And it's really hard to win
And (umm) she just wants, she just wants him to race in it because (uhh) he's really good at racing
But you'll find out more later in the movie
But, anyway, so, yeah, it's Death Race
(uhh) The actor is John Statham
That's why I saw it, because he's in it
He's a really good actor
He's usually in action movies, like The Transporter and (uhh) a few other, like Crank, some other ones
(umm) Also is Joan Allen
She's the lady who owns the prison and the TV show
And then a bunch of others, like Tyrese Gibson, people like that
He's another race car driver that (uhh) John Statham's character races against and tries to win
And so (stutter) this movie had a pretty good idea
Like, I liked the storyline
(umm) But it was just too much, like, action and too much, like there wasn't, it didn't really even out
Like the acting and stuff, I don't know
The story was pretty good, though, but the overall overall (stutter) movie wasn't that great, probably like three out of five stars
(uhh) I'd recommend seeing it if you like any of the main characters in it
But, other than that, it's really nothing special
You're not going to be blown away by it or anything
(uhh) You can pretty much guess what's going to happen (uhh) halfway through the movie
So it's rated R for strong violence and language
(umm) So definitely want to be, like, at least seventeen to go see it
Definitely not a kids' movie
(umm) It's about a hundred and five minutes long, so about hour and forty-five minutes
Pretty good size movie, average
(umm) So, yeah, Death Race
(umm) Wouldn't recommend seeing it unless you really like the characters and you like action, violence, language movies, stuff like that
This is a movie
It's a DVD, it's called The Secret of Nikola Tesla, T-E-S-L-A, and (uhh) if you don't know who Nikola Tesla is, he's the guy back in the turn of the century he worked with George Westinghouse and (uhh) some other famous guys in developing the (uhh) actually Tesla came up with the idea for the AC motor and the AC generators and motors, some electrical stuff
And (umm) this movie is kind of a story about his life and I'll just read some of this
This (stutters) his achievements, Nikola Tesla, lead to the discovery of the radio and television as well as the development of the first hydroelectric dam, remote control, radar tracking for the military, x-rays and manipulation of matter and energy
So this guy was really smart guy back then and (uhh) and he made a large contribution towards, you know, the electronic age we have today
And (uhh) I was seeing documentaries on Nikola Tesla's life and I much rather see the documentaries than this movie
This movie (uhh) you know, is in the movie format
So it kinda you know, it's like his life from a child you know, to when he's grown up til he's dealing with all these electronic things and other powerful men like J

Morgan
And (umm) this movie I would rate like you know, a two out of five
It's not a good movie because the just the movie was bad
The you know there were some parts in there where, you know, he's talking to his friend in some foreign language and there's no subtitles so it goes on for two or three minutes you don't even know what he's saying
And the picture quality was really bad and just the story
If I didn't know you know the the (stutter) background of Nikola Tesla I would not (umm) I couldn't follow the movie too good
Hello
I'd like to tell you about a movie that a friend took me to see and I didn't really like that much
The movie is called Quarantine and the the (stutter) general plot is it's kind of a, you know, a horror flick
(uhh) People traveling are trapped in a hotel that's been quarantined for an unknown reason and they're slowly getting, you know, picked off one at a time
Now that plot may sound familiar, I know I've seen it in a dozen other movies and frankly (uhh) none of them are that good
There's just not enough to work with there, I mean, sounds like a good place to build up some tension but they really didn't do a job in this movie
It doesn't star anybody that I've ever heard of and I just think it was done very, very poorly
You know, you almost can tell anybody goes outside or comes up with a great idea or something that something bad is going to happen to them immediately, it's pretty obvious, and when it's obvious it's not scary
Hi everybody today I'm reviewing the (uhh) VHS copy of Star Trek: Insurrection
Starring the (uhh) the next generation it has (uhh) (uhh) all all (stutter) the characters which I can't remember the {Laughter} names
But (uhh) it's (uhh) really this is a negative review this is one that I am sad to say I really like star trek, I liked all the spinoffs, star trek, star trek the next generation
And a lot of the movies but Insurrection was a stinker
(uhh) It was horrible I can't recommend it
(uhh) This was given to me I would not have bought it
(uhh) It's it's (stutter) sad to say I mean you know I watched it out of curiosity just to see what was going on and and (stutter) (uhh) it's just just (stutter) a really bad story, that's all there is to it
You know the effects are (uhh) these days there's just nothing that wows you
It's (uhh) nothing unusual but it is not always about effects it's about the storyline and the storyline is just boring
So (uhh) I can't recommend this and I certainly wouldn't buy it
Good morning, I'm Anne Lezak, and I'm chairman of the Rutland County Democrats.
What do I value in a, or look for in a Presidential candidate?
First of all, I would have to vote for a Presidential candidate who has Democratic values.
I just can't see otherwise, because those are so near and dear to me.
And, who espouses those, and is able to articulate them in a way that people can really relate to.
Second of all, I really look for a candidate who I believe is ethical, and who lives his ethics, and doesn't, doesn't compromise.
Hello
I wanna tell you about a movie I just saw in theaters
It's called Punisher: War Zone
This is of course a movie based upon the popular Marvel character The Punisher
Punisher AKA Frank Castle is played by Ray Stevenson and he's up against his classic nemesis, Jigsaw, played by Dominic West
This is actually not that great of a movie
I was kind of disappointed
Most of the Marvel movies have been pretty good in recent years and most of the comic book movies in general have been fairly well done
This one's kind of weak, this is the third time they've made a Punisher movie and second one in recent years
It seems it's always getting a new cast and a new direction and it's just not working for me
The Punisher himself is kind of an avenging (uhh) angel, kind of in the grey area
Is he a good guy or bad guy? He goes out and punches those who have done wrong, basically by hunting them down and killing them
And (uhh) just like in the comic books (uhh) when he's good he's really good
When he's (uhh) bad it's unreadable
Well (uhh) when he's bad in the movies he's unwatchable
It's just a little too silly
It's a very very violent movie but the violence is kind of poorly done
I mean, violence in and of itself is (uhh) okay, I reckon, if it's done correctly
But this kind of weak (uhh) I mean it's over the top violence
It's more ridiculous than it is (uhh) gritty and (uhh) I just didn't think they were able to pull this movie together
Hello
I want to talk to you about a movie I recently saw
It's called Twilight
Actually, (uhh) this is not your typical review
It's almost a warning
Do not let your girlfriend drag you to see Twilight
This movie is aimed at young girls
And (uhh) for some reason some of the older girls seem like to like it as well
But basically this is a movie for young, teenage girls and there's nothing there
There's not much of a plot
It's kind of run of the mill plot of a, a (stutter) young girl who gets sent away from her parents to back to, to her, her (stutter) father who, who lives in a different town
She goes to a new school and she's not fitting in
She sees a dreamy young boy and oh yeah, he happens to be a vampire
But he's not a bad vampire, he's a good vampire
He doesn't even drink people blood anymore
(uhh) except for some reason he's so infatuated with her he wants to drink her blood
And she's so infatuated with him that (uhh) she might just let him, and that's basically the tension for the whole movie
(uhh) will he? Won't he? Will she let him? (ehh) whatever
Drink blood, it's just kind of stupid
I guess it's supposed to be some sort of romantic tension there and all the young girls in the audience went crazy for it, and I guess they thought the guy was dreamy or hot, or whatever they think nowadays
But, to me, I just wanted to go to sleep
It's not a good movie
There's nothing there
And (uhh) frankly, vampires aren't supposed to be this mushy romantic characters
And if you really want to go that route, go watch Dark Shadows reruns somewhere on TV, they have to be out there somewhere
They're a lot better
So, (uhh) see something else
See a real movie
See a real man movie, something with explosions or something
Hi, you're watching my video review of Role Models
This is a comedy that's rated R
There's a lot of cursing and crudeness but unfortunately it's not a funny movie
The humor in the movie feels really forced, like they're trying too hard and the writing's not very good
The movie is pretty formulaic, you know how the movies gonna end and I guess you could say that about a lot of movies in Hollywood but at least try to be funny along the way but this movie doesn't really deliver that
The character played by Sean William Scott is pretty annoying
Sean William Scott is Stifler in every movie that he's in, and that might've been funny back when he made American Pie like ten years ago or however long it was but, when you play the same character in every movie it starts to wear thin and just wasn't that funny
So, I would recommend looking somewhere else and not watching Role Models
Hey expo
What's up? (umm) Today I'm going to talk about a movie I saw called Valkyrie, starring Tom Cruise
(umm) Valkyrie was a bad movie
First of all Valkyrie is about a plot to assassinate Hitler before all hell breaks loose in Germany
Now most of us are pretty familiar with the history of World War Two but we know that Hitler killed himself so this is the first movie I ever went into knowing the ending
Now some people would say that that's important but it is when they're trying to create suspense around it
Another thing that I didn't like about it was the fact that it starred Tom Cruise
Not just cause he's a nutjob, but because he really did not convince me
It wasn't a German soldier trying to overthrow Hitler, it was Tom Cruise pretending to be an (stutter), pretending to be a German soldier overthrowing Hitler and we saw through that
He didn't even try, he didn't even attempt a German accent
He can do an Irish accent in Far and Away, I don't understand why he couldn't do a German accent in this
Also I went into this movie expecting at least a little bit of action considering the fact that it, it's (stutter) surrounded by a war and, you know, violence
However there was none whatsoever
There was maybe three gunshots in the entire thing and I think they all missed
Maybe one hit
And that was it, it was over
They caught him, the end
Sorry if I ruined it for you but you really shouldn't be seeing it anyway
So don't waste your time, go see something better
I went to the movies (uhh) with the people that I work with, and we saw the movie The Unborn
I kind of wondered about this movie when I saw the previews
It was one of those ones that was gonna go one way or the other
It was either gonna be really good or it was gonna be really bad
Unfortunately, it was really bad
It was one of the worst movies ever
The story line was completely stupid
It it (stutter) wasn't a good horror movie
It wasn't spooky
It wasn't scary
There was no part of the movie that made you jump
There were no you know, got you minutes or anything like that
I mean it was just dumb
(umm) I didn't like the movie
I wouldn't recommend it
If I saw it on TV I would change the channel
(umm) I would, I would (stutter) tell everybody not to waste their money going to see it
If you're a die hard horror picture movie person, you probably still won't like it
But if you still want to see it, wait for it to come on DVD
Don't waste your money in the theater
Hi, today I'm reviewing the movie Gran Torino, starring Clint Eastwood and directed by Clint Eastwood
(umm) The movie is about a Korean war veteran, played by Eastwood, who lives in (umm) a Detroit suburb suburb (stutter) and (umm) is trying to cope with the changing of his neighborhood as several (uhh) Hmong (uhh) immigrants start to relocate into the town
(umm) He is a very crotchety old man and he starts the film at his wife's funeral with his disrespectful family who he's pretty much always disappointed with
(umm) And he slowly comes to terms with the changing neighborhood around him and befriends the (umm) Hmong neighbors next door
(umm) Overall, this movie was not as great as I'd expected from (umm) Eastwood
Both in the director's chair and as an actor
(umm) I was kinda disappointed with it
I thought the dialogue was silly at times and it was (umm) very melodramatic film
(umm) Which was unfortunate cause I really wanted to go in to watch a great Eastwood film
(umm) As an actor he plays jut kind of a crotchety old man, but he does turn into (umm) the (uhh) kind of the Clint Eastwood we all know and love
The (uhh) gun toting, don't take anything from anybody Clint Eastwood who (umm) just kind of uses violence to get his way
(umm) And he deals with the repercussions of that and (uhh) his own personal feeling toward the immigrants in his town
(umm) The character development was okay
(umm) I really enjoyed seeing Clint Eastwood as this character
He was funny and very (uhh) gruff and (umm) hard to love, which makes him likable
But overall, I really I was very disappointed with the film
(umm) Eastwood was great in the movie
(umm) But it was kind of a one dimensional character, even though he does kind of go through character transition that you would expect him to go through
(umm) And it is kind of (umm) typical kind of (umm) an ending that you would see coming if you were paying attention to the movie and (umm) kinda predictable
But I did like his performance
I would, overall I would have to give the movie only two out of five stars
(umm) Like I said, I was disappointed with it overall
But (umm) It's well worth it just to see Clint Eastwood turning into an old man and using a gun to get those darn kids off his lawn
(umm) So if you are fan of Eastwood maybe check it out just to see him in what could be his last (uhh) acting role, or starring acting role anyway
Hey everyone on ExpoTV dot com
Now today I'm going to be reviewing a movie in theaters called Fired Up
Now I forget who this is starring but I'll give you a little summary of what the movie's about
It's about these two guys who are tired of summer football camps and decide to scheme and go to a cheerleading camp and obviously they're surrounded by all these young women and this guy, like they start falling for them and a bunch of stuff happens
Now overall it wasn't really that funny
There was nothing really funny about it
They tried to use like sexual humor to get you to laugh but it didn't work
(umm) It had a lot, here let's see, it's actually I'm not even gonna see
But (uhh) it's just overall another one of these stupid movies
(uhh) it's nothing special, nothing worth seeing
The plot is basically like I said, the summary sums it up, so if that sounds interesting go watch it, I don't know
But obviously, I mean honestly I think that it was a terrible movie
It just left me, I left the theaters just completely yawning and bored and I don't know why I just spent my money so please do not waste your money watching this movie
Hey y'all, how's it going? My name is Jordan and (uhh) today I'm going to be reviewing the DVD Spy Game
Now this had Brad Pitt in it, the movie itself had Brad Pitt in it, and Robert Redford and (umm) when I watched this movie I thought it was boring
(umm) I, when I went into it I was thinking it was going to be, you know, this big action movie
I mean on the front it has this explosion and, you know, it has all this helicopter and the men moving and everything
But really it's not that action packed at all
It's (uhh) more of a drama kind of movie, and I didn't really get into it at all because I was expecting it to be this huge elaborate, you know, action movie where, you know, stuff blew up and people were shooting and stuff like that, but that that (stutter) wasn't this at all
(umm) It was really more of a psychological drama kind of movie
It really didn't have that much action
So (umm) I don't think I'd really recommend this movie, it's not really that great
So the movie's not that good so I guess y'all should probably stay away from it
(umm) Special features wise there's a good bit of special features but I just didn't care to see them because I didn't like the movie, so I didn't really care about the special features also, but (umm) in the in the (stutter) special features they have (uhh) a documentary on how they created some of the (uhh) some of the limited action scenes that they did
You know, there's only a few, but the ones that they did they explained them
But (umm) other than that I think there's a commentary and theatrical trailer but that's about it
So (umm) really I wouldn't recommend this one, I don't, I don't think this was a really good movie so it's really not worth purchasing
If you must see it though definitely go rent it first
But (umm) but yeah that that's (stutter) about it
Hi Expo, today I wanna do a movie review for you of a movie currently in theaters and that is Confessions of a Shopaholic
And I have my ticket stub here for Confessions of a Shopaholic
Confessions of a Shopaholic is (umm) based on a series of novels (stutter) by Sophie Consella
(umm) And it is about a girl named Becky Bloomwood who is obsessed with shopping
This particular film (umm) I've read the novels and they're really good I guess you could say chick lit
(umm) Very fluffy, very entertaining, but this movie was absolutely awful
(umm) Which, I think you can kind of tell from the previews it's gonna be not so funny
(umm) In the novels Becky Bloomwood is, you know, I think that her character is a little bit smarter but in this movie she comes off as very dumb
And the message at the end of the movie isn't very good
(umm) I don't think
And it's just over the top and the character of Becky is just not very strong and the acting I also thought was not very good (umm) (umm) for that character
I would definitely recommend that if you've read the shopaholic books to absolutely not go see this movie, and if you haven't read the shopaholic books too absolutely not go see this movie cuz it's it's it's (stutter) really awful
I (umm) it doesn't have a good message, no good characters, the characters are portrayed as dumb (umm) and over the top, so don't go see it
Hi everyone, today I'm doing my (stutter) review on this movie called The International
(umm) Clive Owens is in it and to be honest with you I don't remember it very much
I watched it about a week ago in theaters and it was so boring
It's supposed to be kind of this like thriller drama, but half the time I didn't know what was going on
(umm) He basically is a detective or works for the law and is looking for this person and these people that are in charge of a bank that (umm) supposedly trying to kill people and murder people and get away with it
(umm) That's the main plot line
But he his (stutter) character didn't seem very strong
The supporting characters didn't seem very strong
The story line was kind of boring
So I would not recommend this to anybody to go in theaters and watch
I probably wouldn't (stutter) recommend it renting it either when it comes out on DVD
Hey, everyone on ExpoTV dot com
Now, today I'm going to be reviewing another movies in theaters called The Haunting in Connecticut
Now (umm) this is sort of, if you've ever seen the movie Poltergeist, then (uhh) this movie is pretty similar to that
It's basically this kid is being treated for cancer, so they relocate their house
And the house that (uhh) they move into has a dark history behind it basically
And, you know, all this weird stuff goes on
And then they basically try to get help from a ghost hunter to drive, like, the evil spirits out of their house
(umm) Anyway, I didn't really find this movie (uhh) that good
It had some creepy moments, but I was expecting a lot more from the trailer
You see a lot more and it kind of freaks you out and wants you to go see it
But, you know, nothing really special
I didn't really catch onto anything
It was a pretty plain movie anyway {yawn} but, you know, maybe maybe (stutter) (uhh) there will be other ones that come out
But this is not a good horror movie, I don't think, at least
I might be wrong
You can go check at, check it out and maybe prove me wrong
I don't really know
I can't really think of anything that was that good about it
It was okay
I mean, it was entertaining to watch, but nothing really had you thinking it really, nothing special
Hey there expo
So regrettably yesterday I went to go see Next Day Air
(umm) One of my poorer choices, to say the least
(umm) But it was a rainy afternoon, didn't really anything to do so headed out for a matinee
Figured, you know, lower price, can't lose too bad, right? (umm) Well I went to go see Next Day Air cause (umm) I'd already seen Star Trek and I heard awful things about Wolverine
So (umm) yeah
This was (stutter) supposed to be a comedy
(uhh) It wasn't that funny
I mean there was some funny parts, (umm) I'll I'll (stutter) give it that
But overall it wasn't fun to watch, (stutter) the acting was subpar to say the least
(umm) It did have (uhh) Turk from Scrubs fame (umm) and Avon Barksdale from The Wire so some actors that I was familiar with
(umm) But they did not really deliver the package, so to speak, (umm) in this, in this (stutter) film
Brief synopsis (umm) a cocaine shipment from Mexico gets delivered to the wrong apartment in Philadelphia and chaos and hilarity ensue, or at least they're supposed to
(uhh) Chaos definitely happened
Hilarious (uhh) not so much
It had its funny moments but overall I would definitely not watch it again and if I had the choice I would go back and not see it
(uhh) So that's, yeah Next Day Air
It's in theaters now
Hey, how you doing? My name is Roger
Went and saw Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince (umm) the other night
And I will tell you I am not (umm) one of those Harry Potter fans
Have not read the books
(uhh) Have seen the other movies, but I've seen the movies because I went with my daughters, or (umm) who who (stutter) were had gotten into the books, and read the books and really (umm) you know, were a fan of Harry Potter
(umm) So (umm) my my (stutter) review is based off of someone who is not a true Harry Potter fanatic
Okay, but went to go see a movie with a daughter that enjoyed it (umm) that it was a fanatic
But, so I want to give you my perspective from the other side of it
(umm) I did not read the books
(umm) I have seen all the movies, I did state that
(umm) What I found with this movie, one it was two hours and thirty minutes long, which was a tad bit long for me
(umm) Because most of the, most of the (stutter) time in the first thirty minutes, I was trying to figure out who these people were
How they related to each other, and they did talk about things that happened in prior movies, and I vaguely remember
And if I had read the book, obviously I would know the whole story up to this point in time
Because what I'm, whatever number this movie is, it is a, it is the next segment in the (umm) in the series of of (stutter) movies
So I did understand that you, you can't just walk in and say, and expect to catch up with everything
It doesn't start from the beginning
It's, picks up pretty much, I guess where it left off of the other one
So this (uhh) (uhh) was a (uhh) little bit of a hindrance for me, because like you said for thirty minutes I was trying to remember who was that person
How did they relate? Who was that for? Were they a good guy or a bad guy? (umm) They looked familiar, those type of things
So I had a little bit, you know, trouble catching up with that
The movie itself was fun, it was enjoyable
It was action packed
It moved along very well
(umm) Again, it was just the thinking behind it, the story behind it, I didn't carry it as well as I needed to
So maybe I should have watched the other Harry Potter movies before I went
(umm) I definitely, if you ever get into it
Read the book, cause the book will definitely tell you what you need to know
I just however was not going to read that book before I watched the movie
So you know, it was enjoy, more enjoyable for my family who've read the books
(umm) It was not, wasn't (stutter) quite as enjoyable for me
So, it's just okay
(umm) I probably would not go see it again because, again, I I (stutter) until I have some background information, it just really wouldn't work for me that way
Okay, that was Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince
Hi there, I'm Alexis and I'm doing a review on My Sister's Keeper
This movie is playing out in theaters and it is very good
I would give it a five star rating
And (umm) basically the movie is PG-thirteen it's one hour and forty-six minutes
(umm) There are very good actresses and actors in this movie
And I was very impressed with the film
(uhh) There's Abigail Breslin, Cameron Diaz, Sofia Vassilieva and Jason Patrick
And they all play very, very good
(umm) I was just really impressed with this movie and I recommend it to many people
One thing that I should warn you about is the movie will probably make you cry throughout the whole film
Because it's about this little girl who is dying from leukemia and there are just (umm) the family, it (umm) is just getting torn apart
And there's just a lot of the drama going on and (umm) it's a wonderful storyline, really really interesting and (umm) it will just keep you on the edge of your seat the whole movie
It's very, very good and I am so impressed with how it turned out
There's also a bestselling book called My Sister's Keeper and that's why they have the movie and (umm) it's just so good, so
Go watch it, I mean I just want everyone to see it because it's just so serious you can see how (umm) you can watch a girl, a little kid going through leukemia and it's just so sad but
I mean, it just shows you right there and
I mean that stuff really gets to you and it was pretty serious, so (umm) I think that many people should see it so that you can see how serious leukemia is and how much it affects the family
And all that, so yeah
It just, it opened my eyes to life and like opened my eyes to a different view on life and I know that it would open many views to other peoples and people
Hi, so you're a home owner and you're wondering how to calculate HELOC or home equity line of credit or a second mortgage.
No problem, I'll be able to answer that for you.
My name is Rebecca Wilson and I'm the Chief Curator at Saatchi Art and the Director of our Art Advisory service.
I'm really excited to be able to introduce you to our Invest in Art series, a series that we put together to give people help and guidance about investing in emerging art.
When people ask me for my advice about which works they should buy and how they should go about investing in emerging art, I'm always reminded of the wonderful story of Herbert and Dorothy Vogel, an American couple who lived in a small apartment in New York and didn't have much money but shared a passion for art.
In the 1960s, they started buying works by emerging artists, artists who weren't known but actually went on to become some of the giants of the modern art scene.
Names such as Donald Judd, Roy Lichtenstein, and Chuck Close.
Over 30 years, they amassed an extraordinary collection of over 4,000 works, which they donated in the 1990s to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.
This fantastic story reminds us that you don't actually have to have big budgets in order to start a collection, and buying works by emerging artists is a great way to begin.
So I hope you will look at the works that I've selected by emerging artists for our ongoing Invest in Art series.
These are works by very, very talented artists from around the world whose works have the potential to rise in value.
If you've like any additional help and guidance from me and my team of curators, I'd be very, very happy to to help you.
They're much more excited about I've got it, I've learned it, and let me let you know that I've got it

They love to problem solve
And that's what we're doing in the classroom
Between everyone in the discussions and the different debates, we're problem solving

I had one student tell me that he came in-- he came in to see me in office hours
And he said to me, you know, it took me three weeks to figure out what you wanted from me
That went quite well.
I organized it.
I did all the land selections.
We were entitled a hundred and thirty thousand acres.
Being in a area where there is quite a bit of activity.
And military state, other private individuals claiming land where we had...we had the right to invade up to 50 percent of state selections.
Of course that was half a hundred...three townships.
So that wasn't too difficult.

And one of the questions that I've heard often is.
What is a motivational speaker?
And I think, I think in my case a motivational speaker is someone who sort of combines giving knowledge to the people that I'm speaking to.
I definitely would say mobile is the up and coming sort of thing.
Insights are critical.
That’s where it all starts.

Being a film major at Montana State University, I'm used to carrying around heavy video production equipment.
But one day, my back just didn't feel right.
So I stopped in at the Bozeman Back and Neck Clinic.
Everyone at the clinic is top notch.
I work freelance for the local alternative weekly, and what that means is sometimes they'll give me assignments; sometimes I'll choose my own projects to work on, and then submit them to the, to the weekly for publication.
There are lots of of avenues for photojournalists these days.
Hi my name is Pat Goodwin with patgoodwinassociates.com and today we are going to talk about how to write summaries for resumes.
The summary is a direct reflection of what you have done in the work itself but also who you are as a person.
I have said so many times that people want to know what you've done, when you've done it and where but when they meet you they want to know how you think and the summary is a perfect opportunity to demonstrate that.
Of course there are some basic principles that you would do in following a resume with a summary.
You would have your name at the top, centered, all caps in bold about ten or eleven point then you would have your contact information.
Hopefully you would have an e-mail that is not a strange looking e-mail.
Today's question comes from Linda in Florida and it's on Personal Branding.
I posted on Facebook a while back and said if you have any questions on marketing your businesses as a speaker ask away and her question was what if I have to develop 3 separate brand identities?
And while it's not impossible but it's not advised you know too many speakers today are getting in the business because they've seen speakers from yesteryear and what they do and what they're doing is they're looking at them and modeling their business models.
There's a problem with that.
the most famous speakers of today are using a business model that's about forty years old and while it works great for them when they're already an established brand the new speakers of tomorrow don't have the luxury to be like generalists and solve everybody's problems all the time.
Well, with mobile, location becomes so much more important.
It’s not just, you know, where you happen to be logging in from on your PC, it’s like-- you know, increasingly where you are with-- you know, within several meters, especially as a lot of these location based services start to gain scale.
I've lost track of the number of hours I've spent writing and rewriting the same speech.
If it weren't for the seemingly infinite number of documents I can create in Microsoft Word, my indecisiveness probably would have killed at least one tree's worth of paper.
If I could reliably see the future, this would be easier.
I could know whether this bit of personal information would advance my argument or kill my credibility forever.
Instead, I can only imagine, only daydream best and worst case scenarios, although "day-nightmare" might be a better term for the ways this could go wrong.
In an ideal world with common sense, my story would be listened to, would boost my argument.
But if this was an ideal world with common sense, I wouldn't need to be writing this speech in the first place.
I haven't discussed my story with my speech's audience, but I have read internet comment sections of stories like my own, and those places get nasty.
I know anonymous comments can bring out the worst in people, and since my speech is in person nobody can hide behind a user name, but I'm still apprehensive as ever.
Hi this is Rhett Reiger for White Caspian Studios on behalf of Expert Village.
There's a few things that go along with being an Independent film.
Number one, there's excitement, because you're doing something independent normally on your own time and sometimes your own money.
So there's a lot of freedom, but with that freedom comes an enormous amount of responsibility.
Alright, now let's talk about organization.
The first thing we want to talk about when we talk about organization is the introduction, which is one of the most important parts of the speech.
The first thing we have to take a look at is did the first line out of the speakers mouth -which is the attention getter, or should be- did it get our attention?
Secrets to a successful visitor visa application.
A lot of people who are applying for a Canadian visitor visa are nervous whether or not they will succeed.
Will they get a visa?
Will they get refused?
After all, applying for a visitor visa can be nerve wrecking.
Hello everyone, my name is Hishge Bessey of visaplace.com.
When an immigration officer is processing visa application, all of them actually have one big question in their mind, "Will this applicant go back to their home country after they've finished their visit to Canada?" This will be our main concern especially if the applicant is from a developing or underdeveloped countries because many of the visitors from those countries don't go back.
So how do you convince the officer that you are a true visitor who will play by the rules?
There are several factors that may help you to succeed.
The first factor will be to show you have a strong establishment in your country.
This includes your employment stability, any school attendance if that's applicable to you, and assets you own, and marital status, children and family, and any other responsibilities that require your return to your home country.
Payday loans have become a scourge across Britain attacking our high streets and giving people the idea that this very niche form of lending, that's unsuitable for most people   is perfectly normal.
Worse still we see it even on our children's television channels.
It's a form of  financial grooming in luring the next generation to this type of debt, making them think it's normal, it's perfectly normal to borrow at extremely high rates for short terms with terrible terms if you can't repay.
That's why what you're doing, in encouraging credit unions, nonprofit local organizations still with the same protection &amp; backing from the regulator the Financial Services Compensation Scheme protection just as legitimate.
Encouraging them take on the payday lenders to show that if you really need money ('cos if you don't need it, why are you borrowing it?) If you really need money, then there is another alternative.
and what we have to do in every way that we possibly can is think about getting that message out to a wider society so I love the idea of the contest.
How do you promote credit unions?
What does it mean to you?
Do you know whether your business is required to have a corporate seal and official stock certificates? These items were once required items for corporations
Now, even though they are no longer required, they can still be extremely useful
Most states still recognize the legal power of a corporate seal and official stock certificates
The corporate seal, like a state seal, was once the official mark of a corporation
Corporate Seals are official identifying marks that are imprinted into clay, wax, metal or paper
Today’s more modern Corporate Seals emboss the corporation’s official name, state and year of its formation onto legal documents which represent the power and authority to authenticate them
As a corporation is considered a separate entity, its own person, and the seal acted as its signature
This was because an individual could not authorize certain corporate acts, and the corporate seal proved corporate authority
In the digital age, though, technology has made the corporate seal obsolete
You might sometimes still see a corporate seal used for deeds or bank accounts, but even these are rare
Today, state laws recognize the signature of an individual with corporate authority, such as the CEO or director, as binding upon the corporation
Originally, official stock certificates served as title to a corporation’s stock and were issued to all stock holders
These certificates showed proof of ownership of corporate shares
One of the key trends that we are continuing to see as important and where we're directing some of our money is in just the general online marketing area.
When the game was first designed there was another mechanic which is no longer used.
For an interesting reason, there's a zone called the anti zone which is where your cards go when you risk them, when you risk the ownership of them on a game.
The rules for anti had to be discontinued and disallowed because it turned out that they were against the law according to the gambling statutes.
For Magic to remain legal the anti cards had to be removed from the game.
Do you own a restaurant, B&amp;B, hair salon, or any other LOCAL business?
Then you need to start collecting reviews!
A recent survey shows that 88% of consumers read online reviews to determine the quality of a local business.
When you also factor in the popularity of online directories like Yelp, you will quickly realize how important it is to start collecting online reviews.
But how can you generate reviews and increase positive feedback about your business without making your clients feel uncomfortable or pushed into a corner?
Here are three steps to get you started.
The first and most obvious one is: Provide excellent service.
Easier said than done and yet, too often forgotten.
While most clients will not take the time to write a review about a mediocre experience, they WILL share details of an extremely bad experience, or an outstanding one.
Try to provide one of those outstanding experiences that will motivate your clients to write a review.
The second step is to create a personalized profile for your business on major online directories and social networks.
Make sure to claim ownership on all of your business’s listings and let your customers know to check them out.
Once you’ve created your profiles, you are ready for Step #3. Make it easy for your clients to leave you feedback.
To do this, create links from your website to your listings’ sites.
You can also put up signs in your business or on your menu.
Just a recap Show an example where you demonstrated this strength
Although there is no universal, one-size-fits-all answer for this question, you’ll feel more confident if you can create a structured response
The best way to prepare is to list a few strengths that correspond to the job you want
Then, imagine a story that illustrates how you demonstrated that strength in the past
And most importantly, keep your sentences simple
to help us create more out of classroom conversations for that and engage in community dialogue
because what I know for sure If anybody can help heal the community, it would be a community college
We are a place where all of these things have happened before
Every time someone new has come into our community, we've been there to help respond
Anytime is been an economic struggle in our community come we have been part responsive
Anybody is gonna do it is gonna be us
But we have to have courage, we have to have civility, and we have to be willing to be vulnerable on this so realize that we are different perspectives and create space for all that to happen
Hi, this is Michael Niren, immigration lawyer and founder of VisaPlace.com.
The Cake Boss, Buddy Valastro, has allegedly been charged with a DUI.
Now why this is interesting from an immigration perspective, is that if he's in fact convicted, he may be prevented from entering Canada.
Not to say that he wants to come to Canada, but if he ever does, he would have a criminal record, and the Canadian authorities, the border authorities, the CBSA they're called, Canadian Border Service Agency, officers could potentially deny him from entering Canada, and he may have to apply for a special permit called the temporary resident permit, or TRP, to be admitted.
So the consequences of being convicted of an offense are not just that you would have a criminal record in your own country, but if you want to cross borders and come to Canada, you may be prevented from doing so.
Hi
My Roger and I want to tell you about a movie called Body Double
Now this is a Brian De Palma movie that came out back in nineteen eighty four and I will tell you back in the eighties when I first saw this movie, I thought it was a pretty good movie
(umm) It had it as a mystery, intrigue, (umm) you know, very, very, kind of (uhh) (stutter) drama type (uhh) you know investigative type movie and (umm) you know and back then I really enjoyed it
I thought it was a good movie about a guy who was house sitting and actually seeing somebody get murdered and all of the sudden she's there
So they try to figure out how this happened
(umm) But you know, getting this movie a couple years ago because I saw it on the shelf and looked at it and I said, you know, it's kind of, it's it's (stutter) just not up to par with today's type of movies
(umm) There's a little bit hocky (umm) looking at it now the special effects were were (stutter) terrible, I mean they weren't that good at all and the story wasn't as deep as I thought it originally was
So, you know, I'll take it, if you, if you (stutter) want to go back down through memory lane to see movies that were done back in the eighties, this is obviously an eighties type movie
(umm) It's not up to par with anything on today's standards and I'll tell you, I saw it again and I just I just (stutter) didn't enjoy it like I would of some of movies that, you know, that some of the other older movies so, but anyways it's called Body Double, it's rated R because its got some sexual scenes in it and some cussing in it things like this language (umm) and and (stutter) some nudity, you know and, and back in the eighties, I guess, you know when you look at the, the (stutter) (uhh) {laughter} the selection you had, this was a pretty good movie but in today's today's (stutter) standards, today's world, it really was a kinda a hocky eighties movie so I don't really recommend you go and get it or go and watch it again, there's probably some other movies that you probably rather watch instead of that
But anyways, it's called Body Double and (umm) it's got it's a Brian De Palma movie
Ok
Hi
My name's Jennifer and today I'm going to talk to you about How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days
Now this movie stars Kate Hudson and Mathew McConaughey and it is made by Paramount Pictures
It is an absolutely brilliant movie
This is my favorite romantic comedy of all time
I love Kate Hudson, Mathew McConaughey together
There's sparks flying in this movie, they're just so good together
(umm) You can really see the interaction between them
And basically Kate works for a magazine and she writes a column how to something in ten days
So what she chose to do was how to lose a guy in ten days and Mathew McConaughey wants to get a contract (umm) for the diamond market and to do so he has to make a woman fall in love with him in ten days
So the two just happen to meet and (umm) they're paired up together and she's trying to drive him away and he's trying to woo her over
So it's just a battle of who can win
Can she lose him or can he make her fall in love with him? It's just very funny the way Kate Hudson just dominates (umm) being the woman of the relationship
At first she's just so great and then she does everything she knows guys hate
It's so great, cause everyone knows the classic cliches
(umm) Calling twenty times a day or talking baby talk or just putting stuffed animals all over his apartment
Things like that, and she's so great
I'm going to be reviewing the movie Hamburger Hill
This movie's about a (uhh) unit of American soldiers during the Vietnam war who have to defend this actually, no they have to attack this hill and (uhh) try to remove the (uhh) North Vietnamese from there
It's (uhh) it's a pretty sad movie, since (uhh) some people who you weren't expecting to die do in fact die
The (uhh) only thing about this movie is there's (uhh) some better Vietnam movies out there and with better casts
This cast is (uhh) the most notable person on here is probably Don Cheadle or that guy from practice, I don't remember his name
Hey guys Peter Leeds here.
People have been asking me what tactics I use when trading stocks so ill give them to you now but keep in mind this is not trading advice its just simply what I do and if you wanna learn more swing over to the blog at peterleeds.com we have more details there.
I cut my loses early, I let my gains run.
I always observe position sizing, I don't average down but I average up.
Its also very important what I try to observe is that you make your money when you buy the stock not when you sell the stock.
Its so much more important to get it at a good buy price than it is to get a good sell price.
I completely ignore previous prices.
Many investors will look at a stock and say its down half of the value it used to be at or its at a fraction of the value and they wrongly believe that that means that's a good investment or its cheap.
The way it works is that the shares are gonna act the way they are gonna act based on the things hat happen in the future not what happened in the past, a stock has no memory.
So this is a movie review on Inception starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt
(umm) I wasn't very excited going in to see this movie
(umm) It was my friend's choice to go see this movie
I hadn't even seen the previews for it
But I wasn't going to complain
And I just, I'm very glad that this is what my friends chose to see
It was such an amazing movie
My mind was like completely blown with the, with the movie, with the twists, with everything
(umm) I'm not really the biggest Leonardo DiCaprio fan but he did an amazing job and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is just an extremely (uhh) flexible actor, he's very versatile, he can play a lot of different roles
(umm) Seeing him in Five Hundred Days of Summer didn't make me believe that he was going to do a good job on such serious role as this one, but I was definitely proven wrong
(umm) The ending, oh the ending is just, it's crazy
It leaves you on the edge of your seat and kind of angers you too
This movie gets you so, it makes you think, you know
(umm) Inception (umm) is explained in the movie to be going into somebody's dream and planting an idea in their mind that grows with them
And it just like changes who they are and how they feel about life and things
(umm) Like I said, it was an amazing movie, (uhh) definitely a five out of five
Actually it was more like a ten out of five
It was so good that it's, it's (stutter) a movie you have to see
organizations like our voice, and basically just informing Greek gentleman of making good decisions with the influence of alcohol and making sure that we clearly define consent and that we basically hold each other accountable and don't make bad decisions
So our campus culture revolves a lot around education
If you walk through our, our student union━you walk through the quad, anything
Hey guys
I'm going to do the movie called Norbit
(umm) I had a chance to huh catch this movie on a prerelease screening (umm) last week
Thank goodness I did not pay for the movie
It (uhh) stars Eddie Murphy
He plays several characters in the movie
(umm) He plays the main character and he plays (umm) a big a big obese woman in the character as well and you know, it's about him trying to win his true love, trying to impress this woman
Which is not that obese (stutter) obese woman in the movie that he also plays but that's another another actress who portrays his true love in the movie
I mean after watching (umm) The nutty Professor or Doctor Dolittle (umm) those (stutter) movie were tolerable, but this movie was was (stutter) just out of the park
When I was watching this movie throughout throughout (stutter) in a in a (stutter) movie in the theater, I was just going what the heck am I doing here? (umm) I mean, the only thing I was impressed with the movie movie (stutter) was (umm) the fact that he he (stutter) played several different characters (umm) at the same time in the movie
(uhh) That was the only thing that I was (uhh) (uhh) you know impressed with
Other than that the acting was (uhh) really really less than mediocre and the story line is so cliche and you know, so over done
I mean what happened to Eddie Murphy's (umm) career? I mean this is how low he's gonna go? How low can he sink any further? I hope he will get better roles (umm) than this movie
(umm) This movie I mean, if you don't have to pay for the the (stutter) movie ticket for this (uhh) Norbit, I recommend it
(umm) If not, don't catch it at all
This is a review for the movie AntiTrust
(umm) The main actors in it are Ryan Phillippe, Rachael Leigh Cook, Claire Foriani, Forlani and Tim Robbins
(umm) If I was a professional reviewer and I had to give this movie (uhh) you know a star rating, it would probably be like two out of five
(uhh) That being said it's still sort of a fun, (uhh) enjoyable movie to watch if you're not terribly concerned with, you know, genius level filmmaking
(umm) It's just, (uhh) sort of a fun movie
It kind of takes place where the main character's sort of, invited to work for (uhh) a Microsoft-like company, and (uhh) things are all sort of going on (uhh) in the company and he discovers it all, and it's sort of like, what happens from there
(umm) You know (stutter) it's a, it's a (stutter) solid movie
It's rated PG thirteen, (uhh) so pretty much anyone can watch it
(umm) It's only about, just slightly under two hours long
I think about an hour and forty-eight minutes
(uhh) But, you know, it's a solid movie that's sort of fun
I wouldn't try to impress anyone with it
&gt;&gt; Hi, good evening, this is Ambuj Chaturvedi.
To answer the question whether India can become a superpower or not, the obvious answer is yes, because eventually we will arrive at that spot.
We -- the transformation process is starting, has begun since '91, so India is not looking back.
Now the second part of the question would be what does it take to be a superpower and when can become a superpower?
So what is the definition of a superpower?
Nuclear weapons, good roads, good railways, good infrastructure, good power, good power facilities, zero power cuts, women's education, equal rights.
India will arrive at all those -- India will arrive at all those avenues, all those milestones will be achieved.
As many times only a small amount of people actually possesses this knowledge, sharing it will hold a large advantage for your company
This will result in greater cooperation among your employees, a better working environment and reduce time to complete tasks and activities
And are there any more advantages
Yes, Victor, there are many
Knowledge markets will allow you to resolve problems by using the knowledge of your staff
Furthermore you will depend less on external sources of knowledge
Also employees will realize that they are working or looking for information on the same topics
This may lead to the creation communities, which is a great tool for the facilitation of exchange of knowledge within groups
You convinced me Paula, but how can I organize such a knowledge market
The movie I will be reviewing for you right now is Final Cut starring Robin Williams
The idea of this film is very very interesting
The whole main tag of this is basically in the end, he sees everything
See, in the near future, they have people that run a machine called the guillotine
What it does is that after you die, it takes all of your memories that were downloaded on a chip that was implanted in your brain
And what it does is it allows them to make little snippets for your funeral
Little (uhh) home movies if you will
Just a reel of movies to show at your funeral
Now, this man sees atrocities
All sources of evil off people throughout his adventures of, well not really adventures but throughout his career of going through everyone's memories and editing them for their family's consumption at the funeral
Now as I said, that's a very good premise
That probably have you captured right now like I wanna see Final Cut right now
It is a good idea, it's executed well to a point
I mean it takes Robin Williams and shows how he's going slowly descend into this abyss of the things I've seen and it just ropes him into a conspiracy
He's seen the memories of the wrong person and how now people are after him for what he knows
But just the way they ended the movie was so terrible that, {sigh} it's not even worth seeing the whole thing because it just, it just lifts you up to a point where you're just like, this is great
This is the kind of movie that makes you think about how things could end up
How people would be in the future
What people would do after they die and kinda live forever you know
Like they have their memories on their chip and now people would just be like well this is what he was like and this is what he did
But unfortunately, the ending of this movie is too horrible and too disappointing to say this is a good movie
Hello, I'm here to tell you about this crazy movie Sasquatch Mountain
This was just released recently
It was made for Sci-Fi
(uhh) This movie pretty much reeked
(uhh) It has the typical Sci-Fi story line where they're out in the woods and there's monsters killing them one by one and you know
The typical Sci-Fi channel movie
(umm) This movie was just pretty corny
The graphics are bad and everything, the acting
I think there's maybe one or two good actors in this movie that are in some other popular movies
But this movie really stunk and it's not really that entertaining
I don't really recommend you watch it, but if you wanna make fun of it then I'd watch it
This is a review of the most recent movie that I've seen, and (umm) it was Harry Potter and I saw it on, well, I saw the midnight premiere, so it was Friday the twenty-third of July
June
June
And (umm) so this is my ticket
Harry Potter
It says Friday the twenty-second because I saw the type of thing where you see the first part of (umm) Harry Potter seven, and then right after you see the (stutter) second part
So the first part started at eight forty, and (umm) I really liked that because it
(umm) Lets you refresh the memory (umm) of what happened in the first part of the movie
But I don't think they're having that any more
But I really do I really did like the movie
They did a really, really great special effects
(umm) I loved the fight scenes, usually I'm not a huge fight scene fan in movies, but it was really great and had you sitting on the edge of your seat, so I really did like that
(umm) The special effects was great, everything looked so realistic
The acting was great, they really come into their characters
(umm) And I really my favorite part of the movie is at the end, when it has the (umm) shot into the future of what Harry, Ron and Hermione are going to be like in the future
Really, really loved that part
So I really recommend this movie
Hello, I'me here today to talk about Conan The Barbarian
This is the latest Conan The Barbarian
(uhh) Little background, I am a fan of the original Conan The Barbarian movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger (uhh) But I'm more of a fan of the comic book Conan
That's why I went to see this movie
(umm) I kinda knew that it wasn't gonna be the greatest movie in the world when I went to see it because the reviews weren't that great and it's not really doing that great at the box office
But I have heard that it's closer to the comic book in the way that it was originally intended to be when it was written, and by that I mean it's a lot more animistic
A lot more goriness and a lot more hacking and slashing than your typical sword and sorcery movie
(uhh) But where this fell short was on (uhh) several points
(uhh) First of all, the acting wasn't that great
Well (uhh) I guess the acting was okay, but the dialogue they were given was not really anything that someone could work with
I thought Jason Momoa did as good as could be expected and I thought it's actually a fairly convincing Conan in looks and actions
And the supporting cast was all big names, but none of em had any roles
(uhh) You know, Rose McGowan, Rachel Nichols (uhh) Ron Pearlman, they all had little small parts and (uhh) even the ones that had bigger parts, like Rachel Nichols, didn't really add anything to the movie
(umm) Basically what we get is tons of hacking and slashing
(uhh) If you try to count how many limbs are lobbed off in this movie even if you limit it to limbs that were lobbed off by the ax, you're still gonna lose count somewhere around ten thousand
I mean this movie is just incredibly (uhh) gory and violent and while it is truer to the comics, (uhh) the comics did have plot lines and story lines and this movie, sadly, is just a convoluted mess of a plot line
So I will say that Jason Momoa did a fairly good job being Conan and looking like Conan

Hey everybody
My name is Jordan and (uhh) today I will be reviewing the DVD, the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood now wait a second, now wait a second, I know the guys are just, like what in the world, I seen a lot of movies, (umm) I'm willing to watch a movie once for sure I mean anytime, I'm gonna watch a movie
(umm) But, and I always give it the best, you know, benefit of the doubt and like I'm going to sit down and watch this movie I'm going to enjoy it you know
If I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't have to watch it again, if I like it, I'll watch it again
Well this is one I will probably not watch again
(umm) Guys, nobody, you really wouldn't care about this
I really don't think guys will really care about this movie at all
Girls, if you're looking for a birthday present to get your boyfriend or something like that, you would probably want to mark this off your list definitely and (uhh) guys but guys if if (stutter) you're looking for a good movie to give your girlfriend and that's not that expensive, then this will definitely be a good one
(umm) The movie itself, it's it's (stutter) geared, you know, not for guys, it's not action packed or anything like that, (umm) it's not really that interesting, it's just a lot drama stuff, I mean, I just, I just (stutter) didn't like it at all
(umm) Special features, I mean, they have (uhh) commentary, stuff like that but, I mean, I wasn't even interested in watching them because, I mean, who would really want to watch commentary on something that they didn't like in the first place
So (umm) so yes so, guys, this would be a good movie for your girlfriend just make sure she knows, that you know, you're not gonna watch it with her except for one time
(umm) Girls, don't get this for your guy friends, they they (stutter) won't like it
(umm) Yes but so, so (stutter) guys get it for your girlfriends and girls get it for yourself but, anything other than that, you probably wanna skip over it
Hello, I'm Matthew, and I'm here to tell you about this DVD and it's called Ultraviolet
(umm) This is a science-fiction movie made by the same director of the movie Equilibrium, which was an excellent movie
I had high expectations, (umm) because this was, like I said, from the same director of Equilibrium and I was very disappointed
(umm) It's a sci-fi movie but it's very confusing, very choppy, (umm) it's kind of corny too
And it stars the same girl that was in (umm) The Fifth Element and Resident Evil
(umm) The only redeeming thing about this movie is probably the actress that's in it
(umm) She wears very little clothing and that's probably the only redeeming quality, is seeing her run around in (umm) belly shirts
But this is a horrible movie
Hey my name's Scott and today I'm doing a review on a DVD that I probably should've rented before I went out and bought it
(umm) Heard a lot of good reviews about it and a lot of people seem to love this movie, but (umm) when I actually went out and bought the DVD and watched it, I was really disappointed
(umm) I just really didn't like the movie too much
(umm) I know a lot of people loved it and a lot of people think I'm crazy for not enjoying it, but it just wasn't my kind of film
(uhh) The storyline just kind of seemed to drag until it finally got into some action
But (umm) this is, (uhh) it has, it has (stutter) a decent amount of special features on it
all different audios, in (uhh) Mandarin, (uhh) English, French, has subtitles in English and French, (uhh) it has the "Making of" special, a widescreen presentation, a conversation with Michelle Yeoh featurette, a photo montage, link to website, filmographies, animated menus, production notes, and (uhh) scene selections
So, (umm) it's been compared to like The Matrix in ways like that, with sword-fighting and things like that
(umm) Just wasn't really my kind of film
(umm) But, you know, you might want to give it a try
Might say to rent it before you buy the DVD though
(uhh) But if you did like it and you don't have the DVD, definitely pick it up because it does have a lot of good special features
Right here with me today I have the (umm) little heard of DVD called From Justin to Kelly
(umm) This is actually a musical which came out (umm) a few years ago so (umm) of course it's not as a famous anymore
(umm) It's got America's favorite (umm) (stutter) people from the American Idol show (umm) Kelly Clarkson and Justin (uhh) Guarini
(umm) So that's of course the two (stutter) major (umm) stars in this show
(umm) Because these are great (umm) two very talented singers of course this has got to be a musical
It's about (umm) a few people going with their friends to Miami for spring break and then they (uhh) meet up
It's got a lot of music, its got a lot dancing and (uhh) basically the fun never stops in the sun
So (umm) I wouldn't really recommend getting this because it's (uhh) there's a reason it wasn't, it didn't get (umm) such good (uhh) ratings because it's actually quite (stutter) a boring (uhh) plot
There's not much of a plot to it, it's just (uhh) people dancing and singing on the beach and (umm) that's about it
So if you're looking for something with a good plot (umm) I wouldn't suggest this, but maybe if you're looking for something like a sing along type I would suggest this because (uhh) the (umm) the the (stutter) subtitles actually (umm) the captions and everything actually show up as they're saying the words so it's almost like a sing along kind of movie
Hello Rebel, and welcome back to my life
I did get a haircut, thanks for noticing
No, but clearly, something is different on my face

I’m growing my beard back
Turns out I thought my wife really liked the goatee, but we had a conversation a couple of weeks back, and I was like, “I’m glad you like the goatee better, because I find it very fetching,” and she kind of went silent for a really long time
Like, so long I wondered if there was a short-circuit between my brain and my mouth and I had accidentally complimented the good looks of another woman, instead of, like, my own facial hair
But yeah, she said she likes the full beard better, and I like it, too, so it’s coming back
Also I got glasses
Yeeeah, this is still a LITTLE weird, I’m not entirely used to it
Like, I keep reaching up to adjust my glasses when they slide down my nose, and every time I’m like, “Oh my god, I'm adjusting my GLASSES
” So when we moved up here in August, I was driving a truck for three days straight, and I noticed that when I was driving at night, the headlights and tail lights of the other cars were getting a little bit blurry
It wasn’t anything crazy, but it was definitely a higher level of blur than I had previously experienced in my life, which was, like … none
So the day after my birthday I finally went to the optometrist and found out that I have a mild astigmatism, which makes long-distance vision a little bit blurry, especially at night
The optometrist said I only really HAVE to wear them when I'm driving at night, but when I put them on, everything became so much clearer that I just … wear them all the time now
The first day I got my glasses, I was a little bit down
I’ve always had perfect vision, and so it felt in a sense like I was “losing” that
But both of my parents had glasses since before I was born, so this is not some, like, huge surprise out of nowhere
It was pretty much inevitable
And after that first day, once I’d gotten used to wearing them, I found out that I actually really like how they look
I mean, for one thing, if you tell people you’re a writer, I feel like they’re a lot more likely to take you seriously if you DO have glasses than if you DON’T
But also, I feel—and I know this sounds kind of stupid—but I feel like the glasses complete my face in this weird way
Like I’ve never really hated the way I look, but I’ve never thought I was super good-looking either
And the glasses have definitely caused an improvement in my concept of my own self-image, whatever that’s worth
I don’t know that I chose the best possible frames
I might upgrade those at some point
And I definitely need to get non-glare lenses, since as you can see, they have a tendency to reflect the lights I use to make my videos
But overall, yeah, I like myself better with glasses than without them
There is one other aspect of this whole thing, though, which is less than completely ideal
And that’s that … it DOES make me feel a little old
No, glasses are not exclusive to old people
A lot of kids wear glasses from a very young age
My son Luke is getting his eyes checked in April because we’ve known for a long time that he will almost DEFINITELY need glasses growing up, and he’s finally of the age where he will PROBABLY not break them

But I wasn’t born with eyes that needed glasses
It happened because I got old

Also gonna be real weird every time I go back and watch one of my old YouTube videos, which I do every once in a while, and see myself without the glasses
Not probably never gonna get over that system shock
The way I feel isn’t exactly a mid-life crisis, but it’s kind of akin to one
But it’s also made me realize that I’m pretty okay with where I am at this point in my life
I’m 31, I make a living as an author, I’ve got an incredible wife and three wonderful children, we got a real nice house in a real nice town in Oregon
We're probably gonna be getting our own house in the not-too-distant future
If that’s the situation I'm in as I move into my new bespectacled life as a middle-aged man, I’m sort of okay with it
And that is all I've got for you today, Rebel
You know, the Lord Jesus convicted me of having "false fronts", when I am out in public.
You know, we don't want to look, vulnerable, or we don't want to look like we are not busy.
So when we go out in public we try to keep calm and collected, but.
IF you do not have Jesus on the FRONT of YOU, then you will not bear witness for Jesus, you will NOT testify because you are too cool, or you are too busy.
I see a lot of people going around with a "false front", they pretend that they are SO busy with their cell phones, that they are too busy to talk.
Or they are too "cool". If you watch them they act like they are WAY to cool to talk to anyone.
But these things will HINDER YOU if you are trying to live for Jesus.

Tammy and Eric were faced with an agonizing decision
We said we could deliver at that point
Her survivability was quoted, basically, at 0%
The other option was to try to get her to 27 weeks, and then deliver her with a survivability-- probably still under the 5% number
Tammy was put on bed rest, every other day she went to the hospital to see if the baby was still alive

TAMMY: I remember every day, sitting in the car before we would walk into the clinic
It was-- you take a big, deep breath, and you prepare yourself that there's not going to be a heartbeat today
And every time, there was a heartbeat
NARRATOR: At 27 weeks, the doctor told Tammy she had to deliver the baby immediately, or the baby would die
They prepared Tammy for a c-section
One of the best ways to articulate your skills, experience, knowledge, and your overall worth in today's competitive job market is to create your personal brand
I feel that a personal brand is obligatory and it helps you stand out in the crowd
According to the management expert and author Tom Peters, we are CEOs of our own companies, Me Inc
To be in business today, our most important job is to be the head marketer of our own personal brands
This is the first of a 2-part video on personal branding
In this video, I will share 7 pointers on personal branding to get you started
First, determine your unique value proposition
Spend some time thinking about what makes you different from your peers
Identify your strengths, your passions, and your goals
If you left your job today, what would your company &amp; colleagues miss? Know who you are and who you are not
Second, find out how others see you
Ask your trusted colleagues, co-workers, and friends for four or five adjectives they would use to describe you
Try to find out what are you good at
What are your strengths? In which areas do they see you as irreplaceable? Third, identify your goals
Where would you like to be in six months? In one year? In five years? In ten years? Defining your goals is necessary to craft a message that helps you reach them
Fourth, identify your target audience
Just like Starbucks knows that their target audience is coffee drinkers, you need to define to whom you want to send your message
This will not only help you hone your message, but, it also helps you deliver it to the right people at the right places
Fifth, reorganize your priorities
You are probably used to putting yourself behind your company, co-workers, and clients
You still want to be loyal to those groups, but, be loyal to yourself, first
Sixth, pay attention to the details
Everything you do ultimately contributes to your personal brand
Once you have defined your brand, make sure that those little things, such as the way you dress, the way you speak, your body language, your behavior with colleagues and other stakeholders the emails you write, etc
are consistent with your brand message
Seventh, update your CV or Resume
Go through your CV or Resume to determine whether it gels with your personal brand
Ensure that your CV or Resume accurately defines who you are, and is in line with your short-term and long-term goals
In the next video, I will share 7 more pointers on personal branding
As an entrepreneur, when you start working with an investor, there are some compromises that are going to have to be made.
And one way of thinking about that is when you make your first pitch to an investor, the investor starts formulating in their mind what they think this company should become, what the product should be.
And that may not be the same idea that you have in your head as the entrepreneur.
And actually, part of picking the right investors is, is there alignment between these visions, the vision that the investor shares and the vision that the entrepreneur shares?
And no matter how close those two visions are, sometimes there's going to be some differences.
And as an entrepreneur, what you have to decide is when the investor's vision is slightly different, are you going to adjust?
Are you going to course correct?
And when you're thinking about doing that and you're thinking about those compromises, it's important to take a step back and think about it from the investor's perspective.
They're not in the weeds.
How important is your pre-trial testimony in your accident or medical malpractice case here in the state of New York?
You wanna learn the answer?
Come join me, I'll tell you.
Hi, I'm Gerry Oginski; I'm a New York medical malpractice and personal injury trial attorney practicing law here in the state of New York.
Your pre-trial testimony is critical for the purposes of testifying at trial.
Why is that?
Because it is as if you are testifying at trial even though you're at a question and answer session in your attorney's office.
You might think that it's very informal because there's no judge there, there's no jury there, it's not a court room but the reality is that every question and answer that's given in that particular case is now recorded into a booklet, you are sworn to tell the truth and that testimony will then come back to haunt you if you testify in a manner that is contradictory at the time of trial.
So the testimony you give during your question and answer session, also known as a deposition or an examination before trial, is critical, it is the same as if you are testifying at trial.
It just happens to be done in an attorney's office.
SPOKESPERSON KIRBY: The U.S.
Government judges North Korea to have conducted a nuclear test yesterday.
We’re still evaluating the North’s claims  about this test, but our initial analysis is not consistent with North Korea’s claim that this was a hydrogen bomb.
In any event, we strongly condemn this violation of UN Security Council resolutions, and again call on North Korea to abide by its international obligations and commitments.
We have consistently made clear that we will not accept North Korea as a nuclear-armed state.
Since last night, we’ve been in constant contact with our allies and partners in the region.
Secretary Kerry spoke today over the phone with the foreign minister of the Republic of Korea, Foreign Minister Yun.
It seems to me that the best brands increasingly the gap that they have with their lowest performing competitors.
I learned that my mom had a right to own property, I learned that did not have to abused because she was a women
Those things made me angry
I wanted to do something
Every time I went back, I found that my neighbours' girls were getting married, they were getting mutilated
And after I graduated from here, I worked at the UN, I went back to school to get my graduate work, the constant cry of these girls was on my face
I had to do something
As I went back, I started talking to the men, to the village, and mothers and I said, "I want to give back the way I had promised you that I would come back and help you

In this clip on how to audition for a Broadway play, I'm going to talk about the journey in your monologue.
Not only should you have an objective, and should you know who you're talking to in your monologue, but you want to show a little bit of a character journey, so that you show the casting directors and the producers, and whoever is on that audition panel, that you're an actress who can carry a show.
You can go from point A to point B.

My name is Susan Richmond.
I just recently graduated with a first class degree studying forensic science and investigative analysis.
The reason I chose Kingston University is probably two reasons.
Firstly, I attended an open day and during that open day I got a really good impression of the university - everybody was friendly, everybody was very welcoming, the talks relating to my course were very interesting, which enabled me to make my final decision.
Secondly, I live close to the University - I have a young family and it's convenient for me.
The idea of travelling long distances just does not appeal to me, particularly with family life and studies.
I studied forensic science and investigative analysis.
The course covered quite a broad range of topics.
The topics kind of ranged from forensic bio-psychology to fibres, fires and firearms, forensic archaeology.
I suppose these topics combined with the practical skills that we learnt, such as the crime scene to court scenarios.
Having them combined together gave me a really big insight, or a fantastic insight, into the actual course itself and into forensic science.
I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Kingston University.
A despicable hate crime was committed this evening in Jerusalem.
In Israel everyone, including the LGBT community, has the right to live in peace, And we will defend that right.
I welcome the Israeli religious leadership's condemnation of this terrible crime And I call on all those in positions of leadership to denounce this contemptible act.
In the name of all of Israelis, I wish the wounded a full and speedy recovery.
Hey everybody what's up i am doing a review of fast and the furious 7. I saw a prescreener of it last night.
This is the seventh installment of the series and Paul Walkers and now a lot of people were wondering what would the series was going to do with Paul Walkers death he filmed about half of the movie and he is in the movie.
I think a lot of people were wondering whether they would just not have his character in the movie, he actually is in the movie for a good portion of it and in fact you'll be watching this movie and wondering which scene are they going to off his character at and that's what i was wondering during the entire time of hte movie.
Now the story continues off from where the 6th one left off we saw Dominic Teretto and Brian O'Connor Paul Walkers character defeat Owen Shaw in the sixth movie and now Owen Shaw's brother who is played by Jason Statham is back and he basically wants revenge for his brothers death.
The movie introduces some new characters.
Iggy Azalea makes a short appearance even if it is for a few seconds.
We have kurt russell whose in the movie for a good portion of it.
Well I'm very glad to be -- Welcome, everybody, and  thank you for --starting a moment late.
I apologize.
I'm very happy to be meeting today with Marshall Islands President Loeak and with the Samoan Prime Minister Malielegaoi  and other Pacific Island leaders.
We're very happy to have all of you here.
This week these leaders and other leaders from around the globe have come to New York during the UN General Assembly to discuss some of the issues of greatest challenge to everybody, life and death issues that impact millions of people around the world.
Climate change is one issue that absolutely impacts millions of people around the world, and no one knows just how deeply serious and present, how now this challenge is and its impacts than the people of the vulnerable Pacific Islands.
They have experienced both historic droughts and the highest rates of sea level rise in the world.
So the science is clear and irrefutable, and today the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirmed for the fifth time in 20 years that climate change is real, is happening, and is in large part caused by human activity.

In Texas, what do you need to do to prepare for a temporary order hearing? Hi
I'm Eric Engel, a Dallas divorce lawyer with the Engel Law Group here in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area
A temporary order hearing is a hearing in which the court sets the ground rules for who gets what property, what debts get paid, who gets custody of the children, and how much child support - if any - gets paid while the divorce is going through the court system
In Texas, there are four things you need to do to prepare for your temporary order hearing
One: Texas is a conservative state, so you need to be conservatively dressed
This means that if you are a man, you should be wearing a suit and you should be cleanly shaven
If you are a woman, you should be wearing a long dress or a professional business suit
Two: you need to arrive to court on time
You don't want to be late when it comes to deciding whether or not you're going to be able to keep custody of your kids
Three: you want to make sure that you're friendly towards the other and you're friendly towards the court staff
If you're rude to the court staff, this has a way of getting back to the judge who won't take it kindly and may actually make you pay more money or take away custody of your children
Four: you want to make sure that you deliver all the papers to the other side into the court in a timely manner
Why am I telling you this? I'm telling you this because you've just been served with papers for a temporary order hearing or you're preparing for a temporary order hearing yourself in the state of Texas
These are the sort of problems we deal with every day
If you find yourself in this situation, pick up the phone and give us a call
just this is going to be kind of a dry paste that is how we want it
now take this quails and then apply the masala all out just into the gashes just apply
You know, in the roundtables that I held throughout our district, I heard from family members, law enforcement, and treatment specialists, who are trying to deal with this terrible addiction of opioids, of painkillers, that's gotten out of hand.
The legislation that we've put forward that's been approved by the House now really will make a difference in our communities over time.
Good morning Hank, it's Tuesday.
What do I have in common with a Catholic priest?
I'd just feel naked without my collar.
It's Question Tuesday, the day that I answer real question from real Nerdfighter Just the one question today: "I'm a college freshman, how do I figure out what the hell to do with my life?" Hank, we get some version of this question almost every day, but to answer the question, I have to begin by disagreeing with it.
The whole "what do I do with my life?" question implies that adulthood is this monolithic creature that like, you acquire your job and your spouse, and then you just ride it out until Time's winged chariot shows up.
I thought this when I was younger too, and it's not our fault, because how does every single happily ever after movie end?
With finding your one true love and kissing them, occasionally marrying them, at the very latest having a child with them.
95% of romantic stories end with partners committing to each other, because everything after that is just the blank, terrifying morass of adulthood, this monotonous grind in which the only real excitement in your life is occasionally finding a truly ripe avocado at the grocery store.
Now listen, Hank, I'm not going to lie to you, I get very excited when I find a truly ripe avocado at the grocery store but it's not the only excitement in my life!
And let me submit that one of the reasons you're so terrified of figuring out what you're going to do with your life is that you think you're only going to be able to do one thing!
Like if someone told you that in four years you were going to have to pick one musical note to listen to for the rest of your life, you would spend a lot of time being super anxious about which note to pick and the various tonal qualities of different notes.
But that's not what life is like!
You will always be figuring out what to do with your life, and you'll get to do lots of different things, and your decisions will be unmade by circumstance, like your wife gets a job in Kuala Lumpur, or you're staring at the night sky one night and decide you wanna get a PhD in astrophysics Or your uncle dies and there's no one to take over his junkyard or your little brother starts a frickin' video conference... Just like your life now, adulthood will have all this tension between idealism and practicality, and you'll have to balance competing desires.
I mean, give yourself some credit!
Even if you're 14 or 15, you're already kind of doing adulthood.
But I think what actually scared me about choosing whether to go to school and what to study was that each time I made a decision, my options narrowed.
Hi, My name's Taylor Eubanks, and thank you for being interested in my story.
So, I just want to do a short video telling you why I want to go to Germany and how you can help me get there.
It started last summer when i started learning Germany from a friend of mine.
For some reason, as soon as they started teaching me German, i couldn't stop learning the language!
So I would do YouTube videos on how to learn and oddly enough, I started meeting many people in Texas from Germany... and I don't know where they've been hiding all this time but I started to get suspicious that maybe the Lord was speaking to me to go there.
So I asked him and prayed several times, "God do you want me to go to Germany, and what do you want me to do there?" and he said "Yes." and he wants me to go through a ministry called Greater Europe Mission.
Basically, Europe is a very secular place, and I know Germany is a country in need of God's love.
Only about 2-3% of them are committed Christians.
So my goal is to go there this summer from June 10 to August 26 and just love on them like Jesus does and build relationships.
I know whenever you hear the words "Mission Trips", you might think of third world countries who need money and resources, but Germany has all that.
They just need God's love.
I'm so excited to go there.
&gt;&gt;Fernando Nilo - Davos Debates 2009 Hi YouTube community.
My name is Fernando Nilo.
I am a [inaudible] entrepeneur from [inaudible] and I'm here in Davos and I would like to share my dream, mass ideas with the community.
The devil will accuse true Brothers, Our Brethren!
He accuses them day and night and brings many accusations against them.
He says they are false brothers; they are hypocrites, that they are prideful, he brings MANY false accusations against them hoping that they will THINK that is from the Holy Spirit and believe those accusations, and stumble and fall, and that they won�t be able to testify of Jesus anymore.
The devil is a LIAR and he tries to deceive people.
The realm of what actually is and the realm of what ought to be are logically disconnected
For instance, one may not conclude that because stealing is morally and legally prohibited, it does not happen
Conversely, it cannot be concluded either that because stealing does occur in practice, it is morally or legally acceptable
However, although the realm of what ought to be is not logically connected with reality, it does pull it, to some extent, toward what is considered desirable, in the manner of a gravitational force
&gt;&gt; Congratulations! You made it to the end of this segment and successfully answered all the quiz questions correctly
You may now move onto the next section of this orientation
I understand that I can stop my external speaking, by just not doing it, but how do I stop my internal speaking?
The same way, it’s the same.
External and internal is just made up.
You know when I was saying that …the way we segment our lives?
The major segmentation we make is external and internal.

This is Bruce Campbell Versus Army of Darkness the Director's Cut Official Bootleg Edition
Now this is probably the worst cut of this movie I've ever seen
It just doesn't sit right with me
(uhh) It has about fifteen minutes of extra deleted material, (uhh) which was deleted for a reason
It's just (uhh) it's alright, it just doesn't, it's not necessary
The thing that really bothers me about this cut is the editing
It doesn't give you an option as to which ending you see, you're stuck with the apocalyptic ending
Where if you like that ending then you're probably good with this
But I really didn't like the apocalyptic ending, it just left me disappointed
But (uhh) if you saw the movie, you know what I'm talking about
If you didn't, you'll have to see it to understand
But (uhh) this (uhh) (uhh) it just (uhh) it's just (stutter) not a good cut
It's just cause of whoever put in deleted scenes, they're grainy
(uhh) Like if you're gonna if you're gonna (stutter) do a director's cut where you put in deleted scenes, at least (uhh) make them look as nice as the rest of the movie you know? Because then it just kind of detracts from what you're watching
(umm) Okay so I will explain the movie now so I got that out of the way
(uhh) Bruce Campbell reprises his role as Ash in the third installment of the Evil Dead series, though this is Army of Darkness, not exactly Evil Dead
(uhh) It's more of an a action comedy than (umm) any of the other ones were horror
It's more of a an action oriented (uhh) one liner spouting hero (uhh) has is (stutter) trapped seven hundred years in the past and in order to get out, he has to find, of course, the Necronomicon
And (uhh) and many hijinx ensue with his search for the Necronomicon and (uhh) the resolutions afterwards
What goes on afterwards
(uhh) But (uhh) he ends up obviously having to take on the army of darkness
(uhh) The thing is though that there's several freight, he's in medieval time basically
(uhh) Very arcane, (uhh) non-technological, but it still goes with the idea that (umm) That (uhh) he (uhh) somehow has the knowledge to (uhh) (uhh) create and build whatever he wants out of what he can find
I'm here to present to you Man of the Year starring Robin Williams
(uhh) It also has the supporting characters of Lewis (stutter) Black and Christopher Walken (stutter) and Jeff Goldblum
But they're just the supporting characters the other two main characters Laura Linney and the guy that plays the evil face of delacorp, the company that (umm) the company that causes most of the conflict through this movie
Weren't really people I identified
So (uhh) if you're watching this for the comedy aspects, (uhh) it's kind of few and far between but they are funny I will say that, the, (stutter) whenever they try to be funny they are funny
But then there are just parts where it gets so dark and so dramatic that (umm) it just kinda overshadows any comedy that's there and just eventually becomes a straight (uhh) suspense drama you know
(umm) Like I had complete expectations of seeing Robin Williams (uhh) stand up
(uhh) I've seen some of the comedy works he done (uhh) classic tv shows he's done
But this movie is just (uhh) it's, it's kind of got a conflict of interest in the story
See the whole story behind this movie is, that Robin Williams plays a character named Tom Dobbs who has a politically charged (uhh) television show, a talk show
Where he'll (uhh) express his opinions obviously (uhh) much like (uhh) Jon Stewart of the Daily Show or Steve Colbert of the Colbert Report
But (uhh) he tongue in cheekingly (uhh) claims that he's going to run for president
And, and this is after an audience, (uhh) an audience member on one of his shows tells him to do this he decides to go through with it
So he does, he runs for president and he actually gets into the, into the into the (stutter) voting system
And (uhh) that's where the point is that earlier in the movie they showed there was a glitch in the voting system
That the movie is based around the idea that this company has created this voting system that will streamline voting making it easier for the for the (stutter) voter to just go in and just hit a few (stutter) buttons and their vote's counted
(uhh) But a glitch is discovered early on in the movie but instead of fixing it they create this big (uhh) this big conspiracy story to cover it up
(uhh) There are a lot of elements of that which is actually what ruined the movie for me is it took it away from the comedy and made it more of a (uhh) (uhh) (uhh) the seedy underbelly of, of politics which obviously we know is there, but I just, I just wanted something about politics that didn't present that for once that actually just gave you a a (stutter) here's a a (stutter) silly, tongue in cheek rendition of what would happen if a comedian became president here's the country now, you know
I mean some people think yeah but that would just be Idiocracy you know, which Mike Judge did that movie, but no, it wouldn't I mean Robin Williams has a lot of great points in his stand up his character also has a lot of great points which reflects
But just the direction they went with it just showed a lack of creativity and they just decided to go with the paranoia angle instead of the comedy angle, which I think they should have focused on
But (umm) the lengths that the company goes to, the company by the way with the unnamed face of I believe the character's name is Matthias played by Dan Murray who's the kind of the face of Delacorp that makes sure everything goes the, according to plan
And his (uhh) representatives played by Jeff Goldblum
So at least you get good actors out of it I mean Robin Williams, Lewis Black, Christopher Walken
(uhh) Which also brings in more (uhh) dramatic elements you know kind of Rocky Balboa ish you know, you know push this issue because I'm going through and you'll see this, you'll see this in the movie
(uhh) (uhh) Laura Linney Jeff Goldblum, (uhh) Delacorp employees and Dan Murray as Matthias playing the lead (uhh) face of Delacorp
But honestly this movie just does not measure up, I did not, I didn't like it
I liked the comedy elements I liked what he had to say I like how he handled the debate
But pretty much everything (uhh) every other character did other than Christopher Walken or Lewis Black I didn't like
I'm reviewing the dvd Chasing Liberty
Chasing Liberty is about a girl named Anna who is the president's only daughter
(umm) Anna is tired of always being followed around by secret service agents and she really wants to have some fun and enjoy her freedom before she goes to college
While she's on a trip with her parents she meets a boy and they sneak off and travel all over Europe together, and eventually she finds out that the boy had been lying to her all this time and he was really a secret service agent himself
So by this time Anna has of course fallen in love with him
But after some ups and downs she eventually gets over the fact that he lied to her and realizes that he really did love her
(uhh) This wasn't a horrible movie, it was just too much like every other teenage romantic movie
If you like chick flicks it's pretty good, the actors and actresses aren't bad and the storyline is kind of cute
But it was just kind of cliche
There are not many hunourous, funny poems out there.
But here is one by T S Elliot.
"The Naming of Cats" The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter, It isn't just one of your holiday games; You may think at first I'm as mad as a hatter When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.
First of all, there's the name that the family use daily, Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo or James, Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey- All of them sensible everyday names.
There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter, Some for the gentlemen, some for the dames Such as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter-- But all of them sensible everyday names.
Hi, today I'm going to be reviewing the movie MouseHunt
(umm) It's supposedly the funniest movie of the year, it says on the DVD
It stars Nathan Lane and Lee Evans
(umm) It's (uhh) PG, and it's about an hour and thirty minutes
(umm) It has some special features on the DVD of (umm) production notes, cast and filmmaker's biographies and stuff
Not too much, but (uhh) the movie itself (umm) is okay
(umm) Well, it's supposed to be the funniest movie of the year, but {sigh} I don't really think that's true
(umm) It's kind of one of those silly type of funny movies
(umm) So I don't know if you enjoy that
(umm) I tend not to like those {noise} type of movies, because I don't know, they're not really funny to me
But, if you wanna check it out, it's okay to see maybe once or twice
Oh boy, this one is bad
It's (uhh) Covert One: The Hades Factor
(uhh) It's (stutter) based on a series of silly (umm) FBI, CIA kind of government secret agent novels
(umm) This one's called The Hades Factor
It's about (uhh) the disease that's starting to breakout and (uhh) this agent has to discover the source before it breaks out everywhere and kills millions of people
It stars (uhh) Mira Sorvino and Stephen Dorff
(uhh) The movie unfortunately goes on and on and on
It feels like it's never gonna end and that's not helped by the fact that it's over two and a half hours long
I think it actually comes in at almost two hours and forty-five minutes
Do yourself a favor, don't watch this
(uhh) There's no reason to sit through three hours of bad movie
Hello there
My name is Adam and (uhh) right now I am going to review the movie called Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon
(umm) This movie is directed by Ang Lee
It was released (uhh) few years ago I guess now (umm) and (uhh) it's got (uhh) some interesting (uhh) special effects, a lot of (uhh) wired effects where people are flying around and that and (uhh) it was (uhh) as you can see in the front here, winner of four academy awards
It was very well reviewed and liked by the critics
(umm) The (uhh) DVD itself has a lot of special features on it
(uhh) It's got a lot of behind the scenes things and all that
(uhh) I will be perfectly honest though, (umm) I didn't really find this movie that interesting, I found it hard to follow what was going on, and (uhh) it just wasn't my cup of tea at all
(umm) I would probably give it maybe (uhh) at best a two out of five, (uhh) you know, because it's (uhh) international film, you know, (stutter) so give you a little bit of different culture (umm) which I get is, is (stutter) you know kinda interesting, but (uhh) I (uhh) probably wouldn't recommend people going to see this
It's (uhh) a renting
WAS COMPLETED, I THINK, BY THE MARCH
OR YOU COULD SAY IT WAS COMPLETED BY THE FOUR LITTLE GIRLS WHO WERE KILLED AFTER THE MARCH
THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY MARCH AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE BOMBING OF THAT CHURCH, WHERE KENNEDY WAS AND WHY HE WAS MOVING
HIS LAST WORDS, AS HE GOT ON THE PLANE GOING TO DALLAS, WERE CHEERFUL BECAUSE HE HAD GOTTEN THE WORD THAT THE CIVIL-RIGHTS BILL THAT HE HAD SENT UP WAS GOING TO BE PERMITTED TO GO TO THE FLOOR BY THE KEY COMMITTEE THAT WAS BLOCKING IT
Hi, today I'm presenting a movie opinion on the movie Employee of the Month
(uhh) This movie is starring Dane Cook and Jessica Simpson
It also has Andy Dick in it
(umm) I would give this movie about a five out of ten
(umm) The acting wasn't any particularly very good and it wasn't very funny, it's supposed to be a comedy
I would say it's for (umm) people between the ages of about thirteen to twenty-five in that range
(umm) It had its moments but for the most part it's just one of those (umm) stupid comedies (umm) it's about a employee of this like, store who (umm) does slacks off a lot and (umm) this really pretty girl, Jessica Simpson, who moves to the store and he finds out that she really likes employees of the month
So he starts out working really hard trying to get employee of the month so he can win the girl
And so he runs and he also has an, an (stutter) enemy in the store who's also trying to get employee of the month and so they fight over the position
And so it's kind of entertaining but I wouldn't recommend watching it unless you're pretty bored
Hi, today I'm presenting a movie opinion on a movie that's in theaters right now called The Hills Have Eyes Two
(umm) I thought this movie was really, really bad
(umm) It's supposed to be scary and stuff, but I didn't really feel scared, it was just like a lot of goriness and stuff to it
(umm) I didn't really like the acting, I didn't really know anybody that was in it, so (umm) I thought it would be scary (umm) the previews made it look like that but it really wasn't
(umm) It's about these like, (uhh) like (stutter) training guys that are (uhh) in the desert and on their last day they get attacked by these mutants
(umm) They're national guard trainees, and (umm) I don't think like it's not very good, it's not very gore, like the goriness sucks, the acting sucks, (umm) the storyline sucks, it's just like one of those like, (uhh) like, (stutter) there it's like a typical horror film that they tried to make scary and stuff but I didn't really feel like it was like that at all
Hi, today I'm presenting the movie Pride, which is playing in theaters right now
It has (uhh) Tom Arnold, (umm) Bernie Mac and a guy named (stutter) Terrance Howard
(umm) I'm not really sure who he is, (umm) but he's the lead actor
(umm) It's about this guy who starts, finds kind of like this abandon pool, and starts like a (umm) swimming team for troubled youth and (umm) I would not recommend this movie
It was absolutely terrible
The acting was terrible
It wasn't very good at all
It would just be a waste of money
(umm) It also got terrible reviews from professional critics as well
(uhh) I don't know why I went to go see it
(uhh) I thought it looked interesting
(umm) But yeah, it's a terrible terrible movie and it's a waste of time
(umm) It's not a very like, the story line wasn't very good and (umm) the acting seemed kind of corny
The lines they used like, doesn't really seem like real life stuff
(umm) They tried to make it like inspirational kind of thing but not really
Hello, I'm Matthew and I'm here to tell you about this DVD movie
It came out in two thousand and five and it is called Birth
It stars Nicole Kidman
(umm) She plays a recently widow and then it jumps forward to ten years later and she is getting remarried
When a mysterious boy comes and pretends to be her husband reincarnated
(umm) The acting was okay
(umm) The directing was okay, but I don't know if they were trying to make it (umm) sweet and romantic but it kind of comes off a little creepy, a little weird
(umm) The little boy is about eight or nine in it and she's about thirty, thirty-five
(umm) Late thirties and it comes off kind of creepy, there's (umm) (umm) a nude scene involving her and the young child and she's going to run away with him and (umm) they kiss in the movie and, and instead of coming off sweet and endearing it comes off a little (umm) weird and really creepy and a little uncomfortable
MICHAEL JONES: I think it's vital.
I can't actually think of any taht actually believe will survive long term if they don't.
I've got to wonder who out there is watching Steven Seagall movies
I mean obviously I watched this because I hate myself
But (uhh) somebody out there has to be buying these and (uhh) actually enjoying them, so that they continue to buy more of them because he keeps on making movies and I can't figure it out because they're terrible
And (uhh) I have to actually restrain myself on the couch before I put the movie (uhh) on play to watch it because otherwise I just end up throwing whatever I can find at the tv in an effort to (uhh) (stutter) break it whatever, his smug fat face comes on the camera
(uhh) I guess I should get to the point this movie Black Dawn, (uhh) he plays a ex-CIA agent, (uhh) has to (uhh) stop terrorists from releasing a nuclear weapon
I'm (uhh) sitting here trying to figure out if I've ever seen a Wesley Snipes movie that I enjoyed
(umm) I guess the answer is probably no, because (uhh) this is maybe the (stutter) one of the worst movies I've seen him in so far, and that's saying a lot for (uhh) Wesley Snipes
This movie is called The Marksman, this is the DVD release
(uhh) It's ninety-five minutes long
There are no special features on here at all
(umm) It is high-def but (uhh) doesn't matter, it's a bad movie
(umm) He plays a special forces soldier who has to go stop Russian terrorists at a nuclear power plant and (uhh) there, you've seen the whole movie
(uhh) Like I said, there's no special features on here
(uhh) I really didn't care that much because I wouldn't have wanted to see them anyway, but (uhh) this movie is just a real stinker
Hi, I'm reviewing the DVD release of (uhh), Python
(umm), If you've seen Lake Placid, or Anaconda, or any of those, this is basically just a, a rip-off of those
And, (uhh), since it's ripping of a couple of pretty poor movies, it's probably no surprise that this one's even worse
(umm), The first thing going against it is that there stars Casper Van Dien, who in my opinion, has never been good in anything except for maybe Starship Troopers
(umm), There's no special features on the disc
(uhh) Which may be a blessing because once the movies over you wouldn't want to see anymore anyway
But, (uhh), this movie is basically about an hour and a half of (uhh), poorly done special effects
A computer generated snake chasing around (uhh) man and naked girls
I know that sounds good but (stutter) it's not
Hi
Today I'm going to be reviewing the movie Best Laid Plans
It stars Reese Witherspoon
(umm) Relationships can be murder
(umm) It's the special edition
(uhh) It's rated R and (umm) {mumble} one and a half hours long
(umm) The movie is about (umm) a guy (umm) who (umm) owes some money and (umm) he (umm) ends up robbing and it go, ends up being bad
(umm) And so he's left (umm) owing this guy money in, like, 48 hours or he's going to die
And since his robbery went bad (umm) he takes what the movie says, desperate measures to (umm) well, undertakes drastic measures to get his hands on some fast cash
But (umm) he works with his girlfriend, who is Reese Witherspoon (umm) to (umm) get some cash quick to pay of his (umm) debt
(umm) It has some bonus features (umm) some deleted scenes, alternate endings, cast and crew bios, and other stuff like that
(umm) But as for the movie itself, (umm) I didn't really care for it
(umm) My husband liked it, but (umm) I thought it was pretty boring
(umm) That's it
I just didn't care for it
It's kind of like a, it's a (stutter) drama movie, action
Hey there we are talking about introductory speeches and now you get to find out the golden number, the time limit.
ROBBIE TRAUBE: The direction that we see it is there's a pervasive nature of how you can leverage some of the creation of content and so.
Hi, the Two Witnesses are here, Peter and Mary.
Hey, what's up? Okay, today I'm going to be reviewing a movie
This is Nicolas Cage
He's in this movie called Gone in Sixty Seconds
Gone in Sixty Seconds is a remake of a seventies film by the same name and basically it's about a car a car (stutter) thief gang that has to steal a certain number of cars within a short period of time, and (uhh) this movie involves a lot of car chases obviously, and it involves a lot of fast cars, a lot of fancy cars
You'll see lots of Ferraris and Lamborghinis
If you like (uhh) if you like that kind of thing then this, this movie could be for you
I was actually disappointed, I was hoping for a lot more, I don't know why
I've been disappointed by Nicolas Cage many times
(uhh) Also this is a Jerry Bruckheimer film and (umm) I don't really like Jerry Bruckheimer
I don't think he (uhh) I don't think he really cares about making good movies, he cares about making movies that make money
So it's lots of explosions, lots of action, but not necessarily a lot of interesting action
It doesn't always seem motivated plot wise
(uhh) Ultimately if you haven't seen it, if you haven't seen Gone in Sixty Seconds go rent this original seventies version, you'll probably get more entertainment out of that
I give (uhh) the modern Gone in Sixty Seconds two out of five
How many times do I have to tell you to clean up your room? Sound familiar? Your adolescent is going to test you in many ways - from a challenge to clean up their room, to your position on world peace
So what is the parent supposed to do? My suggestion to you is to pick your battles very wisely
Not every situation requires a big battle, and it's important for parents and adolescents to navigate those waters and figure out which battles are worth fighting
So how to do that? I have three points for you
First point, most important point



Take a step back
Give yourself a few minutes to sort out the situation

As you're considering what to do about this reaction from your adolescent, I suggest you begin by looking at yourself
Try to understand why this is so important to you
Why are you feeling the way you're feeling? What is the serious part about this? And what is just the emotional part about this? You kind of have to sort yourself out first, so then you can move ahead and deal with the situation
My third point is


you're the adult, so you have to be the adult in the argument
You need to figure out a way to navigate the situation so that it doesn't turn into a big conflict
Next Tuesday's video is called the Art of Renegotiation, so if you find this point a little difficult, make sure and join me next week and we'll talk about it some more
There are going to be situations that come up between you and your adolescent that you've got to respond to and there's gonna be problems
As long as you're careful and you pick those battles very wisely, you can guide them and teach them and help them as they mature through this process
But think about it
If you use Twitter, you've probably agonized over the construction of a tweet
You can't just say whatever you want and go all willy-nilly with your character count
There are rules here
Well, actually, there's kind of only one rule
Twitter's 140-character limit forces you to creative in your tweet construction
"Each time Mark made advances toward Marie, she'd immediately pretend she was asleep
This made for awkward office lunches
" And the relationship between constraint and creativity is like peanut butter and jelly, like Toejam and Earl, like John Woo and doves
Self-imposed, technologically determined, or culturally developed, constraint is oftentimes the very basis of creativity
Filmmaker Orson Welles even said that the absence of limitation is the enemy of art
"I'm gonna take that as a sign you're not ready "or that it's not a good time for you, "and so I won't stay in that case
" And so you're saying things like, you're not saying "You should" or "You can't," anything about them
You're saying, "This is where I am
"This is what I can do
"This is what I require
" And making it very, very clear and concrete and drawing a line in the sand that then you have to follow through on
You absolutely have to follow through on it
And this is really important about the narcissism epidemic thing
If we wanna put an end to that, what's really important is that you do things like this because your kids are watching, and then they will see that you stood up for yourself, you stood up for them, and you ended it here
I made a video a few weeks ago called The Most Important Part of the Pitching Delivery and to summarize that video, I just say that the most important part of the pitching delivery is the beginning because everything that happens later is an effect to what you do in the beginning
For your question specifically about how to get this back leg to not drag around or to get it up more, more up and over heel to sky, two things have to happen
Your player may be lacking in one or in both of those areas
The first one is the amount of energy and speed that he creates going down the mount in linear fashion, his linear energy
Now, the first thing that you want to do before you get up and do anything, is I want to take your outline.
Hi, Heidi Thorne.
Have you ever gotten a promotional product invoice that was for a quantity more than what you ordered?
That's actually a quality control measure.
They are not trying to cheat you.
Here is what happens.
When you place your order, the supplier or manufacturer runs more than what you've ordered so that they can spot-check the order and take out any products that don't meet standard, so that they can meet the quantity that you did order.
So what were your reactions?
I though it was really interesting how he went into dialogue.
Because most people, we think we go into dialogue because that will change our opinions and help shape what we see.
Well, he went into dialogue not to change his opinion.
He didn't want to change his opinion.
Let’s find out what went wrong.
As usual, looking at a graph clarifies a lot.
In the picture, you see a graph of the left hand side of the inequality, y=1/(x^2-1), in blue and the graph of the right hand side, the horizontal line y=1, in green.
The solutions to this inequality lie in the intervals where the blue graph is above green one.
Remember: the boundaries of these intervals can be points at which both sides are equal, that is, where the graphs intersect, but also points where one of the functions is not defined or discontinuous.
And now you can see what went wrong: when we tried to solve the inequality, we found the x-values where the graphs intersect, but we forgot that the left hand side is not defined at two points on the real line.
That really matters here: you see that at these points, the inequality holds on one side, but not on the other.
You can see this clearly in the graph.
We relied on the graph here.
Sometimes sketching the graph is not an option, because it is too difficult.

[Music] Hi, Welcome to Wave Domain
My name is Andi and today what I wanted to do was a one-minute video on averages vs medians
Now, I refer to both of these terms quite a lot when i'm doing the trend analysis and looking at the sales data so i thought it would be good good idea to make sure that we're on the same page with what this means
Averages - very simple - take the total sales and divide by the count and that gives you a number that is the average
Now, medians are a little bit more democratic
Cos what you're gonna do is you're going to line up all the sales in ascending order and go to that one that the halfway point and that's going to be your median
Now they are much less skewed, medians, are much less skewed by really giant sales at the top end and so that sometimes is a much better indicator of what you might expect to get for one of your names on a typical sale
Averages are very useful indicators but you tend to get blown around by those higher numbers at the top end
So that's my 52 second definition of averages vs medians
Thanks for watching Wave Domain
We're going to continue our series on what every domainer needs to know addition our sales-data driven approach to reporting on auction sites, extensions, name types, what to buy, where to buy, where to sell it all things sales-data related

hello there its Ruth Sherman CEO and celebrity speech and media coach but you don't have to be famous to work with me I had to go into new york city for an event last night
It was something I was really looking forward to
Anyway a I drove in which was kinda dumb because as you may know the Super Bowl is taking place and and New York has pretty much set aside Times Square, which is right where the meeting was to have been
This big picture events this big fun event that has bands in and so forth are celebrating the Super Bowl so I got to New York
It took me an extra 45 minutes


usually takes me 45 minutes so it took me twice as long to get there I parked the car in a garage near the event, struggled with the traffic
I know I know I should have taken public transportation
And then I got to the a venue where the event was supposed to be and found out to my chagrin that the event had been moved had not received a notice so I was not a happy camper
Now if you know anything about new york you know that I had to then retrieve my car driver all the way downtown was all the way at the bottom of Manhattan from Time Square it would take me another hour and by that time the event would have been about three quarters over so I decided to just get in the car and go home so and because I was feeling like the you know ugh
I was feeling worse than that
But when I got to the garage who should be standing there next to me waiting for his car but the amazing and gifted genius Steven Spielberg now even II have a hard time not staring and of course I know being in the celebrity world that you really wanna give these people some space nobody else was approaching him
I certainly wasn't going to go up to him and say anything
I didn't want to intrude on his valuable private space, yes, these people just want to be treated like regular human beings even though they're not
But what got me thinking on my way home instead of being angry it got me thinking about his genius of storytelling
nobody spins a yarn like Steven Spielberg
and although I recently did a video on storytelling because I get a lot of questions about how many times do I tell the same story, it occurred to me how many times I have seen Steven Spielberg's movies Jurassic Park
I've seen all three of them at least 10 times each, probably much more
Lost count to be honest with you along with The Color Purple and and Schindler's List so I have seen these movies so many times I know what's going to happen in these movies, I know the outcome, I know when to hide my eyes, I know when I know when it's going to be funny, but I still love seeing them
I love going on the journey with them with him
And this is what happens when you tell the same story over and over again provided it's a good one

it's got to be good
All right so people who have heard your story before also want to relive it

The real estate market is filling up with more and more options for home buyers as sellers continue to jump back in
Many are as eager to sell as Carolyn Burnham in American Beauty
I will sell this house today Even with the greater supply, the reality is that it's still a buyers market
Informed home buyers can find unbelievable deals on mortgages
You can look at at interest rates around 3

What that really means is that home buyers can afford more house than they would a year from now
But how do you lock down such great rates? It's not as simple as just asking for it
Real estate expert Geri Willis explains on Howdini

You should really put down 20% because that is going to give you skin in the game
This means you can afford this house, lenders are going to take you more seriously and they are going to give you the best terms
But don't get ahead of yourself
The first step is finding the right house
And even though many home buyers think that buying a brand-new house is as simple as picking up a loaf of bread, that's hardly the case
You absolutely should have your own buyer's agent and here's why
The seller, the developer is basically protecting their interest
You're excited and you want to buy this new home
You look at the model and they give you this contract
You have nobody representing yourself as a fiduciary
But, most importantly, where do you even begin your search? Geri Willis is back again with the answer and, here's a hint

I'm Shawn Murphy, I'm a graduate from Sociology program at Trent University Durham, the former president of the Trent Durham Student Association.
The year prior to that I was vice president of University Affairs.
Second year I decided to get involved as possible and I joined the Board of Directors becoming the Director for Sociology.
I attended many of the Black History Month events, I actually got to present some of my research at two of them.
Some of the major benefits of getting involved, I definitely noticed, well, first of all I got to meet a lot of great people I got to really develop a lot of skills that I wouldn't have been able to otherwise.
It's not too often that someone in their early twenties is able to look over an entire company's budget.
Just decisions like that, those are crucial and they look great on resumes.
Beyond that, I actually excelled academically from some of my decisions.
The second I started getting more involved my grades skyrocketed.
Just make sure that you're on campus more the longer you're on campus it's statistically shown that your grades are going to increase so getting involved is beneficial across the board for students I think.
Trent University Durham, I'm pretty sure every bit of marketing for you says it's a tight-knit community and the fact that's like an ongoing trend, ongoing response means it's true.
I've watched as all of you have gotten fatter and dumber

I did my placement at Brtish Sugar, who are the UK leader in the sugar industry.
What I actually did was work in an operations environment, so I was kind of involved in the day-to-day running of the factory and any projects that they wanted to kind of put forward to our board of directors, they'd try and get me involved with those as much as they could.
I was working with a whole range of different people so anyone from the Health and Safety Department, all the way up to the factory manager.
I had a chance to get involved with some board meetings as well so - yeah - a really broad spectrum of opportunities.
What we basically did was put together a project plan for a new product called Activated Carbon.
It's new to the sugar industry and hasn't been used anywhere else in the world for that kind of application.
So we put together a project plan, did some experiments in the lab, put together funding and a project brief, presented that to our board of directors and I found out last week that the funding's been approved which is a great personal success for me and I'll look back on that with pride.
My placement, really I thought would be a lot more engineering-based.
Really what I got out of it mostly was kind of contract management, time management, how to deal with kind of different departments within the company.
and a lot of her fieldwork involved going into communities in the South and in the Caribbean to record local songs and stories
And she placed a value in how people expressed themselves — the humor, the inventiveness, the liveliness of language — and her work can be read as a tribute to that
But the different kinds of speech are also, as the scholar Henry Louis Gates points out, a way of acknowledging that there is often a gap between what characters think and how they express themselves
As Gates writes, “[Hurston’s] is a rhetoric of division, rather than a fiction of psychological or cultural unity
” Still, just because the words the characters use are simple, and sometimes misunderstood, that doesn’t mean that there isn’t a great depth of feeling behind them

When meeting with deaf or hearing-impaired people, what are the considerations?
Make sure the meeting place is quiet and has good lighting.
Round table seating arrangement is best.
Background noises should be kept at a minimum.
If there is noise, stop talking until it passes.
Lighting should be above or in front of, but not behind the speaker.
Give the agenda of the meeting to a deaf or hearing-impaired person in advance.
If you have a minute-taker, seat the deaf or hearing-impaired person next to him or her.
When showing audio-visual recordings, ensure that they have captions available that make sense, or provide written transcripts.
Ensure that everyone knows that a deaf or hearing-impaired person is present.
Explain the rules of speaking as follows: One, only have one speaker speaking at a time.
Two, raise your hand before speaking.

Hey everyone, what's up I'm Pat and I'm reviewing the movie Club Dread
Club Dread I mean, it was pretty much a huge disappointment
Still kind of funny (uhh) but if you, if you've (stutter) heard of the movie Super Troopers (uhh) basically it has the exact same cast as that movie
(uhh) This movie (uhh) is the same same (stutter) people
It's supposed to be kind of like a Super Troopers two, except having nothing to do with that movie
It's you know the next in line of that comedy team, The Broken Lizard
But (umm) I mean it it's it's it's (stutter) an okay movie, it's kinda funny
(uhh) But I mean, the thing is to compare it to Super Troopers, which you're supposed to it's it's (stutter) there's no comparison
Super Troopers is just much better
(uhh) This movie just it was kind of kind of a disappointment
I don't even know really why I, I (stutter) bought it because I hadn't seen it in theaters and I knew who was in it so I was like, it's gotta be good
Meh (uhh) I'd stick to Super Troopers if I were you
If you have that movie in your library, watch that and then just assume that this movie's okay
This is (umm) The Python, the movie The Python and (uhh) it's a story about (umm) a doctor, really like a mad scientist, who (umm) develops (uhh) the perfect killing machine and it's (uhh) a python
Engineered the perfect killing machine, the world's first massive genetically enhanced python, and the actors are, let's see (uhh) Jerry McCarthy, Will Wheaton, (uhh) Frayne Rosanoff, Casper (stutter) Van Dien, and Robert Englund
Anyway (umm) if you like snake movies then you'll this
If you like the Anaconda and all those other snake movies you'll like this
If you don't like snakes, you will not like this
And (uhh) let's see
this particular DVD has outtakes, (uhh) still gallery on pythons, (uhh) biographies on the cast and director, trailers, (uhh) the the English and Spanish subtitles, so (umm), you know I didn't care for it
I mean I don't know if you can see the picture on this but (stutter) that python's got some huge fangs and (umm) so if you like snake movies, you would like this
If not, I'd skip this
Oh, you can get this at Amazon dot com or rent it from (umm) Blockbuster
Hey, how you doing? My name is Roger
I want to tell you (stutter) a little bit about this movie called The Karate Kid III
Okay? Yes, that's right, part III
They have continued making these sequels to The Karate Kid
Now, the first movie was great
It had (umm) Pat Marita and Ralph Macchio, and it was Daniel-san and his sensei, Myagi, and it was about how they first met, how they (umm) fought, (umm) I mean, how he taught him how, Myagi taught Daniel how to do karate
The second one was, you know, took it down the next road, where they went to, back to (umm) Okinawa and, you know, (umm) Myagi, they got hooked up in some kind of feud
Well, the third one here (umm) with the same characters, which is good because it has the same exact characters, it just keeps going on and on, (umm) it talks about this feud
Now Myagi and Daniel are kind of on opposite ends
(umm) Daniel wants Myagi to help him get ready for a tournament and (umm) Myagi doesn't want to do it
So it's it's (stutter) about them being on opposite ends
And the guy who Daniel ended up going to is an old nemesis of Myagi's, and so you got that drama there
Okay? But it's just it's just (stutter) not as good as the originals
(umm) the original Karate Kid
But I'll tell you, I mean, if you're watching them, you might as well go ahead and see the, you know, all of the Karate Kids as they go into it
But it is (umm) you know, it does star the same people
It is rated PG because it's dealing with fighting and karate and things like that
But it's it's it's (stutter) worth just taking a look if there's no other thing out there to watch and you've, you (stutter) get the whole set
Okay? Just so you can kind of see it
But, like I said, the farther down you go on the sequels, they don't quite get as good as the first one was
But (uhh) The Karate Kid III, starring, (umm) you know, Ralph Macchio and Pat Marita, (umm) go take a look at it if you wanted to move, keep on moving down The Karate Kid road
Okay
Saving Private Ryan
This movie rules
(umm) It's won so many awards, it was the best grossing (uhh) highest actually, highest grossing film of ninety-eight
(uhh) It's two hours and forty-nine minutes long, and (uhh) it's pretty much on every top hundred list in the world for movies
(umm) Steven Spielberg won a ton of like, (uhh) highest honors from the army and stuff like that too, that that's (stutter) how good this movie was, like it was very realistic and it told from the perspective of a soldier
So it starts off (umm) with the invasion of Normandy
And the problem is (umm) Private Ryan has three brothers in the war as well and they all die
And so Tom Hanks is the main character and his goal to the entire thing is to find Private Ryan and bring him back to his mom so that she doesn't lose four sons
(umm) And they, and (stutter) embark on the epic journey where they're trying to decide why are we trying to save this one guy, it's it's (stutter) a war, like people die
Why are we saving one guy and there's eight of us risking our lives for this one guy
And so the whole story takes place them trying to decide that for themselves as they go and find him
And Matt Damon plays Private Ryan
And (uhh) overall I'd say it's a great movie, it definitely entertaining even though it's long
It, you won't, you won't (stutter) fall asleep in this one
Wanted to review this movie Washington Square
(uhh) It stars (uhh) Ben Chaplin and Jennifer Leigh
And it's a story that takes place in the eighteen hundreds in New York
And you have an (uhh), let's see upper class (umm) doctor and (uhh) and his homely daughter and (uhh) (stutter) you have this charming (uhh) guy that comes along, played by Ben Chapling, Chaplin, who is (umm) you don't know if he really loves the homely daughter or if he's out for her money and so that's the plot of the story
And (umm) it's really a boring story
I think the story (stutter) I think the movie is like an hour and fifty-five minutes but the whole, the whole time (stutter) you're waiting to, and you're waiting (stutter) and thinking that something's going to happen that's going to make the show interesting and before you know it the show is over with and that exciting thing never did happen
So (umm), you know, I found it boring and I would probably give it, you know, maybe a three out of five rating
(uhh) But you can get, you know, you can get Washington Square at Amazon dot com or you can borrow it and rent it
Some people may like it because (umm) it's in the eighteen-hundreds, maybe mid eighteen-hundreds to late eighteen-hundreds and so (umm) it's interesting watching the social life of that era
That was, that was (stutter) really interesting
And so for that reason some some (stutter) people may to want to watch it just to see the, you know, the social life of that era
But other than that I really didn't care for it

Well, two things that I should report on today: Before we came here one of the issues that we had,  was this issue called the 'decision-making mechanism'. What that was doing was looking at what kind criteria there might need to be in order for there to be a future trade in ivory.
Today I'm reviewing Snakes On A Plane
(uhh) Pretty funny movie, (uhh) pretty corny movie actually
(umm) I'm very surprised that a actor notorious as Samuel L
Jackson would agree to do a movie quite like this
(uhh) I guess you know money's money so if you get paid for this movie you get paid for something else and you don't really have to try to act too hard in this movie
(uhh) Basically starts out, a guy witnesses a murder
Samuel L
Jackson's an FBI agent, gonna protect him
(uhh) And then they get on a plane and the (uhh) the mobsters try to put snakes on a plane to kill everybody
Is basically how the movie you know, starts out
(uhh) Personally I thought it was pretty (uhh) it was just really corny, and I mean it's kind of interesting to see what they could possibly do with snakes on a plane
(uhh) I could see like maybe like attack eagles on a plane, because you know, eagles fly and planes fly but like snakes on planes you just, it's a concept that's really out there
(uhh) And then the snakes, it's just, it's kind of a more low budget film, the CG snakes, computer generated so they're not very realistic
&gt;&gt; Hi this is Bill Baldwin.
I'm answering the question should businessmen have a code of ethics that they have to answer to.
I'm wondering whether any dishonest executive would be made more honest by having a code.
Today, I'm reviewing Event Horizon
This is the (uhh) the special collector's edition
It stars (uhh) Laurence Fishburne, Kevin Costner, and (uhh) also Joely Richardson, who is (uhh) the who stars in (uhh) Nip Tuck, which is a great show
(uhh) Event Horizon it's a really cool concept actually event horizon's actually (uhh) the point in space in which you can't get sucked or which outside of you cannot get sucked in to a black hole
So it's basically the (uhh) the furtherest extent of a black hole
It's kind of a sphere
(umm) So it's a really cool concept in terms of the (uhh) the science behind it and then, you know, what happens if you were to get closer
(uhh) But it's just, it's just (stutter) a really gross movie
It's one of those movies that like it's scary movie, too
(umm) But it's real gross
There's just nasty blood and guts and disgusting things hanging out all over this spaceship that basically goes to an alternate dimension, or hell, and then comes back and then these people go and try to rescue it because they think it's been a long lost (uhh) spaceship
(umm) So, I wouldn't really (stutter) recommend this movie
I don't think it was very good
Hey, how you doing? My name is Roger
I want to tell you a little bit about this (uhh) movie called the Master of Disguise
Now I will you that this is probably one of the biggest wastes of ninety minutes that I've ever done in my life
This is one of the most stupidest movies, (umm) and it was a complete (umm) insult for me to even watch it
It was that dumb
So I will tell you don't bother
If you see it keep walking by
Now Dana Carvey, I mean he's the, you know (stutter) it's, he's the main guy in the movie
Now I I (stutter) used to watch him on Saturday Night Live and, you know, it was funny
But in this movie he's a detective and he's in all, he goes in all kinds of different disguises to to to (stutter) do (umm) to to to (stutter) go after the bad guy, I can't remember exactly, I don't even remember why he's going after him
I just remember it was just so ridiculously stupid
(umm) I mean there's some stupid funny movies out there but this (umm) I mean it it (stutter) you had to have the maturity of maybe a five year old to really, really think this is a funny movie
So I will tell you Dana Carvey's Master of Disguise, if you see it just keep right on going
It's not worth the ten dollars, it's not worth the five dollars
If someone gives you the movie it's not worth the time to even watch it
So don't even think about it, don't look at the name of it except the fact of saying ooh never get that movie
Hi, I'm here with The Matrix Revolutions
This is the final movie in the Matrix Trilogy
I'm giving this movie a two out of five
I love the first Matrix, the second Matrix had amazing action and special effects and I liked it too
However I did not like this third movie
I felt they could have ended the trilogy so much better
Almost the entire movie was like (stutter) two battles
One in the real world and one in the matrix and it (stutter) didn't feel like that much happened in this movie
The movie just felt like really short and (stutter) the ending just wasn't that good
The dialogue was pretty bad
Keanu Reeves Keanu Reaves' acting was like a lot worse than the first two movies
He has a lot of one-liners and he's confused a lot of the movie
(uhh) {clears throat} He (stutter) doesn't show a lot of emotion
(uhh) There's this one fight with Neo and Agent Smith that like (stutter) there was like a billion Agent Smiths but he only fought one so it was kind of disappointing cause I I (stutter) thought it would be a crazy fight with every Agent Smith against Neo, but no, it was just one
(umm) And that fight was kind of disappointing
It was basically a rip-off of Dragon Ball Z
(umm) The DVD has some extra features, some behind the scenes stuff but I don't think that makes it worth buying
I will now be reviewing Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie For Theaters
(umm) Let me first off start by saying that I absolutely hate the show Aqua Teen
I think it's horrible
I've never been able to watch a full episode, when I do I'm just kind of like (uhh) that's what I'm like
So I didn't want to go to see this movie but somebody paid for my movie ticket, so I went
And I expected to fall asleep but I did not
The beginning of the movie starts out with this little dancing, these little dancing (stutter) food people
And that part was probably the most hilarious part of the movie
In my opinion
So if anything go to see that
If you like the show you'll like the movie
If you don't like the show, you will not like this movie but you won't dislike it as much as you like the show
I could have about halfway in the movie it's like I, I (stutter) think I'd seen enough
{noise} I wanted to leave
Whoops sorry
I wanted to leave but I couldn't because I was there with a friend and she would not leave and she paid for my ticket so how could I really leave
(umm) I really have no further comment on this movie because I zoned out for most of it
So I would just say that (uhh) do not see it {laugh} if you don't like the show
That's my, my (stutter) advice for you guys
If you like the show see it though
COURTNEY KELSO: For us, the ability to work very, very closely and in collaboration with artists.
It's not about for us, and I hope that this is a trend that is coming out.
We begin the poem with what's traditionally referred to as the prologue.
And this beginning of the poem doesn't start with Beowulf, it starts with other kings prior to him.
Primarily it references a king named Scyld, and Scyld is held out to be a great king, or the example of what kingship is and why is he an example of kingship?
Hi, I am Frank and today’s topic is “Microsoft MB2-707 exam and its preparation” first of all I will discuss about MB2-707 exam related skills and technologies.
Afterwards I will share my personal experience how you can reduce your chances of failure in Microsoft MB2-707 exam which is related to “Microsoft Dynamics CRM” and credits towards “Microsoft Specialist” Certification.
Let’s get started This exam validates the ability to identify documents in the Microsoft Dynamics CRM implementation guide, Create entity relationships, map fields, manage connections and connection roles, work with relationship hierarchy visualization.
It also deals with the ability to Identify scenarios where multiple forms are useful, specify form order, assign roles to forms and describe considerations when designing mobile forms.
This exam is intended for individuals who plan to customize and configure Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2015. This audience typically includes implementation consultants, technical support and system administrators.
JASON KATCHER: Some education marketers can safely take risk these days, mainly due in part to the transparency and accountability that digital marketing allows them.
In other traditional forms of advertising, you aren't able to close the loop as quickly as you would like to, meaning that when you run a television spot, or a radio spot, or a newspaper ad, it's extremely difficult to tie that back very quickly to what the actual result is.
It usually takes days, or weeks, or months in some cases to go back and look at that information.
Joining us now is our Political Director John Dickerson who is in Charlotte tonight John, Obama officials have had a tough time answering the question are you better off than you were four years ago, how big a problem is that for them as they head into this convention?
Well, it's essential obstacle of this convention they can't say things are better off because people don't feel like they're better off, so what the field campaign has tried to do is change the question from "do you feel like things are better?" to "will things be better?" Well that's a tough thing to do in the campaign in part because it makes voters think you might be trying to fool them.
Meanwhile John, the Obama campaign will try to lean at least a little bit here on  Bill Clinton at this convention.
We have identified many brands.
I cannot give you the whole list, but there are many brands who are doing it right.
And I’ll give you examples I give in the conference.
an all too real institution in the societies that we've been exploring of ancient Greece and ancient Rome
And so by looking at the way that the philosophers of the ancient world treat slavery, we can gain insights into the meaning and the limits of justice
Now before we explore the meaning of slavery for the ancient thinkers of justice, we must recognize one fundamental difference between ancient and modern slavery, and that is the concept of race
Ancient and modern slavery are more alike than many people often recognize, but there is this true, genuine, fundamental difference that ancient slavery is not race-based

Do you need to drive more conversions?
The next thing I'm going to talk to you about is arm positioning.
Later on when you know the dance well, you can take the arms and make it uniquely yours.
Until then when you're first learning, you may want to start with your hands on your hips here, so you can concentrate just on the moves and not have to worry about your hands.
This is an easy way to just keep them up and raised and bent and not have to worry about them.
The device in someone’s pocket is a very personal experience and it’s a very-- sometimes I’ll even say it’s an intimate experience.
And so I think it requires a special level of delicacy from the brands that want to use that connection point to achieve some goal with the consumer.
AMBASSADOR JEFFREY BLEICH: Hi, I'm Jeff Bleich, the United States ambassador to Australia.
Welcome to the US Embassy.
I've been here for two years now with my family, and we've had a chance to travel all over Australia.
I've been to every state and territory, out to regional Australia, and also to all the major capitals, several times now.
And the one thing that this has confirmed for us is that we truly have no better friend in the world than Australia.
We are working on every major issue today, including making sure that we have free trade in the region and strengthen both of our economies.
Making sure that the sea channels are free and safe.
Making sure that the risks to our nations, either from climate change or from nuclear proliferation, are reduced, and that we work together on every possible challenge, not only in the spirit of protecting ourselves and promoting ourselves, but also for making it a better world.

Many people have been asking if I'll kneel on the ground or not, but first of all, you should understand that I'll never do so, as I don' t think HD-DVD was defeated at all.
Only filmmakers left from us without apology, so we suspend development.
By the way, though who ask me to kneel on the ground, do they earn money than I?
I can't response for lowly people, who are not satisfied with TOSHIBA.
I don't answer for those ridiculous guys who got laid off, NEET people and BBS writers.
So go back to the back pain, again, the reason my reference is back pain is because in an orthopedic setting, I would say 40% of my caseload is patients with back pain, right? So, they actually did a study and found that 16 days seems to be this, like, magic cutoff
For whatever reason, if we were able to see patients within 16 days, seeing them before that time they do better, but if we see them after that time the risk of chronic pain is actually increased
Now why that is is still hard to be understood but there's definitely some things to be said about seeing patients early when they have back pain rather than late
So, the typical model is: our back hurts so we wait it out for 5, 7, 10 days perhaps
It gets to be bad enough that we go see our Physician
Our Physician then gives us, perhaps, some medications and says, you know, rest and take it easy
Well two weeks go by of taking it easy
Our pain isn't any better
All the sudden we've lost four, maybe six, weeks and then you see your Physician again and they send you to Physical Therapy
We've already lost that magic window of 16 days in which most patients are going to improve
Now in order to be the most efficient and effective in responding to your messages that come in via email, there's two things that you need to do.

Did you know that only 4% of sellers are getting connected to their real estate agent through websites, as a cold lead, means they didn't know you before.
And it's only 10% of buyers.

Hi, in this video we are going to take a look at one of the most important activities in New Eden: Manufacturing.
All manufacturing starts with blueprints,  which can be bought on the market or through contracts.
Be sure to watch the Flight Academy tutorial  on blueprints for more information.
As an example, let’s manufacture a Rifter, one of the most iconic and accessible ships in the game.
Once you have a blueprint for a Rifter, you will need to find a location capable of manufacturing it.
The easiest way to do this is to open  the Industry window and select the Facilities tab.
You can then filter to find a facility which is accessible to you.
In this case we will look for a public facility  which can handle manufacturing.
Using different facilities will cost different amounts of ISK, based on the tax rate set by their owners and the Industry System Index.
The Industry System Index is determined by  the amount of industrial activity taking place in the system.
For example, if there is a lot of manufacturing going on, then you will be charged more  for manufacturing in that system.
Once you have decided on a facility,  you will need to move your blueprint there.
But you will need more than just a blueprint to manufacture.
Each blueprint will list what materials and skills  are required in the Show Info window.
However, it’s often easier to right click and select ‘Use Blueprint’. This will show the blueprint in the Industry window and show what is needed and how much it costs.
Remember, you do not need to own a Blueprint  in order to view it in the Industry Window.
Tooltips are available in each section.
For instance, if you hover your mouse over the Job Duration time you can see everything that affects how long your job will take.
You can see that the duration of the job is reduced by skills, implants and even by what facility you use.
To the left of the window you will see the materials required.
If you hover over any of the materials you will see the amount you have available at the facility  compared to the amount the job will use.
According to a new study by KPMG, the United States has the most innovative building and infrastructure projects.
A total of 14 projects in the US were cited as leaders in the infrastructure and city construction industry.
In this section we're going to be discussing a model known as 123s of customer service.
I'm Pamela Unruh with Expert Village.
Let's talk a little bit more specifically about the two types of questions that you can ask your customer.
Now I mentioned closed end questions now closed end questions are used again just to get very specific very short answers.
Your basically going to use a closed ended question to continue to control the conversation and keep it focused.
We're still talking about presentation, and something that we want to take a look at when we're evaluating a speaker is their face.
Not what their face looks like but what they do with their face.
First of all, eye contact.
Is the speaker not looking at the audience?
Are they perhaps focusing the entire speech on their notes?
It's an outlined speech, but yet they're never taking their eyes off the outline.
Are they looking at one particular person through the entire speech and never looking at the rest of the audience?
Or, are they looking around at everyone in the audience, which is what they should be doing?
Hi there, today I have a very special announcement namely, I'll be attending the Origami USA convention this year, It's going to take place at Manhattan College in Riverdale, NY from June 19 to June 22, 2015 and I'm super, super excited It's extra special because it's the first convention that I'll be attending outside of Europe so I look forward to seeing a lot of people that I haven't met before perhaps you, too and something special too about this convention is that I will be a special guest so I was invited which is a huge, huge honor for me and I'll be teaching lots of workshops and I'll also be joined by Hoang Tien Quyet as the other special guest and he's such an awesome artist I really look forward to meeting him too If you don't know his work yet, he has a Flickr stream and he also has a new YouTube channel so do check that out He has a very artistic way of designing models and it's absolutely gorgeous and beautiful So that's really nice, too
Hi
This is Dan with my review of Groundhog Day by (stutter) Bill Murray
This is one of my favorite movies
So I would give this a (stutter) enthusiastic five out of five rating
(umm) Groundhog Day is rated PG for (umm) some suggestive scenes and materials, but this is a very funny movie in that it is well-played by Bill Murray and well-written (umm) by far
Groundhog Day (umm) being (ahh) that day in spring in which the groundhog comes out of its hibernation, checks and looks for its shadow
And if he sees it, then we have X more weeks of winter left, something like that
(umm) Billy Murray and his crew, his news crew, are sent to cover (umm) the (umm) emergence of Punxsutawney Phil, yup, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, (uhh) the (stutter) groundhog famous for coming out and looking for its shadow
But what Bill Murray finds out is that he is somehow trapped in this day
He wakes up
He replays the day over, as if nothing the day before had happened
And, you know, he lives this day over and over and over again
At first, he enjoys it, from robbing banks to doing whatever he wishes, (uhh) until he finally realizes that he's stuck in this little timewarp and even tries to drive off a cliff to kill himself, only to wake up to that same alarm that's been going off day after day after day
The mystery is how he is going to break out of this loop, and that's the fun of the movie
Groundhog Day is a fun one, good for dates, good for significant others
It's, to some degree, a chick flick (uhh) which is, which is (stutter) fun
But you'll also get a good laugh out of it (umm) in addition to the romance and the drama that does evolve in it
DAVID BELL: Certainly we want to see what's going on, in terms of these conversations, but maybe we want to participate.
But there's also the notion of do I participate in kind of an honest and a real way, or do I participate in a more subversive kind of way.
The danger is if the firm intervenes in the process, if it does it in a way that's too transparent, and people see the firm as an outsider, I think this could be problematic.
If you are running for office, or plan to someday, you will encounter four difficult pressure points in your campaign: the press, interest groups, donors, and voters.
How you respond to those pressure points is often the difference between victory and defeat.
In a minute I’ll tell you why.
The Press is constantly badgering candidates to talk about things that are important to the media, but not necessary the voters.
Which is why we often see candidates being asked about global warming even though very few voters say it is their top concern.
The press will also badger you about things you’d rather not discuss, like when you plan to release your tax returns.
If you let reporters throw you off message voters will never hear your message.
Likewise, important interest groups expect candidates to toe the line on their agenda, and are quick to howl when candidates don’t.
Need proof?
Look at the howling from elements of the conservative religious community about Donald Trump.
Or imagine how unionized teachers would react if Hillary Clinton said something nice about charter schools.
Don’t hold your breath on that one.
Donors exert pressure.
They invest money to buy access and influence, or because of deeply held beliefs.
Donald Trump is seeing that first hand now.
Despite his promise to self fund, he now says he can’t foot the bill for a billion dollar campaign.
You have recently incorporated your business and you are coming in contact with many terms and phrases that you were not previously familiar with.
One of these phrases is the board of directors.
Hi
This is my review of the movie Music and Lyrics
(umm) I rented this the other day from Blockbuster and (umm) my mom described this movie as cheesy to me and basically I would say that sums the movie up like cheesy
It's just one of those really cheesy movies (umm) basically (umm) Hugh Grant is this former like eighties pop star who was really popular in the eighties and (umm) they start doing some battle of the (uhh) like battle of the not bands but that kind of deal, battle of the pop stars from the eighties (umm) to kinda bring back some of the eighties stars and (umm) I guess in the process of that, this like, current (umm) like a Britney Spears or (umm) (umm) that type of person basically (umm) is wanting Hugh Grant to write a song for her (umm) she actually has several like husband artists (umm) kind of competing to write a song for her and so (umm) the only problem is that Hugh Grant is while he's a good singer and everything, he's not the one who always wrote the lyrics to the song, he had someone else in his band do that (umm) but the band, like he's not in speaking terms with the guy who normally write these lyrics so now he's in trouble because he can't write lyrics
(umm) And then enter Drew Barrymore, his (umm) actually apparently, this plant lady, she is hired to take care of his plants (umm) and so she, just happens to be this really awesome writer, she had written children's story or something like that and so, she (umm) writes, helps him write this song and (umm) of course (uhh) pop star, the current pop star loves it and so, she uses it and blah blah blah and it's just really really cheesy
And of course because, you know, like all cheesy movies, these two fall in love, Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant fall in love and it's just a cheesy cheesy movie
I really don't recommend it unless you're just looking for a way to waste an hour and a half and then you know , you might like it but (umm) I was pretty disappointed in it, at least I knew going into it was going to be pretty cheesy because my mom had warned me so yeah I wasn't like oh really disappointed but still
(umm) So I would give this movie two out of five stars

FRANK RIJSBERMAN: You might expect nothing else from a Googler, but we feel that opening up data has a big transformative effect on social action.
There are a lot of groups working on transparency, which is sort of code word for anti-corruption, making government more transparent.
And a lot is about basically making date more transparent.
Groups for instance, NGOs that made government budgets more transparent.

In this video lesson, I‘m going to give you some phrases so you can introduce yourself, make small talk at conferences and do the hard-sell of networking
When we meet someone for the first time, we can introduce ourselves like this: Hello, my name‘s John, pleased to meet you
Or: I‘m John, nice to meet you
You can answer with the following expressions: Hello, I‘m Steve
Nice to meet you too

DAMON PHILLIPS: You know there's strong interest in online programming, especially live long-form content.
And we're very bullish on what ESPN360 can do from an ad sales standpoint.
the first question is why do you want to evaluate personality
Because I haven't seen a personality test yet that can tell you whether you should hire or not hire a person
Okay, so it's not a tool to be used to make a decision
What personality evaluation is a tool to go what more or what more new information can I get out of this person to make a final decision and know how I can manage them better
And so really, the question is then like, what is personality
And so there is two sides
We have the production potential of a person, this is measured with what we called our Production Check Evaluation
Hi I'm Carl Kwan.
This is Part 1 in a four part series on presentation design using CRAP.
In this video you'll learn about contrast.
Contrast, by definition, is an obvious difference between objects.
Contrast in your presentation slides is important because it helps your audience identify what is important on your slides and what is less important.
It's a process that happens naturally because the human brain processes larger things as more significant and smaller things as less significant.
When it comes to presentations, the easiest way to apply contrast is in your presentation text.
Let's have a look at an example.
As you can see, the text is the same size with no contrast whatsoever.
Your job as the presenter is to help the audience quickly understand what is important to them and not to make them guess.
So here is contrast applied to the most important content on the slide.
One experience that will stay with me through my law career is my 1L summer internship with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
During my first week there I was asked to produce a memo to basically decide if the agency was going to pursue a certain case or not.
We also know that gender equality is absolutely critical for, as what the World Bank says, smart economics.
There is an annual report that the World Economic Forum puts out that shows, in countries where men and women are more equal, where the gap is closed on key indicators, including economic participation, that those countries are far more economically competitive and prosperous and there is a wealth of data that shows that as women take their place in the workforce, the enhancement to economic productivity grows rather exponentially.
We also know that women invest their incomes in far greater numbers, upwards to ninety percent, in education and health for their children and into the wider community.
G'day, my name is Rod Sherwin from Tap4Health.
Welcome to another EFT Advanced Approaches video.
The basic EFT set up statement is 'Even though I have this issue' - is the first part, focussing on whatever the issue is you want to focus on - and the second bit, 'I deeply and completely accept myself' or 'I deeply and profoundly accept myself'. Now, sometimes we're okay saying that negative stuff but when we get to the 'I deeply and completely accept myself' you go, "Oh no, I don't.
That's crap.
I don't believe that at all!" So what can you say when you don't deeply and completely accept yourself?
What can you do?
The curious thing is there's been some research done by some other Australians, David Lake and Stephen Wells, that shows it works just as well if you don't say 'I deeply and completely accept myself' and if you just focus on the issue.
So you may want to tap on just, "Feeling upset about that fight with my spouse," "Feeling upset about that fight with my spouse." Just focus on what the issue is.
They did one test which is just remarkable where they changed that second part to 'I completely reject myself' and it still worked.
So it's all about what you focus on while you tap.
It is good to be able to say something positive after you're focusing on the negative.
The reason we focus on the negative is so that your energy system is tuned in to the issue that you want to deal with.

this is a quick video to show you how to do the pie chart that's going to work on your profit and loss spreadsheet assignment and pie chart is going to be the components of revenue Revenue is ALL the money that comes into the business Now we want to see all the expenses where it goes That is cost of good sold like the meat for hamburger and salaries and the interest, advertising, Christmas party, Uncle Sam for taxes and then Net Income to shareholders This is how we do it will add slices - numbers and labels on non-contiguous, not touching cells we Step 1, start by clicking on the first cell value of cost of goods sold and then down my control key or I'm on a Mac so it's called a command key and I click on each of these non operating, also known as discretionary expense since I can spend or not 1, 2 3 then I click on taxes which is the money I have to send to Uncle Sam and this is the money that left for dividends or reinvested in the business for shareholders
finally I highlight those labels still holding down the Ctrl Cost of Good sold, advertising, Christmas party, taxes and income Then I let go of the Ctrl key I go to my pie chart My pictures are different on a Mac I choose a 3D pie and there they are The various components: cost of goods sold advertising, Christmas party taxes, net income
If I wish to explode one of them for example, I'm feeling very badly that taxes I will click taxes
I will kick on it again so that the dots are just here
we can think about the treated people as a particular subset of people, the people who were treated
And we can define the average treatment effect for those people
So the average treatment on the treated, ATT, is just going to be the average unit causal effects for the people who are treated
So this person, this person, this person, that's 20 plus five, plus five and then this person here, this one female who is treated plus five divided by four people

AND THE DESIRES TEND TO DIMINISH, AS WELL, AND YOU TYPICALLY DO NOT HAVE TO ADD OTHER TYPE OF MEDICATIONS, ANTIDEPRESSANTS, AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE
AS FAR AS THERAPY, THAT WOULD BE UP TO THE FAMILY
YOU KNOW, IT MAY BE BENEFICIAL TO THE FAMILY TO WORK TOGETHER IN A THERAPY-TYPE SITUATION IN ORDER TO BETTER DEAL WITH PARKINSON'S IN ITSELF AS WELL AS THE IMPULSE CONTROL DISORDER
- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS TO BE ABLE TO FEEL LIKE THEY CAN TALK TO THE DOCTOR AND NURSE ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS WITH THE MEDICATIONS AND PARTICULARLY WITH THIS DOPAMINE AGONIST
I just felt that they were grinding down the American system to a powder, quite frankly, and I just wasn’t going to cooperate with them.
"Hello this is Matthew Burbank". Hello my name is Matthew Burbank and I'm an Associate Professor at the University of Utah and I'd like to talk to you a little bit about how to start a petition to get legislation on a ballot.
The first thing you want to recognize is that this depends on the state that you live in.
So in many states, you can indeed petition to have legislation considered directly by a vote.
In other state, it's not possible to do this.
About 20－thousand nurses from more than one－hundred－30 countries are gathered in Seoul for this year′s International Council of Nurses Conference.
While the main theme of the conference will be the global nursing community joining efforts to ensure health and safety around the world， it should be interesting to see what speakers like the WHO Director－General Margaret Chan will have to say about the MERS outbreak in Korea.
Hi it’s Bobby again, I thought I would just mention something about the Professorial lectures and the way that they can inform your understanding of your subject in a different way than the understanding you get from your degree subject.
So for me, personally, I've really enjoyed the lectures organised by Professor Ronald Dworkin so far.
are you talking about yourself, and what you're doing, and why it's so awesome for you
Or are you telling the story of your channel that's actually about other people, and what you're doing for them, and how you're serving them
And all of that comes down to what I would define as, what is your mission for your channel
And I want you guys to comment below
What is your mission for your channel

What is your belief that compels you to make videos and to share what you're sharing on YouTube
And by the way, that belief can be a very powerful tool for growing your channels, because the strongest communities-- both online and offline-- they don't revolve around common interest
They actually revolve around shared beliefs
And when you share what you believe on your channel, other people who share that belief with you will instantly form a much stronger human connection with you
You'll start getting emotions engaged rather than just like intellect, like, OK, I like this guy because of whatever
Oh, now I feel something
The School of Writing, Rhetoric, and Technical Communication has a one-hour capstone course at the end of the semester where students are expected to take much of what they've learned, many of the artifacts and projects and work they've done throughout their major and choose pieces from it to create a portfolio
We really prefer a digital portfolio
This course is a way to further professionalize yourself, even though it's at the very end, you're bringing together not only all this great work that you've done, but you're bringing together all the relationships and things that you've had with you cohort -- of your classmates
All you guys are now in this one class together about to go off and do wonderful things
So that's one of the other critical issues that I have with the course: helping them understand that it's more than just a class to get through
It's a celebration of things that you've learned, things that you've done to be proud of, and the relationships and camaraderie you had with other students
One of the benefits that the Media Fellow, Alexa, brought to the capstone course -- for me she is just an ideal, model student because she understands that the things that she's bringing into class, her assignments, go beyond simply doing an assignment, beyond getting a grade, beyond staying within the confines of the University
She is both student and professional
And as long as I've known her, and it's been three semesters now, that's how she's always been
So she's always had this forethought of seeing that this is what I'm doing now and this is how it needs to work in the future
And I think that's what all students need to bring to this class
Alexa is always there, and students would go up to her first
Before they would go up to any of their own classmates, even before me
She, and I think the idea of the Media Fellow, really is more than a supplement to
Alright, first let's talk about content.
All right, now what we want to talk about is fluency.
do talk a little bit about spoilery things
So I will warn you guys before that happens that way if you don't want to be spoiled at all, if you haven't read the play yet or haven't seen the play yet, you don't have to worry about being spoiled in this video up until a certain point
So I will give you guys a heads up when that's going to occur and you guys can close out of the video at that point
This is a play that's getting pretty divisive reactions
I'm just going to talk about my own experience with this play and my opinions on it and this doesn't in any way negate anyone else's opinion
Obviously that goes for like any opinion that I give because, again, they're all opinions
So I got this book from the library, hence why I'm not holding it up right now
Hi everyone, welcome to Jonny's Daily Dose of Inspirations.
I just want to tell you all Happy Labor Day and I hope everyone all of you had a wonderful day today.
The thing I want to touch on, tap on is how grateful I am to live life.
You know I want to talk about gratitude, how much it really means to me to be alive, to be who I am as a person.
And I'm really grateful for my friends and family, and I try to tell them how much I really appreciate them being around in my life.
And umm, I think that is important for everyone!
So, if you have a neighbor or friend or a family member tell them how much they mean to you and let them know that!
Cause it's very important, because you don't know, life is short you know!
You don't know what's going to happen.
So I said, so with that, with these kind of holidays its very very important to have, have that kind of gratitude and have that quality time with each other.
And ahh, it makes life go, it makes life great, it really really makes it awesome.
Ever wonder what the difference is between a real estate buyer’s agent and a transaction broker?
If you’re a buyer, we have in Colorado two types of real estate agency relationships that you can work with.
You can choose to work with a transaction broker or with a buyer’s agent.
In Colorado it’s a smart idea to make sure you’re hiring a buyer’s agent.
A buyer’s agent will work as your personal advocate to guide you through the complicated process of buying a home.
They will explain the risks of the transaction and how to negotiate the best deal.
A buyer’s agent will also pull comparable sales data and inform you about what other homes have sold for so you can negotiate the lowest price possible on the house you wish to buy.
that tells you the best way to find where to put it in your house, so you can get the most channels
What I'm going to do is try this on both of the TVs we have, one in the living room, one in my bedroom, which these antennas are usually with
I'll see how many channels the TV was able to capture with these antennas, and then put this in, and have it run that Find Channel feature and see how many more, or fewer, it finds with this
Here are the channels we get under DTV, Digital TV
There are 18 channels all together
Not all of them are very clear, some are pretty staticky
But, this is what it's picked up
The TV is in Channel Search mode, and I have put the antenna up on the wall right here, which I taped it, because the suction cups don't stick to the paint and I didn't want to put screws in the wall

now I think that you may got some general ideas about different networking certifications
that it will be definitely helpful for you
Next one is certifications methods
in this initially I would like to talk about Cisco career certifications
Cisco is an American multi-national technology company
Cisco offers five different levels of network certifications
That are, First one is entry

third one is professional, fourth one is expert
and fifth one is architects level
That's the top most level
Hello, I'm Jodie and I'm here to tell you about the scary movie The Grudge
It wasn't really scary
It made me jump
I'm scared of anything so it was kind of scary
Has a nice death rattle in it
{makes noise} over and over and over and over again and it has some creepy little Asian boy
Any little kid's creepy to me, like The Omen, my goodness
Anyway (umm) It's about a house and if you enter the house then (umm) you're kinda doomed I guess
When someone dies and then the grudge of a powerful rage, a curse is left behind and never forgives and never forgets
It's supposed to be creepy
It wasn't that good of a movie
I really wouldn't suggest it
It has Sarah Michelle Gellar
She's usually, she's (stutter) a good actress in it, I just didn't like the plot
It is ninety-one minutes long, which is good
It's PG-thirteen, meaning it can't be that scary
(uhh) (umm) I think this is the widescreen
Yeah it's the widescreen
It has special special (stutter) features and I wouldn't really wanna watch it
{noise} Hello I am Jenny and I am here to tell about You Got Served
It's a dancing video
I don't think it's that good it's a special edition and it's ninety-five minutes long, not really worth the ninety-five minutes as Kevin xxx in it xxx and (uhh) I don't know, they dance all wacky, they pretty good I mean, if I can dance like that, I want to be in a movie but it's about hip hop dancing and their stomp I guess and it has special features and {sigh} the making of you got served feature and it has preview on it too but, I don't know why they put a preview on a DVD but, they did
It has subtitles in English and French and it also has not one comedian on it xxx I can't find it but, it has comedian on it but xxx pretty funny on TV a lot
I think the key to innovation is in the stories that we tell each other, and we'll tell the future.
And the question becomes, what is your story?
And if your story was, "Well, I figured out how to pollute or destroy," it's not a great story.
{noise} This is Dracula
This is (uhh) a DVD movie
And it's basically about (uhh), it's about Dracula and (uhh) he goes around killing people and sucking the blood
That kind of thing
I never really liked this film that much
(uhh) it didn't interest me that much
But (uhh) it does have notable actors and it has Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins and Keanu Reeves
(uhh) This is, it's directed by Francis Ford Coppola
But, like I said, I never liked it that much
(uhh) it's a super good movie
(uhh) the only super good movie I have which is kind of weird
It has a couple special features
There's wide screen, there's subtitles (uhh) you know, nothing that, that (stutter) great, but Yeah, it's interesting to watch
(umm) There's a few (uhh), there's really a couple interesting parts I liked in the movie but overall I didn't like it that much
Hi, today I'm (stutter) reviewing the movie Delta Farce
I didn't say force, I said farce
Stars Larry the Cable Guy, Bill Engvall, and D

Qualls
This has got to be the dumbest movie I've ever seen
There's three reservists, old time reservists from the south, drunk
Worthless people
And they (uhh) have their big, get orders to be sent to Iraq
On their way to Iraq in a plane
They decide they don't want to sleep on the plane so they go back and sleep in a military jet
I mean a military jeep
Well sure enough the jeep gets dropped in the middle of the desert some place
They wake up, and they think they're in Iraq
But instead they're in Mexico
So they start a war in Mexico against some rebels
It's dumb, it's stupid, it's boring
(uhh) A lack of taste, (uhh) what other bad words can I think of
(uhh) I've never seen a movie like this, I don't want to see another one like it
So I think they should've dropped the word delta and just went with the farce
Because it's not a movie, it's a joke
I watched Larry the Cable Guy shows and they've been funny and okay
This is not even that funny, and it's not even okay
Not gonna even give it an okay rating


And you can see here at position 396, there's variation
some plants have a 'C,' some plants have a 'T' And we think that this position, whether they have a C or a T, determines which Rhizobia they interact with
So while Rhizobia strains can vary in how they treat their host plants, plants are not powerless in this relationship
When faced with the choice of bacterial partners in the soil, plants have genes that can determine which bacteria get into their root nodules, and which ones don't
Different plans genotypes choose different bacteria
Here on the left, this plant is interacting with the more beneficial strain, making a good choice
So here on the right, this plant is allowing the less beneficial rhizobia to infect the nodules as well
Hi
This is Dan with my review of Dogville on DVD
Ouch
This movie sucked
(umm) If there was a movie that could be any worse than this, I'd probably call it a play, which is what basically this was as a movie
(uhh) It earns a hearty one out of five stars in my opinion, even though it stars a (uhh) well known and, I think personally, great actress, Nicole Kidman
I just think the whole setup of Dogville (uhh) just, it was weak
It felt like you were looking at Harry Potter's little map, his magic map, with people walking around, and that was the set and that was the whole movie
Yes, we had to actually fast forward this chapter by chapter just to make sure there was never going to be any real scenery or real set to look at
Very disappointing
Dogville (umm), you know from the back of the cover seemed to be kind of interesting, but the way that the screenplay and they set it up basically was a stage act with little more than props as furniture and also black backdrops just to sort of see this whole thing play out
(umm) Never got really into the movie (uhh) because it was just so distracting, and not immersive
It felt like you were sitting in a theater and (umm) sort of tricked into it
Especially since it's a movie you know
So (umm) It's rated R
I would not recommend it, especially if you thought it was a movie
Well, it's not even a movie at that
So Dogville, one out of five stars
Hi this is Dan with my review of Eight Legged Freaks on DVD
And I hadn't even heard about this movie until I actually saw it on tv once and I thought man, that is the worst movie I'd ever seen what is it
And I finally dug it up and discovered Eight Legged Freaks
From the producers of Independence Day and Godzilla
Independence Day and Godzilla this movie is not
Basically it, (stutter) the prime attraction here is that it stars that Dewey guy from, (uhh) not Scary Movie but (uhh) Scream
And he is I think the cop of a town again
But the town is basically infested with giant spiders
Hence the name Eight Legged Freaks and the little boy who's a little nerdy and you know, does the science fair thing, (stutter) you know, is all of a sudden the master of all these arachnids that are terrorizing the town
It's like dead rising, the computer game, the video game on Xbox three-sixty with the zombies (uhh) meets (uhh) arachnids, these spiders
And (umm) basically they're all in the mall and these things are attacking and seriously I thought I was playing a video game
Definitely not fun when you're not playing a video game and attacking everything yourself, but watching other people get spun into cocoons, eaten, and (uhh) maybe some of these spiders getting attacked
So, one out of five stars is my opinion of this movie, do not rent it, do not buy it
It's rated PG-thirteen for sci-fi violence, brief sexuality and language
But definitely not worth your time
Hi
(umm) Today's product that I'm gonna review is a DVD
It's called Dreamgirls starring Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Hudson, Jamie Foxx, (umm) several other different famous (umm) people
But this {clears throat} is the story about (umm) three girls' dreams to become singers and (uhh) it, it (stutter) won (umm) some Academy Awards I don't like this movie
(umm) There's a lot of singing in it, which isn't bad, I love musicals
But (umm) just the whole story line was I I (stutter) didn't care for it
(umm) It was about Jamie Foxx of course played sort of a bad guy who (umm), you know, used kind of used (stutter) the girls against one another to get rich and (umm) get popular
And I I (stutter) just didn't care for the movie
The whole plot line was (umm) just silly and stupid
Hi (umm) today the product that I'm going to review is a DVD
It's called I Love You


Don't Touch Me! (umm) This is a story about a young woman (umm) is probably based in the 1990s or something
But it's a story of a young woman (uhh) who's twenty-five who is (umm) basically in love with love and she's trying to find mister right
But (umm) it's kind of a boring movie
(umm) I just watched it to find out if she happens to get together with her (umm) best friend, who is who is (stutter) a guy (umm) who's in love with her
But she has (umm) no feelings for him, no feelings of love for him in the beginning
And she (umm) the story focuses a lot on (umm) intimacies
{laughter} Between men and women
(umm) A little bit too much
She uses, is a lot of foul language in this movie
This is Blade
This movie is starring Wesley Snipes
It's about a man that is a vampire pretty much
And he's not what you consider one of them I don't know, full vampires
Because he don't go around drinking people blood
Matter of fact he go around fighting actual vampires
He is not getting his blood from sucking people's necks and all that stuff and killing folks or whatever you do
Whatever they do
He actually gets his from a little he he (stutter) got some kind of special stuff that he use
So he don't have to do all that
And he has, he meets this girl that is kind of I don't know, taking an interest to his life a little
And (stutter) trying to figure out what the deal is
What up guys, this is Cade and I'm doing a review of the Blade Trinity
This is the third (umm) installment in the Blade series, the movie is the final one, and this is the special unrated version
With the unrated version what you get is pretty much as it says on the back ten more minutes of action
So you got an extra fight scene right there, it's really long and probably just a couple of slow motion stuff going on so not exactly the best extra
But yeah, also the movie itself isn't very good
It's pretty much, you know, (stutter) Wesley Snipes playing the vampire hunter Blade and it's from the Ghost Rider comic books
And he hunts for vampires and instead in this one he's joined by these people, there's more people in the team but these are the main ones that we're focused upon and they just go around killing vampires
This one didn't have sort of the dark feeling that the first two (umm) Blade films have, it's more just like action oriented
I felt like I was watching Triple X or something like that so it's not exactly very high on my list of action films
So overall I give (umm) Blade Trinity a two because it's a little entertaining, but man, overall it's definitely not as good as the first two by any means
Hey guys, this is Tay here and I'm going to review the very unexciting movie Stigmata
(uhh) This (umm) you can call it pretty much an exorcism movie
You've got (uhh) Patricia Arquette I believe, yes, and she (umm) plays this woman right here who gets a little possessed in the movie
She's a hairdresser then she, you know, like I said gets possessed and you got all these crazy satanic shenanigans going on
(umm) The plot if you ask me is kind of hollow, there's not that much going on
You've got like the typical priest guy that's trying to help her out and so forth and he gets caught up in all this stuff, maybe even falls in love with her or something like that
It's this thing, you know I don't really want to go beyond that in (uhh) describing this plot of the stigmata it's just like when you get like living wounds of like the same stuff that Christ had
So you get like hanging from the arm and the feet and so forth and that she gets to start out with, and that's what begins the possession
(umm) This right here has got some special features including (umm) an alternate ending which is pretty interesting, we were watching that
Audio commentary from the director and deleted scenes and also a music video by Natalie Imbruglia
So, see now I didn't like this movie that much, I gave it two out of five stars, so if you like this movie it's a pretty good DVD to get because you got a lot of special features
You know in the English language there are many different clauses, independent clauses, dependent clauses.
Hi, I'm Paige Carrera and today we're going to talk about independent clauses.
Pretty easy if you think about it.
Independent clause is basically a clause that can stand on its own.
A subject, a verb, doesn't even have to have an object really, but that's pretty much what it is.
Directed by Ron Howard, Backdraft stars (uhh) Kurt Russel and William Baldwin as two Chicago Firefighters out to stop an arsonist
(umm) Has a good strong supporting cast including Donald Sutherland and Robert De Niro
However, It's aged quite a bit and for a murder, thriller, drama starring firefighters it's not all that great of a movie
(umm) For one thing it has William Baldwin, one of the worst of the Baldwin brothers
(umm) In it's some interesting use of fire, particularly the whole concept of back draft, which a lot of people don't really know about
(umm) Starts in Chicago which is my favorite city, which gotta give props for that, that they don't use New York or Los Angeles
Go for something a little grittier, get the (uhh) audience
Of course it's filmed in the nineties otherwise they would've probably used New York for the firefighters
(umm) The movie has very few (uhh) additional features on it
(umm) just captions and subtitles
It's widescreen, yes widescreen see
If you get this for five bucks, I guess it would be okay to get
(umm) It's really not worth watching though
Directed by Ron Howard and he does a good job usually, but not with this
You are looking at Absorb Health's DIM or Di-indolyl-methane Described on the official Dr. Oz blog as a "superantioxidant to help prevent chronic diseases", DIM is a cruciferous vegetable extract that promotes healthy hormonal balance by lessening the effects of excess estrogen.
I'm here to talk about this movie (uhh) Lost in Translation
It stars Bill Murray and (uhh) it runs for an hour and forty-two minutes and it's rated R
This has (uhh) been out for a little while and (umm) I didn't really like this movie
It was really slow, it was boring, (uhh) the story line didn't make any sense at all
It's about some (uhh) TV personality, I guess that's what he was, that (uhh) went to Japan for to to (stutter) do some promotions and (umm) things he did there, the girl he met and all this kind of thing but I just really didn't enjoy this and I I (stutter) just didn't understand what the story was about and this {sigh}
(umm) I don't I don't (stutter) know, you might like this, you might not, but I just didn't really think, you know, I don't think it was up to Bill Murray's standards but (umm) try it, you might think differently
Hi this is a movie that stars Kurt Russell and it's called Dark Blue, and (uhh) (umm) Kurt Russell kind of played, he plays a L

police (uhh) guy and (uhh) he's a mean guy
And (umm) he has a new (uhh) rookie that goes with him and (umm) he sort of teaches him the ropes
But in this movie, (umm) Kurt Russell he plays a kind of a bad character the cop is kind of mean
And (umm) but he's kind of showing the other guy the ropes, so
I I (stutter) didn't care for the movie because of the, I didn't like the storyline, and (uhh) at the end I think (uhh) you know it (stutter) at, the Rodney King (uhh) riot breaks out in the movie
Hi, I'm gonna review a movie in theaters now and this movie's called Knocked Up and it stars Katherine Heigl and some other (uhh) cast members and I was really disappointed with the with the (stutter) movie and felt you know, I got short changed
I wanted to go back to the manager and ask for my money back (uhh) cause this movie is really bad
Now it is rated R for sexual content and language and drugs and it had all three of those and the drugs it had too much and just totally unnecessary
(uhh) (uhh) shots about drugs or scenes with drugs in it and the language in it was horrible
It was bad
(uhh) Really gross language
So you definitely don't wanna take your children to this movie
In fact I wouldn't wouldn't (stutter) recommend the movie to anybody unless you're over a hundred
(uhh) Even then (uhh) It's probably not a good movie to watch
But I was totally (uhh) totally (uhh) turned off by the movie and you notice that, or we notice that in the trailers that they put out on the movie, you know they only showed the funny shots
Had they put out the bad language shot, I don't think as many people would go to see the movie
But (stutters) Katherine was the only (umm) actress in there that did a credible job of acting
All of the other actors were terrible
(uhh) They just weren't good actors
The script was bad and it's just totally a gross movie
I wouldn't recommend it
(uhh) (uhh) Wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody
In fact (uhh) I would give it an award
It was, this is the worse movie in ten years award is what I would give the movie
(uhh) So again, the movie is Knocked Up
Advertisers face a number of challenges in measuring online impact to media.
Some of those challenges I would submit are somewhat self created.
Or I'm feeling really tired, I feel like I need some protein, so I'm gonna get some yogurt
It just takes a lot of practice, and there's some websites you can look at for mindful eating
Just kinda starting to listen to what my body needs
So let me kinda describe what my life looks like now
I can actually like hold a bag of pretzels
zero temptation to eat this right now
For me, that's a miracle
I don't feel guilty for what I eat, almost ever
I feel like I eat when I'm hungry, and I stop when I'm not hungry anymore
And food doesn't control my thoughts anymore
I'm not thinking about it all day long every day
I enjoy the food that I'm eating, and if I don't like it, then I don't really eat it
unless if it's something that's really good for me, and then I make myself eat it anyway -- usually

Hey there, Lucy here and I want to make this video about Prosper.
Prosper is a website where you can get a loan for a reasonable rate.
Also if you're an investor you can invest and also make some money off the site.
So it's a really great site.
Now we're going to discuss the types of customer service.
I'm Pamela Unruh on behalf of Expert Village.
When you are dealing with a customer at home sometimes, you're going to have to put that customer on hold.
We all hate to be put on hold, everybody does.
So when you are putting a customer on hold, how to put yourself in their shoes a little bit.

I got a question recently from a viewer and it's, "Which is better to take? A big job in a little company or a small job in a big company?" Great question
I love that, from a career development standpoint
It really depends on your tolerance for risk and how much you want to take control over your career moving forward
There's positives and negatives to both sides of things
A big job in a smaller company usually gives you more experience
You're exposed to different things because things aren't as segmented as they are in larger companies, but your advancement rests on the ability of the organization to grow, or you to create a job for yourself moving forward, or for you to find a job in another small company
You have to take a little bit more of your own career development on yourself in those smaller companies
Taking a small job


and it can be a similar job, but in a larger organization, it is a smaller job, gives you more of a clear path forward
You have the safety of a large organization that is going to have opportunities for you to grow
Whether it is within your own department moving up, or whether it is in a neighboring department moving up
What you are is you're constrained in your development and that path can be slow, depending on the growth of the organization and just the mindset of the organization moving forward
Truthfully, to get right down to it, I recommend bouncing between the two
I think it's a great opportunity for you to have the security and the understanding of how a large organization works
Don't get me wrong, both of these organizations, small and large, value the experience from the other side
Small companies love that you worked for a large company and you can help them, you can move procedures and everything else in the culture of a large company, because all small companies usually want to be larger
The large companies love the broad-based experience that you had in a smaller company
A lot of times what can happen is, is you can move up the ladder by bouncing between the ladders, and you can actually do that faster than if you just move up one particular type of ladder
What is narrative style in literature?
It is not to be confused with prose style which is a choice of words but narrative style is the choice of who is going to be the narrator, who is going to tell the story?
We have three basic modes, first person, second person, third person, just like our favorite pronouns.
First person I tell the story, it is happening about me.
In the second person not used very often, you read the story and you are the protagonist.
Hello my name is James, president JM Equity Recovery LLC
We are located in Deer Park, NY on Long Island and I am coming to you with the question of the day
The question of the day is: "James, how can I sell my house quickly and still get full retail value?" Now that's a great question
I've just written a blog post about this and if you want all the details you can click on the link below and go right to my blog post get all the details
I am going to summarize it on this video very quickly, and break down to some brief points
Point number one is: Clean Clean and Clean some more
Even vacant houses they get dirty, they get dusty
Consider hiring somebody, make it look immaculate
Number two, cultivate a cohesive and neutral style
Everything has to work together light colors
Maybe a pale yellow in the kitchen to brighten things up
Number three, fix or replace an anything that's broken
The buyer sees that as a sign of weakness, and they jump on that and they try to negotiate, and you lose money, most likely more money than it would have taken to replace the item
Number four, Make any necessary improvements
Anything that is necessary, but don't over improve!! That's one of the biggest problems that people do
The put in too much money, and they wind up losing in the end
The only real safe investment unfortunately is paint
Paint usually works the best
So to consider that

Number 5, get expert opinions about pricing
Pricing your house is the key to a quick sale
If youre too too high you are just going to sit on the market
Number 6, have a great marketing plan
A great marketing plan is a tough one
It is sometimes expensive and time-consuming so I recommend educating yourself about all the finer points of marketing a home
Again it takes time Or number 7 is get a cash offer
Getting a cash offer is what we do here at JM Equity Recovery LLC
We will do all the work for you, so you dont have lift a finger
The house is totally AS IS condition
We buy it just like that
Or even if you have the time or all the money you need to do the repairs in the marketing plan, you might not have the time
Typically a sale with real estate takes three to nine months on Long Island
It's an attorney state
things do take time
So when we buy your house at JM Equity Recovery LLC we pay cash no banks involved
The process moves along very very quickly
We can close in as little as 10 days, so that can eliminate a lot of the waiting around and the aggravation that goes along with the points i just mentioned
So I hope that answers your question If you have any other questions check out my blog first
Hi, I'm Rachel Woodburn and I teach Digital Storytelling at Scottsdale Community College It's one of my favorite classes to teach
The focus of that class is personal narrative
I had the privilege of, over a decade ago, not only attending a workshop from the center for digital storytelling in Berkeley, CA
when it came to Maricopa
But then Joe was in the class and Linda Hicks was there and we started that class together because we wanted all of our students to experience what we had experienced
And I'm Joe Ortiz, and I've been teaching this digital storytelling class for two years now
I took over for Linda Hicks, who retired, and I've thoroughly enjoyed teaching the class with Rachel
I've learned a great deal more about the technique of digital storytelling, particularly from a design and artistic standpoint
Number 5 – Appear To Be Open-Minded Becoming defensive is one of the worst ways to win an argument
Don’t let your opponent sense that you’re digging into your position without being willing to consider alternatives
If you appear to be giving the other side’s position a thoughtful review, then the solution you propose will seem far more sensible
Additionally, your opponent may come to your side, without you having to do anything other than listen
By letting your opponent speak, the situation may resolve itself naturally
Number 6 - Stick To The Subject When someone begins to lose an argument, it’s quite common to see them try to divert the topic to something else – with the hopes that you won’t notice their weakness
When this happens, don’t fall for it
Return to the original topic immediately
People get nervous before they make presentations.
People hear that they have to make a presentation and they freeze.
I know that I’ve shared bits and pieces
And for the last two or three weeks, the Lord has been taking me back and walking me through another situation that happened to me that I thought I had completely healed from
But God is so awesome and that he would take you back when you’re ready and just bring even deeper healing to your spirit and to your mind and to your body
And he will teach us through our past
He will teach us through experiences that we went through, not that he brought on this experience
What to wear when making presentations.
There is a school of thought that says the better you look the more impressed audiences will be with you.
The better your jewelry, the more successful you will look, the more credible you will therefore be.
I think in sales situations that might be the case.
The problem with that is what are you looking at right now?
Are you looking at me or are you looking at my jewelry?
Are you listening to my message, or are you wondering if these are fakes?

If what you owe on your first mortgage is higher than the fair market value of that property, we can help you get rid of those junior mortgages.
Whether they are home equity lines of credit or just a judgment lien.

[sighs] Hi community of awesome
Today is November 9th, 2016 but by the time you guys see this, it'll have been exactly a week since the US election
And six days since we knew what the results were
Today I was going to do some upbeat writing vlog, um, like I tend to do even though I hadn't decided what the topic was yet


But when I saw the news this morning I knew I wasn't going to be able to do that
I'm going to be honest, you guys, I'm hurting

I've decided I'm going to allow myself to feel this today, and then tomorrow I'm going to start fighting
But the way I'm going to fight is through writing because writing is a political act
I drafted INTO THE BLACK, which is BEYOND THE RED's sequel, over the summer
INTO THE BLACK is a very political book
I don't think I fully realized just how much the politics in INTO THE BLACK match up with our politics today until I was going through reader notes, but they do
When I was first drafting INTO THE BLACK I had a lot of hope for where this election would go
I was nervous, too, and scared about what could happen, but I truly believed that we had a really good chance to embrace a message of progressing forward, and embracing one another, and loving each other, and trying—trying to see each other as equals more than we do right now


[sighs] But that's not where it ended
In a way I'm glad I drafted it over the summer because I'm not sure how much hopefulness I would've been able to put into this manuscript had I known where we were going to end
So, yeah, right now I'm letting myself feel this pain, and this anger, and this betrayal, and [sighs] this fear, and everything else, and I'm going to remember it when I'm revising
But I'm not going to let it break me
I'm going to fight harder
Writing diverse worlds where love wins and equality is central is a political act
Just as writing monolithic worlds where one group holds power over the other and uses it to oppress the other, or uses it to pretend that the other doesn't exist at all, is also a political act
And it's one of the politics that won today
I want you to know whatever you're writing, whether it's diverse or not, it's political
I want you to know that even if you don't physically have politics in your book like I do, it's political
I want you to know that how you choose to create the world of your book, whether it reflects our reality, or whether it chooses to pretend that much of our world doesn't exist and erases them out of the narrative completely, it's political

KPMG's Major Australian Banks Half Year 2012 report shows that although the majors have posted a healthy profit for the 2011-2012 half year but lack of growth will be a focus for investors.
My name is Pat Iyer, and I am President of the Pat Iyer Group and have run a successful Legal Nurse Consulting business since 1989. I mentor nurses who want to become Legal Nurse Consultants.
I review hundreds of resumes and CVs a year from Legal Nurse Consultants.
The CV is short for Curriculum Vitae.
A resume is a concise one or two page document that highlights your skills, education, and experience.
The CV is a longer document prepared if you have extensive teaching, research, or publishing experience.
The difference between a CV and a resume is primarily in the area of focus and length.
A resume is something that's brief, that describes your primary areas of  responsibility.
A CV tends to go into greater depth.
Both documents include strong action words to emphasize your accomplishments.
Use words like created, initiated, saved, accelerated, launched strengthened, or broadened.
Documents with typos automatically go into a reject pile.
If  people cannot proofread their own resumes and CVs I know they're not going to be able to proofread the kinds of involved reports that we produce as Legal Nurse Consultants.

Hi
(umm) Today's product that I'm going to review is the DVD Bewitched starring Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell
I didn't care for this movie {laugh}
(umm) I give it probably a two, a rating of two
And the reason I didn't like it is because Will Ferrell plays an actor who is going to be doing a new and improved version of Bewitched and then (umm) Nicole Kidman plays a real life witch who comes down to earth to live and then ended up being cast in the role of Samantha on Bewitched
It's just a really corny movie
(umm) I hate the way that they did that
Pretending that (umm), you know, there were two people and then they were gonna start playing the actors Samantha and Darren so it's really not about Bewitched
(umm) It's more about this girl who's a witch who plays Samantha
But as I said I don't really care for it
I mean it's about two hours long
Hi
(umm) today the product that I'm going to review is a DVD
This is Cold Mountain starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger
This was the winner of the academy award (umm) best supporting actress, Renee Zellweger
I hated this movie
{laughter} (umm) I give it probably two stars just because of the actors that are in it, I like them
{laughter} But if they didn't have those actors I would give it a one
The story is about (umm) the civil war and how this town, I believe it's called, (uhh) it's Cold Mountain (umm) in North Carolina
And (umm) the men of Cold Mountain decide to go and join the the (stutter) war
(umm) the story is mainly about Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger as they try to survive through the war and wait for their loved ones to come back
It's xxx a stupid film
I hate it
Nicole Kidman kind of goes cuckoo during the movie
(umm) {laughter} there's battle scenes and it's it's (stutter) not a movie that I like
Hey, take it easy
This is Nacho Libre starring one Jack Black and a pair of tights
(uhh) The story's about Jack Black, that guy right there
He works in a (uhh) monastery
I'm not sure the technical term but he's he's a (stutter) practically a priest
By night he raises money by fighting as a, a (stutter) luchador
Which is a hispanic wrestler
Now I'm not a human, Spanish, luchador, wrestling dictionary but I'm, that's pretty sure what I mean, what it means
(umm) The comedy leaves you wanting a little more
It's kinda weird, it's you wanna laugh but you don't
There's some good parts
Jack Black has a mustache
Personally I gave it one and a half stars out of five
(uhh) It looks nice
The comedy's in the same vein I'd say, as the director's previous film Napoleon Dynamite but it's just not all there unfortunately
Which is kinda sad cause I was really hyped up about this movie
I didn't watch it until I bought it
Alright, this is (uhh) not a bad pickup for a bargain movie
It's called The Wrong Guy, starring (uhh) David Foley of Kids in the Hall fame, that Canadian sketch show and Jennifer Tilly who was in, I believe, Bride of Chucky and a bunch of other films but that's the only one that comes to mind cause they're not exactly the greatest actors and actresses in the world
David Foley was also the voice in the Pixar film A Bug's Life which is one of my favorite films, but unfortunately some people don't view it as the best, one of the best (stutter) better Pixar films, but {snort} what do they know? Anyways this is (uhh) it's a comedy
I think it's a direct to DVD comedy
(uhh) It has some funny jokes in it that are alright
I give it two out five stars
If you see it on like (uhh) (umm) TV or something like that I'd say watch it
(umm) David Foley is pretty funny, the rest of the cast kind of (uhh)
Otherwise two out of five stars as I said before and (uhh) he's accused of a murder, well he thinks he's accused of a murder that he didn't commit and it's basically him as a fugitive running away from people that aren't trying to chase him, although he does find the real killer
Keanu Reeves has risen to be one of the (uhh) most popular (uhh) action stars of pretty much in the last, probably a decade
(uhh) He however did get started making (uhh) oh, rather bad films
Point Break is one of his worst
{hmm}, Point Break he plays this, a young FBI agent that (uhh) pretty much goes on (uhh) or starts with a company and has a partner, Gary Busey, who is a little bit more (uhh) experienced
He gives undercover and becomes a surfer and someone who's generally addicted to extreme sports
He meets up with (uhh) Patrick Swayze, which (stutter) the is known as the world's most shirtless man
(umm) They (uhh) work together yeah, to uncover, Busey and Keanu Reeves work together to uncover (uhh) a string of bank robberies that are portrayed (uhh) (stutter) that are done by the (uhh) surfer gang that Keanu Reeves joins
(umm) There's also skydiving, (umm) bad acting, and in general just mayhem
Curtis here with the new (uhh) the new Hannibal movie, Hannibal Rising
Now this is a blockbuster exclusive I guess
Apparently a straight to DVD rental
(uhh) So {cough} you can find it at any Blockbuster
(uhh) I was expecting something a little more gory, maybe a little more horror-ish
But it was really really like (stutter) timid and (uhh) pretty, pretty (uhh) pretty low, I don't know low budget but not really I don't know
Hannibal (uhh) Hannibal Lecter wasn't really, he was played as a character that was like a teenager and he, he (stutter) was kind of like progressing into his cannibalistic stage of the other movies
(uhh) I wouldn't really recommended it if, recommend it (stutter) if you wanna like watch a Hannibal movie I'd recommend just going to see like Silence of the Lambs or (uhh) Hannibal, the other Hannibal movies
Which are okay, they're not, they're not (stutter) that great either
But (uhh) I don't know I'd recommend it if you want
(stutter) If you wanna see a movie that takes before Hannibal I recommend it but if you like the Hannibal movies and you don't wanna ruin it, don't see this movie cuz it will probably ruin it and (uhh) you probably won't like Hannibal anymore cuz he's I don't know
Really, really weakling in this movie, okay, alright, that's my review
Hi
This movie (umm) review is about the two-thousand seven movie called Allegro
(umm) It's basically kind of confusing movie and if I had to give it a grade, it would probably be like (uhh) a scale on one to ten it would probably be a five or a six
(umm) The piano playing in the film music were pretty much exciting (umm) and excellent
(umm) This story is really complicated to follow
(umm) It was just hard to go along with the whole movie because (umm) because of the fantasy portion it was it was (stutter) related to the zone and (uhh) basically some people like me cannot follow it, and it was just kind of boring and confusing
(umm) I don't know it was basically not a movie from mainstream and (uhh) basically it was just kind of a really confusing and boring movie like I said and it's not worth paying your money for in my opinion if it's even out in your theaters
It's really not a great movie
I'm here to review this dvd
And it's called Sixteen Candles
It stars Molly Ringwald, and (uhh) it's been out for, for quite awhile, so (uhh), you know you may have to look a little harder to find it if you want to see this
(uhh) I was very disappointed in this because it's rated PG
Now that has to be a typo, because there's (uhh) a lot of bad language, and there's nudity in this movie
And (uhh) I would be really, really careful in watching your kids, (uhh) letting your kids see this because it's not appropriate
And it's, that's my recommendation this this (stutter) is not appropriate for for (stutter) young kids to see
It (uhh) I believe it's even been on tv but I'm sure they had to delete those scenes but if you watch this movie, those things are in there and (uhh) for little kids, this movie is deceptive because it looks like it's, you know, it's for (uhh) teenagers or whatever, but (umm) I I (stutter) just was greatly disappointed in this, but (uhh) I don't, I don't (stutter) (uhh) suggest you watch this at all
I mean if you want to check it out if you're curious after what I said, that's that's (stutter) up to you but (uhh) I don't understand why it says PG on the back when all that stuff is in there, so
Hi my name is xxx and today I will xxx the movie for you Kickin' It Old School which is going to be playing in theaters
Kickin' It Old School is (uhh) movie about a kid who is very interested in break dancing and (uhh) given in his childhood days he gets into an accident and while break dancing itself and he goes into a coma for twenty years
(umm) He wakes up twenty years later and (uhh) he finds out that he's still kid but with that and also he xxx that dream of making it big in breaking dance in the break dance industry so he regroups his friends and they enter a competition (umm) and (umm) the movie goes on from there there is also this girl who is who is so interested in him (uhh) (umm) same thing I mean (uhh) the rivals from his childhood is again the same rival and (uhh) the whole movie is about how he win the xxx and how he wins the whole competition so the I mean the plot plot (stutter) sounds just okay but the movie is utterly disappointing I mean I did not really enjoy the movie a lot basically because of (umm) the fact that you know xxx that the guy as a kid and (uhh) I mean none of the guys did an exceptional jobs so ended up very disappointed with the movie I do not recommend you watch the trailers I don't even recommend you watch it because (uhh) I actually just rated (umm) two out of five so that's all
Hey ExpoTV, how are you doing today? I'm going to review one of my favorite movies of all time, this is Heat
It is a Michael Mann film, and it has two of the greatest actors of all time playing on the (uhh) same movie: Al Pacino and Robert De Niro
This is your average cops-and-robbers film, but it's not so average
I believe it's one of the best, if not the best, cops-and-robbers good guy-bad buy film of all time
Al Pacino plays a detective and Robert De Niro plays the (uhh) bad guy who is doing all these heists
And it is a great movie, a little long, three hours, but it definitely packs a punch
Supporting cast is great
You have Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman
Dennis Haysbert makes a small role in here
You all know him from the Allstate commercials and for being the ex-president on twenty four
Overall, I would give this movie a five out of five
Definitely watch this movie multiple times
I was first brought to this movie when I was at film camp from North Carolina School of the Arts
We were supposed to watch Bridge on the River Kwai
Our TA instead let us show Heat
I'm glad he did
This is one of my all-time favorite movies
And this right here is the two-disc special edition
It came out about two years ago in two thousand five
ten years after the movie was released in theaters
And you get a lot of special features on the movie
You have eleven additional scenes, five new making documentaries
(uhh) They were, they go back to L

There (stutter) are shooting locations
It talks about the script, how it was developed, how it became Heat
And basically, it actually has Al Pacino and De Niro
There's a famous scene where they meet in the coffee shop
A lot of rumors swirling around the Internet that Pacino and De Niro were there on different days, they were not actually there filming at the same time
But, believe it or not, that rumor is actually dispelled
They were, believe it or not, Pacino and De Niro, rivals, together in one scene at the same time
Definitely a great film
If you have not seen this, I highly recommend this
A lot for the guys, definitely want to pick this up
Great action film
Great heist scene
I'm sure you all remember Dane Cook talking about this
{noise} Where's the van? {noise} you know in his comedy thing
Now the first thing that we have to talk about when we're preparing to be conversational in our style when we're giving a speech, is enthusiasm and passion.
And what this means, enthusiasm is pretty obvious.
Hi, my name is Jordan and I'm gonna be reviewing the movie the DVD, Gladiator
Now this movie came out (uhh) a while back and before I saw it I really thought it was just gonna be a straight gore (uhh) flick
I thought it was just gonna have lots of (umm) lots of blood, lots of violence and that's all it was gonna be about
Well it turns out this movie's actually really really good
It has a great storyline, the actors were great, there was nothing bad about this movie
I enjoyed every bit of it
Sometimes it can be a little bit long, but (umm) it really was a great movie
It has (umm) lots of action sequences in it
It does have a lot of blood and gore and stuff but it also has a great storyline
So (umm) Ridley Scott (umm) directed this movie and he did a great job
Everything in this movie is great
I would recommend it to anyone who likes action movies who doesn't mind seeing a little blood and gore and things like that
But (umm) it has a great story, it even has a little bit of a love story for you know, the ladies
So (umm) yep
Hey expo tv I'm Dea and as a rule I love superhero movies, I've said that before
(umm) I love everything about them, the cheese factor, the action sequences, the whole thing
However there are there are (stutter) some of, some exceptions to that rule
As to all rules
(umm) One of the exceptions to my rule is Daredevil
This is very likely one of the worst {laugh} movies of all time
Okay, I'm not saying this out of hatred or to be stylish
But Ben Affleck is seriously a black hole of talent
Because no matter how many awesome people you put in a movie, Ben Affleck can suck any good out of it
It's true
There are a couple movies that Ben Affleck is in that I I (stutter) actually like
And I don't personally, I don't have like a vendetta against him, I don't hate him or anything
I, he's not one of those people like, if he's in a movie I refuse to watch it
There are a couple of those people
But it just seems like anytime Ben Affleck's in a movie, it's just bad
Anytime like post the nineties at least
(umm) I mean a ton of really cool people are in here
Jennifer Garner plays Elektra Nacho, or as we like to call her, electric nachos
(umm) She, as cool as Jennifer Garner is, and as hot as she looks in all this leather, she still cannot fight the sucktasticism that is Ben Affleck
It's sad
(umm) Michael Clark Duncan is in here and we all know he's stone cold cool
And so is Colin Farrell
And like, I like Colin Farrell
But this movie's just not good and I highly suspect that it's because of the Ben Affleck
Hey ExpoTV I'm Dea and something that I've mentioned so many times in so many different videos is that I love superhero movies
And I just like the cheese factor, the cheesier the better
That's how much I love them I'm like a big fan
(umm) And I've also mentioned that I do very few negative reviews, alas this is one of those and what's even worse is that it is about a superhero movie
(umm) This right here is Hulk
Okay, here's something that I have to tell you
I will usually stick it out no matter what like, if I'm reading a book that I don't care for, I'll finish reading it anyway just to get to the end and you know have an actual educated view of it
If I'm watching a movie I'll stick it out until the end because you know, I want to see what happens maybe it redeems itself
This movie was so bad that I couldn't you know, I tried watching it to the end and I was like this is awful on a level that I have previously not experienced in my existence
I mean like, like Shazam with Shaquille O'Neal awful
So as a person who like, you know I know a lot of people who are like, I don't, I don't (stutter) dig the superhero movies, they're too corny for me
&gt;&gt;James Schiro - Davos Debates 2009 (Environment) Hi YouTube.
I'm Jim Schiro the CEO of Zurich Financial Services.
About three weeks ago we announced a significant climate change initiative at Zurich.
Hi my name is Nalin and today I will be reviewing for you the movie Can't Hardly Wait
(umm) Can't Hardly Wait is a movie which starts out as a, in a, in a (stutter) high school graduation ceremony kind of a setting and (uhh) it starts out as everybody is discussing in the, in the (stutter) (uhh) ceremony that (uhh) Amanda was (uhh) dumped by a man named Mike Dexter
So Amanda is actually the homecoming queen and (uhh) Mike Dexter is the homecoming king
And (uhh) they were like the hot couple of the high school for four years and (uhh) that's where the whole hype about their breakup
So then it starts out that the guy, there's a guy who likes (uhh) the girl Amanda
(uhh) Who is the prom queen
So that guy other prom queen Amanda is played by Jennifer Love Hewitt and (uhh) the other guy who likes her a lot is played by Ethan Ambrey
(uhh) The movie on the whole is very average, I mean (uhh) there were very, very boring parts in the whole movie
Not very exciting stuff
(uhh) Not too much humor, very predictable and you can actually just figure out what's gonna happen in the end
So it's a very boring movie I would just rate it one out of five
(uhh) A special mention about (uhh) Ethan Ambrey's acting in the movie
It is horrible
(uhh) I mean I don't know what other kind of expressions he's given but he looks at I mean, many times he just looks like he's having (uhh) stomach problems so his acting is just horrible
But from that Jennifer Love Hewitt is the main reason I got the DVD to watch and (uhh) she's looking cute and (uhh) she's looking pretty good, so
Hi, I'm back and I'm going to be giving a review of a movie I did not like, Ocean's Twelve
Now I loved Ocean's Eleven, it was just a great movie and it had all these great actors in it and it was just a lot of fun, but Ocean's Twelve seems like it was really stretching to you know, find a plot to find some action, just all around to find some entertainment
I just wouldn't recommend it
I mean it's got George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Matt all those people
(umm) But none of em were just very good in this movie
I mean, they they're (stutter) good actors, it's just a boring movie
Now the plot of this movie is that they (umm) are actually I believe in Europe
Yeah they're in, it's been awhile since I've seen it, they are in Europe and looking to find a safe and it just, you know I honestly don't even remember that much but I was just falling asleep during the movie, it just wasn't good
Now they seem to have (uhh) redeemed themselves in Ocean's Thirteen, which is actually out in theaters right now
I just saw that and that's a fantastic movie
So don't write off the entire series just because this one movie is bad
But it is
If you haven't seen Ocean's Eleven, go see it
It's amazing
Skip Ocean's Twelve, go see Ocean's Thirteen
So, I would give this movie, a two out of five
It was just it was just weak and it was not something that I really liked that much
Yeah alright, well, have a good night
Well, that-- it may be readjusting how the-- what their marketing message is.
This is Dustin and today I'm reviewing The Good Shepherd, with Robert De Niro, Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie
It's a story about when the CIA basically came into effect and how it came into effect and some of the major events that led to this, mostly dealing with the Cuban missile crisis and the Cold War
(umm) Basically in this movie Matt Damon is a CIA agent and it goes through the effects that it has on his life of how secretive it is and everything and (umm) having to keep the secrets even from his family and how this ruins his family life basically and (umm) about how the US government is corrupt (uhh) in a way and and (stutter) (uhh) interfere with other country's affairs and everything
Overall this movie wasn't very good
It lacked action
I mean it had a story but it was very (uhh) drawn out
The movie is two hours and forty minutes
The movie I'm reviewing is The Ex, and it's in movie theaters now and it stars (umm) Zach Braff and Amanda Peet
And basically it's just (umm) the two of them are husband and wife and the story's just about (umm) him losing his job and they go to live with her parents and then he works for her dad
And (umm) The one guy that he works with was involved with Amanda Peet (umm) before, and so he's the ex
(umm) But it's supposed to be a comedy and it really wasn't all that funny
(umm) I had somebody when I watched the movie (umm) near us who was just laughing obnoxiously at everything so that also kind of made it a little weird
But (umm) it just like I said it wasn't really too funny and the story line wasn't really all that great either
so (umm) if you're looking to just go see any kind of movie, (umm) you could go see it but it's not one I would really recommend
And I probably wouldn't recommend (uhh) renting it either when it comes out on DVD so
Here we have Stealth
This movie was pretty predictable, and, not that entertaining
I mean, it has all the big names in it that you've heard before
(umm) Josh Lucas, Jessica Beil, and Jamie Foxx
However, I don't know, it just lacked a lot of good, in the movie
I (stutter) without a better word good
(umm), I don't know if it was the screenplay or what, but this movie just wasn't very memorable and not very captivating
(umm) The whole premise of this movie is that (umm), the government has made an AI plane, which that means (stutter) artificial intelligence
That (uhh), plane is very smart, and learns, and it put it together with this three man team, the three characters on the front to go on missions and then as the premise of the movie begins, it goes haywire
So, from that point, I'll let you decide, but that's just on the back, the back (stutter) of the thing
I'm not ruining anything for you
I don't think it's possible
The movie ruins it for itself
So, I'd probably give it a, one out of five
Today we're gonna check out Mission: Impossible two, starring Tom Cruise
(uhh) Honestly I thought this movie sucked
(uhh) Mission Impossible one, I thought was much better (uhh) because it was actually (uhh) it had a good plot
It was interesting and it wasn't just there (uhh) to to (stutter) throw in as much action as possible
It was a a (stutter) true spy movie
This one (uhh) is to me, pretty much ridiculous and it seems as though, they were just trying to make it as extreme as possible and that is definitely the truth in one scene where (uhh) Tom Cruise (uhh) is riding through some flames on his motorcycle doing a nose wheelie and stuff like that
I mean just look at the cover
Look at that
That's how extreme this is
It's a little too extreme for my taste
But if you like kind of dumbed down action movies then this is for you
My name is Phillip Beningoso.

Hello, this is Michael Niren, an immigration lawyer and founder of visaplace.com.
So here's an update on the Syrian refugee crisis.
Obviously the concerns have been heightened due to the terrorist attack in Paris this week - a horrific attack.
The concern is that at least one of the terrorist was a holder of a Syrian passport.
Now whether or not the influx of Syrian refugees will include some potential terrorists remains to be seen.
But the demographics of this group is concerning.
Many or at least the majority has been reported to be male, young male.
I will be reviewing the (uhh) special edition of Groundhog Day starring (uhh) Andie MacDowell and Bill Murray
(uhh) This is probably one of my favorite movies and definitely my favorite comedy, you know, that I own
Groundhog Day, for those of you who don't know, Bill Murray plays a very jaded you know, a very cynical (uhh) weatherman who is sent to, you know, his most (stutter) hated assignment, which is you know, covering xxx, the groundhog day to see whether he sees his shadow or not
And he goes today, it's a horrible day and there's a snowstorm so he can't leave the town so you know, he stays in the same place he stayed and when he gets up the next morning, it's groundhog day again and you know the whole day just completely repeats itself, you know, he's kinda think he's going nuts and you know it just keeps happening over and over again even if he, you know, happens to die during the day, he literally just wakes back up and you know that same morning, (uhh) over and over again
(umm) You know throughout he, you know the love interest, Andie MacDowell, falls in love (stutter) continually tries, you know, to get into the bed, you know, although he only has an actual day to do it because he keeps starting over
I mean honestly, it's just a really, really well made movie, it's definitely (uhh) Bill Murray, you know, at one of his best and most comical roles
His his (stutter) performance is absolutely hilarious, you know, the different emotions
It kinda follows, you know, the (uhh) you know five stages of death, you know, where you have to denial and you know, anger, and you know finally at the end acceptance
(umm) This is an all around great movie and you know, it does have a bit of (uhh), you know, philosophical vibe to it, you know, as far as, you know, should approach life but it doesn't really take itself too, too (stutter) seriously
(umm) The disk itself isn't bad, it's got an audio commentary by the director, you know, a documentary called the wait of time which is pretty cool, you know, some theatrical trailers and (umm) photographies, and that's really about it, there's not a whole, whole lot here but really, (uhh) this is the only version of the movie that I have ever seen and I just wanted the movie really, really badly, you know, the extras are kind of icing on a cake
I'll be reviewing Ang Lee's Hulk
This is the two disc special edition
(umm) I didn't really think it was possible for them to make a movie about the Hulk that was actually boring, but somehow they managed to do it
(uhh) This is one of the movies where I really found myself just constantly looking at the (uhh) at the clock to see how much longer it had
You know, and I'm a pretty I'm pretty (stutter) big fan of, you know, slow paced movies
I don't need a whole, whole lot of action
But this one just was badly paced
(umm) You know, slow, (stutter) it was the characters weren't developed enough, you know, to hold me, you know, during (ahh) the slower-paced parts of the movie and that kind of thing
(uhh) It was just kind of a poorly made movie in general
You know, Ang Lee just really tried to put too much style and not enough substance into it
(uhh) You know, the Incredible Hulk is basically about a scientist, Bruce Banner, who is messing with (uhh) gamma radiation
And he turns himself into (uhh) basically this gigantic, when he gets angry, he becomes this gigantic green, you know, ridiculously strong (uhh) hulk
And (uhh) {cough} basically his level of anger, you know, (stutter) correlates directly with, you know, how big he gets and, you know, the rest of the U

government and all that has to try and stop him, {mumble}
You know, it's not that complicated of a storyline, honestly
(uhh) The DVD itself isn't too bad
It's got some never (uhh) some deleted scenes, you know, (uhh) some (uhh) special effects documentaries
You know, look at taking the Hulk from the comics to the movie
(uhh) You know, a motion capture suit documentary
So, you know, and some stills from the comics, that kind of thing
I'll be reviewing (uhh) Queen of the Damned
This movie is based of (uhh) Anne Rice's vampire chronicles
(uhh) It's basically about Aliyah who plays the queen of the vampires who is, you know basically brought back into modern world after you know being in hibernation basically by (uhh) Lestat who is Anne Rice's kind of antihero who is now become a (uhh) rock goth you know, rock star who basically you know, brings her back
Area to consciousness through you know his attraction to him
And basically you know she wants to you know take over the world and all that other kinda stuff for vampires
(uhh) It's a pretty forgettable movie honestly you know it's got a really heavy grunge soundtrack the movie kinda fits in its (stutter) shot you know very slickly
You know trying to be just very uber cool to the point where it's almost just kind of goofy
It's kind of overdoes it in a lot a lot (stutter) of ways
You know Aliyah is you know a decent performer, Stuart Townsend is kind of pretty (uhh) you know Brad Pitt did a lot better job playing Lestat
In (uhh) interview with the vampire
(uhh) Than she does here, I mean than (uhh) Stuart Townsend does here
But the DVD itself you know if you're a fan of the movie is (uhh) you know pretty complete
It's got audio commentaries, directors and special you know (uhh) documentaries on special effects
It's got music videos for some of the songs
{cough} You know that are used and saw in the movie
And like I said it's (uhh) it's a pretty decent collection you know for this movie if you're a fan of Anne Rice you know and her particular interpretation of vampires which personally I think just kind of ruined the whole mythos you know vampires in general making them too I guess, gothic and you know upper class and emo and that kind of thing
Hi everyone this is Matt Curfman here for our April edition of Matt's Minutes for 2016. It's been probably 4 or 5 weeks since my last video and in that video I talked about trying to predict or rather not trying to predict what the markets will do in day, a week, a month even a six month period.
And I quoted Warren Buffett.
And so what I guess a little bit of a takeaway is we're seeing the markets actually come off of their lows that had started back in March and we're actually seeing some decent price recovery in the broad markets and in individual holdings.
A lot of you attended and we actually were at full capacity at the end of March for our Halftime Report over at Ella Sharp where both myself and David had a chance to talk to a lot of you on what we thought was happening in the environment, explaining and clarifying that the environment is going to happen - we can't control the environment.
We can control how we respond, how we react, how we plan in the volatile environments.
So, many of you who rode through the market swings, we had 300 and 400 point days, I guess we're getting a little bit more to a normalizing period, at least for now.
Doesn't mean that that's going to continue but let's take a deep sigh, a deep breath, and just be comfortable where we're at for the moment.
I guess I would tell you our tone is optimistic but we're cautious.
We feel really good about making the decision to hold onto things through the downswing.
I told you in January and February and many of you received confirmations from Fidelity when the markets were at their lows we did actually make some changes within the portfolio.
Those by and large are playing out very well.
And so we'll continue to monitor each of those things and look for opportunities as they present themselves.
Some of the bigger exposures you have would be high yield, things like a Medley Capital, a Pennant Park, a Guggenheim credit fund in addition high exposures in small caps, especially biotechs.
&gt;&gt;JESSICA HENDERSON DANIEL: Greetings.
I am Jessica Henderson Daniel.
It is an honor to be a candidate for president-elect of the American Psychological Association.
The publication of the Hoffman report is the current major concern of the organization.
I have read the report and the numerous emails on several listserves.
Given that one possible lesson learned is that responding in haste can result in later regrets.
All candidates responses to a question about the Hoffman report will appear in the Monitor.
The discipline of psychology is powerful and it can become even more powerful.
That would be my goal as APA president, that is to move APA into the power lane of influencial organizations in this country.
Why use such strong language?
Because psychology is used every day in almost every way.
Nearly every aspect of the human existance and experience can be influenced by psychological science, practice, education and public interest.
Psychologists can create a stronger presence and exert greater influence than we have ever used before.
Sometimes you can get so caught up in your own life and your own world you live in that you don’t see that goodness is out there
You know, there’s lots of trappings in life, there’s also lots of trappings in fame, lots of trappings with everything, so to be able to kind of make people stop and think for a second and find a different direction to take their life in
It’s always a good thing and I, you know I dream but… I don’t want people to have to go through some of the bad things I had to go through when I was growing up
Today I'm going to share 4 top tips for first-time buyers saving for their first home.
Soaring rents, high house prices and the Central Bank's minimum deposit requirements mean that it's particularly difficult for first-time buyers to save up for their first property purchase these days.
So i'm going to share 4 top tips to help you save for that big purchase.
Number 1, set up a regular saver account.
The first thing the bank is going to do when considering you for a mortgage is look at the last 6 months of your financial statements.
And they will be really impressed to see disciplined and consistent saving habits, even if it's just a small amount you're putting away every month.
EBS is currently offering a 3.00% return to regular savers and KBC is offering a 3.5% return to savers who have a current account with the bank.
Number 2, approach signup incentives with caution.
Most of Ireland's major banks are currently offering cash-back to new mortgage customers and in some cases this is as much as €4,000 cash-back for a €200,000 mortgage.
These offers can be really, really tempting but it's vital to look at the repayment rate you're signing up for and consider the overall lifetime cost of the loan.
Number 3, switch gas and electricity suppliers.
DAVID BELL: Some of the interesting trends that we're really seeing in this online space now is sort of the interaction between online and offline.
And of course, now we all have better technology to understand not only what people are buying, but who they're talking to, and actually where they are kind of right now.
So I could be walking past the Starbucks and then receive into my cellular device, [? order a ?] latte, come in, you get a free biscotti.
The sofa had so many problems that I just wanted my money back and I wanted to go someplace else and not deal with them anymore.
Contacted 311 who transferred me to the Department of Consumer Affair and I never knew I could do anything like this.
I called up and I got somebody and they were amazing.
They said we can file a complaint and you have to send us x amount, we’ll send you forms and that’s exactly what I did.
And they were great.
JOHN GERZEMA: When you think about innovation and how it's being used to reach consumers in today's environment, I really see this sort of both ways.
hello so since the general election in the UK is coming up I wanted to make a few videos focused on politics and I thought why not start with the history of my political views so my first introduction into politics was when I started reading my parents' newspaper in my early teens so I formed my political opinions around one news source which is never good practice.
That's why the first political party I supported was UKIP and the newspaper surprise surprise was the Daily Mail.

Hi everyone!
As you know, this week we're taking another step forward in the essay writing process.
This week we're writing our outline, and this outline will serve as a map for your body paragraphs.
How do we do that?
When you download your template for the outline, it's going to look something like this: As the directions indicate, you are only required to complete the bolded parts.
If you would like to complete the sections that are not bolded, that will be fine, too, but these sections are not required.
The bolded parts of the outline are required.
To complete this worksheet, you must first share your thesis statement in the appropriately labeled section.
Let’s take a peek at what a good thesis statement might look like.
For my thesis statement I have written:  Device applications are one of the most effective inventions in the 21st century because of the economic, social, and educational benefits they supply.
With this thesis statement, you can see that I have listed the three points in my thesis statement that reflect the points I am going discuss in my body paragraphs.
In the outline under Roman numeral #1, you can see that I will list as my first body paragraph topic: Device applications are one of the most effective inventions in the 21st century because of the economic benefits they supply.

&gt;&gt; I think in the short answer, I think that China will be able to pull the economy out of the crisis.
And I reason I say that is because that in for the GDP growth in China had reached certain percent in the first half of the year, and we see that significant economic stimulus package in China.
The role of religious movements and the religious leaders and religious believers in pro-democracy is very bad, because I believe that the religious must be away of the democracy and the political issues
But what happening in Egypt is, religious have a very big role, affected negatively, because we saw that Christians and the churches called people to vote for someone who may be Christian
And mosques and Muslims extremist and Muslims and the imam – we call the leader of Muslim in some mosque, in one of the mosque – call people to vote for Salafist and the Muslim Brotherhood
And they control the will of people, which is not good

It’s – in Egypt, it’s play a very big role
The religious and the religious leaders play a very big role, because people – the religious in the Egyptian people is a very big issue they interested in
of a building on Mars and balloons up as his eyeballs pop out, isn’t really plausible
Not that much of the movie is
It’s a common misconception that the difference in pressures inside your body and outside in space would equalize so quickly that your head would just pop, but actually, your body will keep everything in place, kind of like a pair of Spanx
Your skin, muscles, and blood vessels have a lot of tension to them
They’ve got all kinds of nice, springy proteins in them, like collagen and fibrillin, and their cumulative tension provides enough force to keep your blood from evaporating and your eyes from popping out
And your head definitely won’t explode
So that scene in 2001: A Space Odyssey where Dave has to break into his own spaceship from outside is actually pretty accurate
His head doesn’t blow up or anything
it’s just really windy for a second as the air rushes out of the escape hatch
As long as you keep your exposure to a vacuum under 10-15 seconds, you’ll be fine
You probably won’t even lose consciousness
So that’s just a tiny sampling of some of the terrible science we see in movies
But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t watch them
Hello, I’m David Chaston with Ninety at nine, brought to you by interest.co.nz.
This is where you get everything you need to know in 90 seconds at 9 o’clock, including news of strong American retail figures.
But first we start today in Europe where the European Central Bank keeps its benchmark interest rate at 0.25%. However, bank chief Mario Draghi hinted it may act soon to counter low inflation in the eurozone.
There may be the start of an ECB stimulus program as early as next month.
The Bank of England kept rates on hold but is continuing with its massive £375 billion stimulus program.
In Britain, international bank Barclays confirmed overnight that it will cut 19,000 jobs by the end of 2016, including 7,000 from its troubled investment bank.
9,000 of the total are in London.
It's a white flag for their Wall Street ambitions.
Currently 65,000 people work at that bank - soon it will be 46,000. In the US retailers there posted a 6% comparable-stores sales gain in April, the biggest increase since September 2011, as better weather and the late Easter as well as aggressive promotions attracted shoppers.
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, indicating their labor market was strengthening despite a run-up in applications in prior weeks.

I think some of the legacy companies, like I think of Sears, and some of the older companies that have been around a long time, really need to grasp these new ways of marketing, like Twitter.
Turn on TV, see CNN, and they're all twittering, I mean it's incredible.
Hey guys, it's Ted from Cyber Threat Be Gone where we take care of your cyber security risks so that you can grow your business
Listen, we had a great week last week with 1500 views on our last video and that's because of all the sharing and liking that you guys did out on every single social media site
Big thumbs up to all ya'll on helping us out
But we wanted to select one question and that one came from Tomas Mendez out of Houston Texas
And his question was, "big businesses and government agencies all have unlimited budgets and they're still hacked
How in the world can my small business get #CyberStrong?" Perfect question
We're going to give you three things today, that will help you out and understanding the best way to approach cybersecurity when your budget is a little small
The first is get some help from a cybersecurity expert to do a vulnerability assessment of your network
That is really going to give you a baseline understanding of what your risks are
That is then going to lead us to #2, which is once you get all those risks you gotta line them in rank order of which one is going to negatively affect your business, your ability to service your customers the most if you are attacked in that way
Once you have those two things, #3 is that you implement cyber security controls from top down over time
You develop that cyber strong culture over time so that you don't spend all your money and all your budget upfront with a bunch of unneeded things like hardware software anything that you can buy out there
We give you some more tips on www

com on how you can really mitigate these risks overtime and develop a strong culture
Again, a big thank you to all of our social media followers out there
I’m here in Edmonton with faith leaders from many different communities, and we’ve just had a discussion about religious freedoms in Canada
It’s a subject close to the hearts of millions of Canadians who see their faith as part of their everyday life
Many Canadians grew up with a church or a synagogue nearby, a place where they could practice their faith, build community
Many more Canadians have come to Canada looking forward to the promise of a country where they could worship and practice their religion without fear of the persecution that is too often seen in other nations around the world
The subject of our conversation today is clause 14 in omnibus Bill C-51, and the proposed changes by the Liberal government
The Liberals seek to remove a crucial section of the criminal code - one that protects religious leaders from intimidation meant to prevent them from leading worship for the communities
It also allows for charges to be pressed against those who disrupt religious services because of their intolerance
The Liberals say these protections aren’t needed
we say they're absolutely wrong
There are too many examples from around the world, and even here at home in Canada, where people are persecuted because of their faith
Removing protections for the people who help guide their faith communities will only embolden those who use the vile tactics of fear and intimidation against religions that they oppose
Conservatives want to keep Canada a welcoming place, where the freedom to worship and practice your religion as you choose is a recognized basic human right
That’s why we will unconditionally oppose this Liberal attempt to take away those protections
- Welcome to the Friday Roundup It is Friday, December 9th, 2016
And today's topic is: Am I wasting my advertising dollars? Hello everyone, I'm John Peterson with Develare And John Wanamaker once said, "Half of the money I spend on advertising is wasted
" The question is, which half? Now, John went on to found one of the first successful department stores
And he grew that into 16 stores, and those stores were eventually integrated into Macy's
And like, department stores, one of the easier ways to get traffic to visit your website, is to advertise
There are a lot of different options out there for advertising, and the Better Business Bureau is probably a good option as any, I'm a big fan of the BBB, and they also have a local directory section there
You can find plumbers, you can find electricians, and yes, you can even find web designers
Now, the question is, those visitors, we're on the Better Business Bureau website, in that local directory area, do they go from there to your site? And you can find that out by looking at Google Analytics
There's a section there called referrals, so if you dig around in there, you can find the referrals section, by the way, if you're having trouble finding that referral section, just add a comment below, I'll be happy to tell you the exact method to get there, the exact steps to get there, but if you look at that referrals area, you can find entries, and you can find entries from all different websites visiting you, it might be Facebook, it might be Twitter, and in there, you should find an entry for the BBB
And so, if they're doing you some good, if they're sending visitors your way, you'll see an entry in there from the BBB
And there will be some key stats in there, there will be stats like how long they were on your site, how many pages did these visitors typically visit, and what's the bounce rate, typically, for these visitors from the BBB? Now, the bounce rate, for those of you who don't know, without getting too much into the details, is people who come to your site, visit one page, and then, they're out of there
If they visit one page and bounce, or visit one page and go somewhere else, that affects your bounce rate
Lower numbers are better
Anyway, so if you want to determine if your advertising dollars are being well spent on the Better Business Bureau, or any other website like that, you simply go to that referrals area, that will help you determine if that 50% of your ad dollars should go to them, or another resource
The same tactic works for other directories, maybe, if you're in the Woodlands area, the Woodlands Online is pretty popular here, if you're in Katy, coveringkaty
com has a yellow pages over there, there's probably other business directories in your local region or municipality, so keep lookout for those, look for opportunities to advertise, and then track them on Google Analytics and the referrals area
This has been the Friday Roundup
I'll be reviewing the (umm) DVD version of Reign of Fire, starring Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale, with Christian Bale giving probably the worst performance of his career as far as I'm concerned
I don't rate this movie very highly
I think it's pretty hokey and pretty much a pretty forgettable throwaway (uhh) action movie
(uhh) If you don't know what it's about (uhh) it's kind of the excavation of a new tunnel in (uhh) in England uncovers an egg of a dragon which hatches and manages to breed by itself creating a world of, of dragons and basically annihilates most of (uhh) human society as they burn scorch the earth and you know and feed on the ash kind of thing
But there's you know, a rag tag groups of survivors you know, trying to fight the (stutters) the dragons and survive and (uhh) Christian Bale plays one of the survivors
Matthew McConaughey plays a American group of survivors kind of show up and the two of em basically have kind of a dominance leadership fight, while trying to fight the dragons
You know this movie is basically (stutter) designed simply around having, trying to have cool action sequences between modern jet fighters and (uhh) and ancient you know medieval era dragons and unfortunately a lot of the plot and character gets lost, you know ii that emphasis
It's just overall not a great movie
You know it's really good if you're just looking for something different or you're a huge fan of dragons, but otherwise it's honestly pretty forget (stutter) forgettable
The special feature includes, what you'd usually see in you know, a mid level type DVD like this, you know
It has a documentary on the special effects, you know the trailers
Doesn't actually have a commentary track but it has what it calls a conversation with the director, which is basically you know, a pretty short short interview that doesn't really, you know, say that much about the direction because honestly there there wasn't really much that focus on the direction in the first place you know
It's about pretty pretty average, like in general
(uhh) But you know, like I said, if you like action movies you know, pretty B rated action movies or if you're a big fan of dragons, maybe it's worth seeing
Otherwise it's it's (stutter) pretty forgettable

I also love my colleagues You can be assured in any sociology class at Ryerson that you'll get a really top notch professor.
Since I teach pop culture, there are new sort of issues and questions, and pop culture phenomenon that are emerging.
So teaching pop culture there are a lot of new sort of questions that I'm excited to tackle.
Remember when Nicolas Cage actually took interesting roles instead of just cheesy action roles where he got to exhibit absolutely no character or acting ability whatsoever? Yeah, I miss those days
The Wicker Man
A remake of a (uhh) seventies (uhh) horror (uhh) psychological thriller film is no different from his other (uhh) action films that he's done
It's just not up to par
The story line in this film falls flat
I found myself actually rooting for the character's demise
(umm) It's more comical than serious
(uhh) The acting is about the same {clears throat} Nicolas Cage serves up a big, hammy helping of his balding, cheesy smile and attempt at charisma
Doesn't work
(uhh) The only thing that really was interesting about this movie was the setting
It's set in a (uhh) small island off the coast of Oregon where a cult is (uhh) set up to (uhh) basically (uhh) (uhh) where Nicolas Cage goes to investigate a missing child
{clears throat} The scenes are really well done
The villages and the buildings have a very (uhh) a very unique take on things and it's a really cool set
This is financial adviser Patrick Munro talking about Information on Selling Annuities.
Hi
My name is Mary and today I'll be reviewing Evan Almighty, which is a movie that recently came out in movie theaters
And (umm) it's basically a sequel to Bruce Almighty
It's about this guy who, named Evan Baxter, who is newly elected to Congress, and he's a newscaster
And (umm) and he is next one that is anointed by God to (uhh) do a holy mission
So he leaves Buffalo behind and goes to (uhh) Virginia, where, with his family
And then there he gets the order from God to (umm) build an ark
So he has to go find animals
And his family is, like, incredibly confused
They don't know if he's having a midlife crisis or if he really is (umm) you know, destined for (stutter) something great
(umm) Honestly, oh, oh, yeah
And there's two different (umm) I mean, there's a bunch of different names for this movie
It's also known as Bruce Almighty two (umm) Bruce Almighty sequel, and The Passion of the Ark
But, yeah, it's about ninety minutes long
So it's not very long at all
And, honestly, it was just, it's rated PG too, but, honestly, it really wasn't that good, {laugh} in my opinion
I didn't think Bruce Almighty was that good, and Evan Almighty is the same except a little bit worse
So I would not recommend it
All right
Welcome back
This is Killfast37, and I'm reporting in once again
Now, today's review is going to be about a terrible movie called House of the Dead
It's it's (stutter) a movie adaptation from the video game House of the Dead
It was very popular back in the arcades a few years ago
Now, Uwe Boll decided to make a movie about it
And the movie didn't turn out so great
(umm) There are zombies that run and know Kung Fu
All the teenagers in the movie know how to use guns and all kinds of crazy stuff
And they all also know martial arts
There are random explosions, random gore, random violence, and random sex
It's extremely {sigh} it's hard to turn away
It's like a train wreck happening in slow motion
You want to look away, but you can't
That's how bad this movie is
I mean, if you're a fan of zombies, don't even check it out
It's just going to make you upset, like it has me
I love zombies
House of the Dead is not a good movie
Stay far away from it and burn it in coals when you do see it
It's an abomination to the film industry, and it's just, it's just (stutter) awful
Please avoid this movie at all costs
House of the Dead, I give you one star
If I could give you less, I would
This is almost as bad as Manos Hands of Fake
Well, that's all I've got to say about this movie because it's so terrible
Hey (uhh) this is a review of DOA: Dead or Alive
(umm) Probably never heard of it
(umm) It wasn't really advertised too much (uhh) probably with good reason they were probably embarrassed that they made it
It was (uhh), it's a terrible movie
It had very little plot
(umm) The action, the fighting was good I suppose but (uhh) everything else was terrible
(uhh) Well I guess (uhh) the cast was, the cast was good I liked the cast
But (uhh) not for their acting abilities, mostly and it was mostly eye candy but (umm) yeah, it was pretty bad movie I'd stay away from it
(umm) I wouldn't even rent it unless you're very, very bored but there are a lot of better movies out there and give it a two out of five
So (uhh) yeah
Hey (uhh) This is a review of Pathfinder which (umm) you've probably seen the trailer
It was awesome, and (uhh) very misleading
(uhh) You see the trailer was awesome but the movie (umm) was terrible
It was (uhh) it was terrible
(umm) The story was not (uhh) not up to par and the acting was pretty lackluster
(uhh) The CG, FX fight scenes all that, they were good but it wasn't enough to save the movie at all
(umm) But yeah it was, it was (umm) pretty bad show on their part
(umm) I would avoid it
It's it's (stutter) not entertaining at all
(umm) I'd give it a (uhh) one out of five if I could
I guess probably closer to a zero, but I guess it rounds up
so called alternative fake news media shill
The fake alternative news media is also doing it's part to rile up the sheeple, making them believe that Donald Trump is their savior, when the guy has always been a part of the establishment, as he said so himself
To prevent the next step of the illuminati master plan, people need to be in control of their emotions
If there is anger and violence, the illuminati will win, and then, the balance of the relationship between order and chaos, shall be broken
They have set the trap for the sheeple, and the sheeple fell for it
This trap, was the Trump Card
Now, the New World Order, shall rule supreme
Hi
I'm here to give you a video review of a terrible movie
Mission Impossible Two, starring Tom Cruise
Now I I've (stutter) honestly found the entire Mission Impossible movie series has been somewhat lacking
The first one had a insanely convoluted plot and was just difficult to follow
The second one was probably the best out of all three, the third one was just terrible, not even worth mentioning
This one is a hundred and twenty-three minutes long, so it's pretty long, and it follows (uhh) Tom Cruise's character as he tries to stop the deadly Chimera virus from attacking the world
Now one thing I thought was pretty cool about this movie was the technology they used called the facemaker
(umm) It allows the characters to make an exact copy of someone's face and then sneak in somewhere and then pull it off, and you never expect it until they actually pull it off
It looks really weird
(umm) But the actual movie has kind of a fun soundtrack, it was real popular at the time, had some of the more popular bands
It was really trying to jazz up the series for the teenage market I think
As you can see from the DVD cover here it's got motorcycles and fire which are two things that are are (stutter) fun in the movie, but the acting is terrible
And honestly some of the action isn't as great as it could be
So while this can be a a (stutter) slightly fun movie I would probably only give it a two out of five
So check it out if you're bored, but if you're not don't bother
Go see the original Jurassic Park instead
Hi {sigh}
Tonight I'm going to be reviewing a terrible movie called Killer Klowns From Outer Space
Now this is pretty much, I mean it's released by MGM but it was a very independent sort of movie
It was made by Orion Pictures Corporation
It's very short, only eighty-six minutes long
It's rated PG-thirteen and it is about killer clowns who are from outer space and they land in a field near a small town and they proceed to take, take (stutter) over
And the movie also follows a group of teenagers who set out to destroy the clowns and reclaim what's rightfully theirs, their hometown
But, I mean, as you can probably expect with a movie titled Killer Klowns From Outer Space the movie is just full of terrible acting and bad cinematography
It's a fun concept but they just didn't really pull it off that well
So that I would just, I would give it a two out of five
It has some funny moments but overall it's just not that great
So (uhh) if someone gives you the DVD watch it, but I wouldn't spend any money on it like I did
This was kind of a waste of money
Hi I'm Tom and I'm reviewing broken lizards Club Dread
This movie is very bad I'm giving it two out of five stars
I loved broken lizards' first two films, Puddle Cruiser and Supertroopers
They were both really, really funny
Supertroopers is one of my favorite movies and I'm really glad to know they're now making a sequel
However this movie is not anywhere on that level, it's, it's (stutter) bad in my opinion
It follows the broken lizard gang as they own a resort in the Caribbean
(uhh) And it's just not very funny
(umm) (stutter) There instead of being a cop parody, this is a horror parody and I feel there have been enough horror parodies done the past few years and this one is not very, very good
(uhh) There are some humorous taunt moments in it
But overall the story is just, you know it's just campy and it's too cliche horror parody
(umm) Supertroopers was still, very was still pretty realistic like yeah it's, it's (stutter) still comedy and it's far fetched
But this people I mean, I mean (stutter) I don't know I guess you know horror is so far fetched with people come back to life but this one is just not very good
Hi, everyone
Today I'm going to do my Expo review on this DVD movie called Final Fantasy seven
(umm) This is the two-disc special edition
So it has the movie and then it has other scenes, clips, and other games or whatever on the second disc
It came out a a (stutter) year or two after the the (stutter) Playstation game that was Final Fantasy seven, which was a great game
This DVD, however, sucks
I really didn't like it
It was all basically, it's basically the game, but you just get to watch all the scenes in a movie form
(umm) And it makes Cloud, the main character, look like a real big, like, sissy or something
He doesn't look very (umm) heroic, like I thought he would have been in the game
So I didn't really like this DVD, a waste of fifteen dollars
You could probably get it for under five dollars now, since it's so old and so bad
(umm) I definitely don't suggest this to anyone who's played the video game, because it will ruin the game for you
And it's called Final Fantasy seven
This short video is to remind us about  a new heaven and a new earth.

But not to worry, for those whose hobbies are connected to nature, like fishing, in the new heaven and the new earth  there will exist many other things that are a million times more exciting than everything that we like  and enjoy on this earth today.

The beauty and brilliance  of the new heaven and new earth will be something that cannot be painted with words  because humans have no concept of it.

Hi
Today I'm reviewing the movie Bridge to Terabithia
In this movie the main, the two main characters are young children
(uhh) one is a girl that just moved in, the other is a boy that lives close to this girl
The girl had never really made very many friends, and the boy really doesn't have that many friends either
(uhh) if you see the previews, the previews shows a lot of animation and a lot of, like (uhh) fictional characters that are in the movie
(uhh) this is, to me, this movie was a very big disappointment
(uhh) it really didn't have that many fictional characters or (stutter) they actually had every character that was shown, but they're only there for like, if you took the whole movie, maybe a minute and a half, two minutes
So, it was more, (uhh) you know, it, it (stutter) really didn't have the imaginary characters that you think the movie would have throughout the entire movie
(uhh) I was disappointed also in in the (stutter) how the movie (uhh) had a twist and it was a negative twist
And I think the kids need positive twists, not negative twists
I thought overall the movie stunk
You know, I mean it was good, but it wasn't good because of the twists it had and I'm not going to tell you what the twist was, but you'll see what it is, and I usually like to have children's movies that have happy, happy movies throughout the entire movie and not to have disappointment in the movie
The product I'm unfortunately reviewing today is Garfield the movie
Now I didn't buy this movie, I don't think anybody bought this movie
The stars of the movie, their parents wouldn't buy this movie
(umm) I won this (umm) at the second door prize something
(umm) The the (stutter) best thing I can say about this movie is that it comes in a fancy orange DVD case
(umm) They probably should have actually called the movie (uhh) Bill Murray needs a paycheck
(uhh) He does the voice of Garfield
(uhh) I don't know why (uhh) someone like Billy Murray would (uhh) slum it doing this
(umm) The other stars in the movie are Brecken Meyers and Jennifer Love Hewitt, but they're washed up it's not surprising they're in a movie like Garfield
(umm) The movie pretty much (uhh) (stutter) follows the plot of the (uhh) the daily comic
Garfield hates Mondays
Garfield loves lasagna
Garfield kicks Odie
(uhh) This movie is not funny, it's not good
CGI was stupid
(umm) I, I (stutter) really don't know if just, never see this movie please
(uhh) I can't really say much more because I think I'm going to go insane in front of this box any more
Hello, I am Matthew and I'm here to tell you about this DVD movie, Little Black Book
(umm) This is a romantic comedy
But I really didn't enjoy it that much I have to say
(umm) It wasn't very romantic
(umm) The jokes weren't really that funny
It just didn't work
(umm) The chemistry (stutter) between these two people, (umm) it just doesn't work
(umm) It was slightly choppy at times
(umm) This is definitely a chick flick, I think (umm) many teenage girls would probably enjoy it and you know, I don't really mind (umm) romantic comedies (umm) if they're good but this one just didn't work
(umm) It drug out
(umm) I couldn't wait for this movie to be over
(umm) The only thing redeeming about this (uhh) movie, was about a thirty second cameo by (umm) Gavin Rossdale, which is a rock singer
(umm) That was the only thing I liked about this movie
(umm) This is not a good movie to watch with your girlfriend
(umm) I didn't enjoy it
I'm not quite sure why this is in my video collection
(uhh) Probably because I bought it about ten years ago, or actually I probably got it for Christmas
But The Fast and the Furious starring Paul Walk, Paul Walk, Paul Walker and Vin Diesil
This is a terrible movie
(uhh) There's really not much to say
It's about people that race cars (uhh) I don't understand the whole concept of it
Okay, let's, let's (stutter) spend ten-thousand dollars on a Honda or a Toyota, something that sounds like you're about to go mow my yard
Let's put forty to fifty-thousand dollars into this car and then go racing and be like, Oh, what's up man? You've got a ten second car
No
Why don't you take your money and go buy a viper? Why don't you go buy something that's actually fast and has a lot of muscle and enough torque to actually, like, bend your little honda civic in half or something? So overall I don't understand the concept
I think it promotes high schoolers to go buy Honda Civics and make them wice wockets
But other than that it's not that great
(umm) It's really corny, you know
It was, it's, don't watch it
Zero out of five
Oh I don't wanna play
Winning's too hard
We're so good everybody wants us to win state
Yeah, well that's what they sound like in the movie with Billy Bob Thornton, Friday Night Lights
It's about Odessa Permia
I don't know if if (stutter) anybody watches, follows Texas football
Back in the early nineties Odessa Permia was, they're like the hot shots back when North Mesquite Stallions, Odessa Permia, that's what this is about except this was before the Stallions were awesome
This is back when (uhh) it was actually (uhh) Mesquite Carter, I think is what it was
But I don't know
I am not a, personally I am a all-state athlete so I, I don't understand this whole "everybody wants us to win, it's so hard" that I don't I don't, I don't (stutter) get it when people complain about stuff like that
But it's a decent movie
(uhh) I think it, I think it (stutter) spends too much time talking about the problems they have
It's not enough football
I was, when I saw this I thought it's like "oh man, it's going to be a great movie cause it's gonna be about a great football team who had a great season
" (umm) No, it's not about that
And actually it's kind of funny (uhh) not many people know their story and they actually lost in that state championship football game so it really wouldn't have surprised me when they lost cause I knew that was coming
But overall bad movie just from the simple fact that wasn't a lot of football, but if you're watching it because you want to see a drama of what it's like to see, you know, high school kids pushed to the limit for a sport, you know, and it breaks them down and, you know, even the reality of all some kids can do is play football and if they get hurt, you know, and they can't go play college they're pretty much stuck, you know, in that small Odessa town doing nothing and that's kind of sad, and I don't want to know about that stuff, because I know it exists but no reason to see it
So Friday Night Lights, one out of five

The HR Certification Institute offers a Professional in Human Resources certification, or PHR, which focuses on the technical and operational aspects of human resource practices.
Hi
Today I'll be reviewing the movie Live Free or Die Hard, which just just (stutter) came out a couple of days ago while I'm reviewing this (umm)
Basically, the the (stutter) fourth movie in the Die Hard series, The Die Hard Trilogy
It used to be a trilogy
Now, it's (uhh) four movies (umm) starring Bruce Willis, and this is (umm) talks about the story of John McClain, (uhh) NYPD Cop, now he's a detective
He's not a cop anymore
(umm) And going through all these action sequences and getting into all this trouble, I mean it's really, really action packed
The movie is around, I think two to two and a half hours long, (umm) and every minute of it is action
Just a lot of action
If you love action, this is a lot of explosions, a lot of stuff crashing, a lot of helicopters, a lot of gunfire, everything
This movie is a lot of fighting
This movie has everything
Every moment is action packed
(uhh) Basically, it goes through (umm), premise of the story is, there's this computer hacker (umm) who is trying to (uhh) like bring end of days armageddon to the United States by hacking into all like, the transportation systems, banking systems, air traffic, everything
Hacking (stutter) them and shutting them all down
The electrical systems, natural gas, heating, everything, and shutting it down
Basically, with America running on (stutter) computers, everything is run by computers
He, by way by way (stutter) of just hacking into them and shutting them down, he shut down America, basically
It's a new form of (umm) electronic (uhh) internet terrorism stuff
And here's John McClain
He's trying to (uhh) stop them
And if you've seen the commercials, they probably captured his daughter and he has to go rescue his daughter also
So it's like a personal vendetta thing and overall it's very action packed
Highly recommend this
Five stars out of five
It's a really, really good movie, (uhh) and it's pretty good story too
It's not just action only
Blow up the bad guy
Kill the bad guy
It's a good story to it (uhh)
There's a lot of action
Every moment of it
Must have cost them hundreds of millions of dollars to make
(umm) It's a very, it's a feast for the eyes
It's a very good movie, and I highly recommend it
If (stutter) especially if you liked the previous three Die Hards Die Hards (stutter), (umm) this fourth one does not disappoint at all
So I give it five out of five stars
I highly recommend you go watch Live Free or Die Hard
Hey guys I'm here with a review of one of best movies ever made, Oldboy
(umm) It's a Korean movie based off of the the Japanese mange (umm) and it's (uhh) directed by (uhh) what's his name, Park Chan-wook
(umm) It's probably the toughest movie ever
(uhh) It's about a man who gets imprisoned for fifteen years (umm) and and (stutter) this this (stutter) prison is like a business where people can like have people held for as long as they pay them for
So (umm) he's trying to find out who paid to have him imprisoned
And there's lots of twists
(uhh) Really tough fight scenes
(umm) Great acting, great story, just everything about it is pretty much perfect
(stutter) Totally five star movie
(umm) Very violent
Very just it's probably the best revenge movie ever made
South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut
I actually got this movie probably about ten years ago
It was a movie I liked to watch when I played hooky to stay home and when I was faking being or being sick
I watched this movie
It was funny at the time
As I got older this movie became less and less funny
(uhh) I can't really say South Park is stupid, but it actually is
My girlfriend loves it though
(uhh) It's just not that funny, (uhh) you know unless you like (uhh) jokes dealing with bodily functions and (uhh) little kids dropping the f bomb
Actually Cartman's kind of funny
The dealings with Cartman, that makes me smile every time
(uhh) The homosexuality between Satan and Saddam it's not very funny
It's kind of weird
(umm) I actually might need to watch this now that Saddam is actually no longer on this earth, because you can probably kind of picture Saddam being down there with Satan, you know
(umm) You know, I think that's pretty evil really
I picked up Dark Blue on the recommendation of a friend
(umm) and I must say that I was not impressed
(umm) I was not really familiar with Kurt Russell outside of a few TV movies that I'd seen on TNT or TBS and I should have taken a clue from those movies because (uhh) he just, as a lead actor he just does not carry this role
I cannot buy into him (uhh) at all
(stutter) His dialogue just comes across as cheesy
He can't deliver the one liners well
(umm) And all in all, just, I just was not entertained by this movie at all
If you're looking for (umm) a movie about corrupt cops and the battle from within, I would recommend Training Day or (umm) I like Confidential over Dark Blue (uhh) any day of the week
(umm) There are some memorable lines here, but again the acting just really didn't deliver with the kind of conviction needed to make this movie believable
It's not , it's not (stutter) a bad movie, it's just definitely not a great movie
If you've got nothing else to rent or to watch, pick this one up

Hi, this is Ron Carroll, Every business has systems, but it's my experience that most small business owners don't fully understand how to create powerful systems that dramatically improve sales, customer loyalty, quality and efficiency, and ultimately cash flow and profit.
I've seen business owners like you save many thousands of dollars by spotting hidden waste in their business and by just making a few improvements.
Developing good systems will give you the best return of any investment you make in your organization.
But you have to learn the skill.

This is a story about a small rural village that holds its annual lottery.
All of the families in the village participate and the lottery starts by one representative from each family pulling a piece of paper from a box.
A man named Bill Hutchinson has pulled the paper with the black dot, but his wife, Tessie, objects, saying that he didn’t have enough time to pick.
Despite her protest, each member of the Hutchinson family, five in total, is required to pull slips of paper out of the box again to see who gets the black spot.
In the end, Mrs. Hutchinson gets the black spot and is stoned to death as per tradition of the lottery.
As always, a lot can be said about this story, but what draws my interest and attention is the idea that sometimes traditions can be dangerous in hindering progress and growth.
This is not to say that traditions are all bad and that we should always try to invent new customs.
Traditions serve an important role in our society.
Holidays, for instance, remind us of family and continually slow people down from their busy lives and schedules.
But as society changes, traditions should look to evolve instead of staying stagnant.
This means taking select qualities of the old tradition and incorporating new ideas.
The identity of the tradition is not something else entirely, just modified.
In the story, Old Man Warner is against change, even though other towns have stopped doing the lottery.
He represents the ideology that current tradition is the best and that if it isn’t broken, don’t fix it.
I would recommend you pick GCSE IT because I've done it Year 10 and 11 and now I'm doing it for A-Level.
This is a story about a boy who is fishing in McElligot’s Pool, a small hole in the countryside that is polluted with trash.
Even a local farmer asks the boy why he’s fishing there since nothing comes out of the pool.
The boy explains that while McElligot’s Pool isn’t the best place to fish, the pool might be connected to the open sea through underground channels, which opens the possibility that anything could be in the pool.
The boy continues to describe the different types of fish that might visit McElligot’s Pool.
In the end, after finishing explaining why he fishes in the Pool, the boy waits patiently.
As always, a lot can be said about this story, but what draws my interest and attention is the idea of the power of the word “Might” and ultimately the power of hope.
Throughout the story, the boy uses “might” quite a bit when describing the different types of fish that could be connected to McElligot’s Pool.
And this is important because he’s not saying that it’s so, but the boy does defend that it is possible, though not likely.
It’s this chance that these things could happen that drives the boy to further wait for something to bite on his fishing line.
But even if McElligot’s Pool is only what it appears to be - a small hole in the ground - is it good for the boy to be wishfully thinking that he might catch fish?
Of course it is.
Some might argue that he is wasting his time or building false hope that will eventually crush him later because of big expectations, but that’s not the case here.

The Socialist Party of Ontario truly believes that it is never too late to write the future.
These are three issues that we'd focus on: eliminating poverty, beginning with raising social assistance rates, and increasing the minimum wage to above poverty levels.
We believe strongly that a free transit system would open cities and get people out of their cars, thus reducing the impact of fossil fuels on the environment.
Several other cities across the world have already adapted the three transit- free zone initiative.
There is no reason why we shouldn't implement this in Ontario.
Hi everyone, Aquaman here with Water Wisdom sponsored by WaterFilters.NET.
Today's product is Pro Res Care from Pro Products.
What you have here is a resin cleaner, a water softener resin cleaner.
This is a liquid form, and it is poured into a drip feed mechanism.
It kind of reminds me of those really old fashioned toilet bowl blue cleaner things you hook on the side of the toilet bowl.
It's not unlike that, and it hooks on the side of your brine well where the salt goes, and you pour this into that, and then that drip feeds one ounce of the Res Care liquid into the salt every day.
It's the continuous maintenance cleaner for your resin.
Now to understand why you need this, and seriously every water softener should be using this product.
If you’re not, you’re losing out on efficiency, and longevity, in your water softener.
Here's what's happening.

It is convenient for the idea to get some good energy from the surroundings and then this energy waters the idea and develops it until it becomes self-sustainable

Hi I'm Kendra Martin with M R C.
DAVID BELL: What I'm most interested right now is in how internet retailers acquire customers.
And one thing we know from traditional retailing is it's all about location.
So location, location, location-- three most important variables in retailing.
But there, we're talking about the location of the store.
And on the internet, what I'm finding is that picture gets reversed a little bit.
It's still about location, but now it's about how the location of existing customers compares to location of potential customers.
So what that means if you can sort of get a groundswell of demand going in a particular neighborhood, that can really take off.
So being able to see the right locations becomes very important.
Online word of mouth is also very effective, but it's not as effective as offline word of mouth.

DR. CHRIS MANGO: Hi.
This is Dr. Chris Mango here in New York City.
On behalf of Expert Village, we're going to be taking a look at trigger points today.
In the last few days, Iran has shown again why it can’t be trusted.
Iran insists on maintaining its formidable nuclear capabilities with which it could produce nuclear weapons.
Iran insists on removing all sanctions immediately.
And Iran refuses to allow effective inspections of all its suspect facilities.
At the same time, Iran continues its unbridled aggression in the region and its terrorism throughout the world.
So let me reiterate again the two main components of the alternative to this bad deal:  First, instead of allowing Iran to preserve and develop its nuclear capabilities,  a better deal would significantly roll back these capabilities – for example,  by shutting down the illicit underground facilities that Iran concealed for years from the international community.
Hi, this is Jim Goettler on behalf of Expert Village and this is a video series about managing a political campaign, be it a campaign for public office or a campaign for an initiative.
Most staffs for a political campaign can be divided into three areas.
You need to think in these three areas what help you're long range planning for the campaign.
One is to think in terms of media group.
Can people who will be working with the media know how to pitch stories and write in a manner that's acceptable to the media.

And I've been working out of my home for the longest time

Like there is no definition, distinction between my personal life and work
And I'm growing, I'm hiring people
I now have staff and I'm moving into an office
And I'm going to share that with you guys here on my channel
But I wanted to backtrack because all of this change and growth is happening and it's really challenging my faith and what I believe
What’s the secret to a happy marriage these days?
Separate bedrooms.&nbsp;The common wisdom has been that there’s trouble in paradise if couples sleep apart.
New figures show that nearly 40-percent of couples sleep in separate beds or bedrooms; and they couldn’t be happier, because it means they get a good night’s sleep.
Science backs it up, too.&nbsp;The study had couples sleep together one night and solo the next while researchers measured their brain waves to assess sleep quality.
The result?
Couples said&nbsp;they slept better with their partner, but&nbsp;their brain waves showed they were constantly awakened by their partner’s sounds or movements and never reached the deeper, more restful stages of sleep.
More research backs up those findings.

One Frequently Asked Question that I get most often is "Where is our stuff made and how does it compare?" Our stuff is made in Dongwan China.
It's a hotbed of suppliers and all the parts that go in there.
So it's a really great place for speakers to be made.
Many people have them made there.

Hi Everyone, welcome to Jonny's Daily Dose of Inspiration!
I'm at, I'm sorry, I'm sorry I haven't been around!
Bet you missed me, right?
Well I just wanted to say uhh, I have a lot of exciting projects that I'm doing right now, and huh it's, it's a lot of fun and exciting things, uhh projects; and I'm really looking forward to finishing them and and having a good time with them.
- A very important factor to me when I was applying to colleges was the financial aid that I would be receiving.
So some of the private schools I was applying to offered full coverage, and I knew I definitely needed that one, so that was the most important one for me.

Hi my name is Pat Goodwin with patgoodwinassociates.com.
Today we are going to talk about how to write job application letters.
Job application letters are very important when you are obviously applying for a job.
The importance comes from several things.
You want to make sure that your letter is very accurate, there are absolutely no misspelled words, that you are focusing on the job that you are applying for.
So here are some components that I would suggest that you use in writing a letter specific for a job application.

Well, at least for a period of the day
So, tonight, in celebration of the many wonders of childhood, I would like to share with you a poem that I have written, titled "Oh, the Places We've Been
" Inspired, of course, by Dr



To celebrate our successes to shout hip hip hooray
We have faced our hard moments, we have given it our all
where individual started in garages, where ideas were born
Where did Microsoft, where did Apple, where did Amazon, where did Google, where did Facebook come from
They came from ideas that people felt something could be done, and that they could make a difference
I probably would not have returned to India, except my grandmother fell ill
So I came back because she was ill
Had I stayed in the United States, my life probably would have been very different
I was very happy there and very comfortable
So the crowd of twenty, thirty thousand people came down to Potočari, where the Dutch base was located from Srebrenica on 11 July, afternoon.
People came down because they thought that the Serbs were coming to kill them.
I realized that the only way to survive was to remain on the compound for as long as possible with the Dutch.
I was there with my family in the room when three Dutchbat soldiers came, looked at my family and at me, and they told me, "Hasan, tell your family that they have to leave the compound." And I knew I could stay because I had the contract with United Nations so the Dutch could not throw me out of the base.
I was trying to convince the UN, I mean the Dutch and the UNMOs to allow my brother to stay at least.
Hi how are you doing their, Stirling McAuliffe here chances are you landed on this video searching for a conventional loan if you didn't catch my first video
I went over the four main product types along with her down payments and seller's concession in this video we're going to take a look into the conventional loan for a single-family home so if you see here we have a minimum down payment of three percent now that is if you are a first time homebuyer or have not had a property interest in a home in the past three years you can qualify for that three percent otherwise you're looking at a five percent down payment at minimum and then we have a three percent seller's concession now that's if you're putting anywhere from three percent to ten percent down if you put ten percent to twenty percent down the seller's concession goes up to six percent and any more than twenty percent it goes all the way up to nine percent that's a great feature of the conventional loan we have a minimum FICO score here of 620 gift funds get funds are allowed and two months of reserves so that means two months of a pity payment or mortgage Payment principal interest taxes and insurance so that's after your down payment and closing costs you're going to need to have at least two months of mortgage payment for reserves and then your mortgage insurance varies now what's great about the conventional loan is that the mortgage insurance goes away after you pay down twenty-two percent of the home so you have a seventy-eight percent LTV or once you have to twenty percent mark you can get your home assessed our appraised and if there's enough equity in the home they will take away the mortgage insurance or you can just put twenty percent down to begin with and not have to worry about it but very small fee to get into a home
All right I hope you like this video if you did please hit the like button below if you think that you have a friend out there who could find value in this video please go ahead and share it with them i'll have more videos coming up about different types of conventional loans in regards to investment properties second homes and other homes as well so please give me a call my numbers below my email is below as well you have any questions or concern
&gt;&gt; I'm Nancy Knowlton, the CEO of Smart Technologies and I believe role models are incredibly important for particularly women here in the Middle East.
I think that it's challenging enough for people, young people to figure out a career today, but maybe more so for young women where they haven't had such strong participation, particularly in business or perhaps science.
DAVID KIDDER: There's a new authenticity that's arrived in the marketplace.
And some companies have recognized this, and some have not.
Since the current fashion seems to be for making abject public apologies for harmless offhand remarks, I have an apology I'd like to make.
It's a bit embarrassing, but sometimes a person just has to do the right thing.
As most people know, British establishment politicians will go to the most humiliating and revealing lengths to derail or to sabotage democracy in order to keep us imprisoned in a money-sucking anti-democratic federal dictatorship against our will.
And recently I was listening to a typical speech from David Cameron on the European Union, and I happened to remark that, typically, it was almost as full of weasel words as a typical speech from Miliband or Clegg, the other two losers - I mean leaders.
However, on reflection I've realised that to call them weasel words is actually a gross and unforgivable insult to weasels, for which I now apologise unreservedly.
I also apologise to any stoats, ferrets, or polecats who may have felt included in the insult, but not to parliamentary polecats, obviously.
I don't apologise to them.
Oh no.
I've done it again now, haven't I?
Mallika Sarabhai MALLIKA: First of all you have to look at the economy and our own happiness and the environment as competing for it as a no-no, and while the going was good, a lot of business was looking at it that way, that they could make a profit and it didn't matter that the environment was being destroyed.
And it's only after this downturn that people are even asking these questions, it is [ INAUDIBLE  ] asking these questions.
I agree with this that it has to be something that goes side-by-side and not something that is if this wins, this looses, because it can't be.
Hi, I am Frank and today’s topic is “SAP C_THR12_66 exam and its preparation” first of all I will discuss about C_THR12_66 exam related skills and technologies.
Afterwards I will share my personal experience how you can reduce your chances of failure in SAP C_THR12_66 exam which is related to “SAP ERP” and credits towards “SAP Certified Application Associate Human Capital Management” Certification.
Let’s get started This exam verifies that the candidate has proven skills and fundamental knowledge in the area of the SAP Human Capital Management.

This exam validates the ability to Configure the master data elements required for Organizational Management.
at the speed to interviewer might ask you it at and then I'll say it slower so that if you didn't understand it the first time, you can try to understand at a slower speed first
Then I'll ask you the same question but phrased in a different way
so, there's obviously lots of words in the English language and they all have similar means, like school, college university
It's good to know all of these words so that when the interview asks you that, you'll be able to understand it and respond back accordingly
So, let's go ahead and get started
Question 1: What are you going to study
It could also be asked: What's your major
So impact investing is investing to make social change using something other than a grant
So it could be a loan, it could be an equity investment, it could be a guarantee, there's lots of ways you can structure it
The way I like to think about it is, can you broaden your tool chest chest beyond grant-making but still be thinking philanthropically about the kind of investment that you're making
So, impact investment should not be seen as a substitute for philanthropy, but rather an additional thing that you can do
And obviously the difference is when you make a grant you give money, hopefully something very good happens in the world
But if that thing needs to happen again you or somebody else needs to give another grant
At its best what you can do with an impact investment is deploy that capital, that capital can be used by either nonprofit or for-profit to do the work that they do
But then that capital can be recycled and so hopefully they will not always need another grant another grant to keep on doing the good work that they do
Yeah so what Acumen does is we are investing in entrepreneurial solutions to poverty
We do that primarily by investing in early-stage companies that serve poor customers, and also investing in leaders who we think and make a difference in the world
So terms of transfer impact investing it's definitely growing a lot, there's a lot of interest, a lot of banks are coming into it, you see a lot of philanthropists who want to find ways to do impact investments overall
And so what we see is, a new products being created, new opportunities, but most of it is still it's still early days I would say, and so you can look to your financial advisor, you can look to your philanthropic advisor, for opportunities that they may have for you to get involved
You know I strongly believe that philanthropy is about expressing your passion, expressing your view for what the world can be, and from what I've seen it's really important for people to keep that connection and keep that flame lit
So obviously you can give, but my advice would be to always stay close to the work
Stay close to the people who are trying to help, are not only for your own motivation, but because you'll learn and through that connection more change will happen
Whether that's deploying your skills or finding new ways to get involved
The gentleman named Bryan Stevenson who has founded Equal Justice Initiative, a top piece of advice that I've heard him give which I really embrace is to get proximate to a problem
So many of the challenges in the world today are because there's so much separation, and it's up to each of us individually to overcome that separation
So what I try to do and what I see the best philanthropist doing is overcoming those boundaries
Alright, the next thing you need to remember when you're using humor, especially a joke, but it could also be and anecdote a funny story, you must keep your eyes on your audience, when you're talking about the humor.
I'm looking at you, I'm telling the joke.
My name is Julie Asti.
I'm a Certified Financial Planner with Asti Financial Management, and today I'm going to talk about how to determine the fair market value of items that you may be giving to charity.
The IRS has changed its rules in the last few years, requiring much more documentation for any amounts, excuse me, for any items that you're going to be donating to charity.
There are a couple of ways to determine the fair market value.
For household items, electronics, furnishings, baby good, things like that that you would be donating to a Goodwill or a Salvation Army, you can determine the fair market value of those by looking at various sites online and just trying to find out what - what an item of the approximate age and condition would be selling for.

Starting in the 1970s, Federal grants allowed me to study natural fracking in gas shales
During that period of time, I learned how the fracking process occurred with the help of one of the world's most unsophisticated scientific instruments: a simple piece of chalk
Okay, at this point now that we have basically--you've introduced yourself and you've talked about what a great inspiration the couple is--this is where we're going to take just a teeny tiny short walk down memory lane.
Now, traditionally you share one cute story.
Now, if you've sat down and there's two cute stories or maybe even three and you just, there all so darn cute you can't decide between them, you can tell all of them.
If I was trying to inspire future entrepreneurs out there I would tell them to do it now and not wait until the situation is perfect.
That's what I did, I started my first company when I was 25, my wife was pregnant, and we had no money so it does work out, you just have to do it.
Just to do, act, a lot of people have ideas and they think it could be great and do this and that and very few people kinda get off their butt and actually do it, so it's taking action, any step is you know, a step forward.
The one piece of advise I would give is to document everything talk with your attorney and get everything legal.
If you're just doing it for the money you're never going to be as successful as if it's a change you wanna see in the world.
Meet as many people as possible establish relationships you'll learn from every relationship you make.
Being that I was an accounting major I would say definitely understand accounting.
It's incredibly important for anything you do in business so even if you're not interested at least have a foundation in it.
Hi, to YouTube fraternity, nice sitting and chatting with you.
And, I think the question really has a very natural answer - businesses, governments, political leaders - have to come together to address their climate-change issues.
Through the 1990s and the early 2000s, the emerging nations were doing extraordinarily well, exporting a lot of goods to Western countries like America.
And that, potentially was playing havoc with their currencies because the more goods they sold the more these western  countries had to buy the currency of these emerging nations.
And the more that currency was likely to rise, which would mean those products would get too expense.
So what countries like China did in particular was to convert this currency into an asset and to buy assets from the very countries who are buying their own goods in a kind of virtuous circle.
So China started amassing hundreds of billions of dollars of American debt, for example, using, dollars.
And that meant that America could keep buying cheap Chinese goods.
Now of course in doing that, they provided America and indirectly, other nations, in the developed part of the world, with a lot of money at very low interest rates.
Because a lot of money was available.
So they didn't have to offer too much interest rates as governments to be able to sell that debt.
So, with low interest rates, we got a stimulus to the economies of the West, in a way which is truly unsustainable.
So the buying of houses was cheaper than it should have been.
The hiring of staff, cheaper than it should have been.
Building factories, cheaper than it should have been.
simplified but it makes it easy to understand the concept which means that if you do fall sick or you can't work, you'd still get 1% of 99 people's sales effort

Hi, I'm Attorney Andre' Ramsay, your workers compensation attorney.
Now Georgia workers compensation insurance typically covers employees of employers, meaning you're someone that works there on an everyday basis.
You're getting paid by the company.
They tell you what to do and how to do it.
But what if you're an independent contractor?
Well sometimes we could still get those benefits that you deserve, simply just titling you as an independent contractor doesn't relieve the employer from all liability they have if you're injured at work.
There's certain things that you need to consider when you're an independent contractor.
Do you use your own tools or do they provide you with tools?
Do they tell you when to come into work or do you set your own schedule?
Hello, this week's lecture is given by Zack Moir and Richard Worth.
Zach is a teaching fellow in the Reid School of Music at the University of Edinburgh.
He has a strong research interest in music pedagogy, in higher education.
He also has interest in musical improvisation, popular music and the musical experience of cochlear implant users.
He's also an active musician and composer.
Richard has a PhD in composition from the University of Edinburgh, and is also a teaching fellow here.
Throughout the 90s, he lived in New York, performing and recording with his band, Groove Collective.
Since then, he's lived in Scotland, studying and teaching.
In this first lecture, we're going to start with music at it's most basic level, sound.
We will look at how music can be created by exploiting the relationships between sounds.
As we're interested here in music literacy as well as theory, we will be looking at how written notation can graphically represent these musical sounds.
Now, as is this is the first lecture, there's just one thing I want to underline here before we start.
All kinds of superb musicians get by just fine without reading or writing music.
Being able to read and write musical notation does not make you a composer or a musician any more than not being able to read and write means you can't compose or play.
Understanding musical notation doesn't necessarily even make you a better musician.
Hi this is Rhett Reiger from White Caspian Studios on behalf of Expert Village.
We're talking about preproduction in directing the independent feature film.
Preproduction is vital in the success of a movie and there are many different aspects of preproduction.
Now some of the advantages of manuscript presentation, speaking, one, you can control the timing exactly.
You've been given 17 minutes or you've been given 9 minutes, or 12 minutes, or whatever it is.
You have written that speech accordingly to your time limit.
You have practiced it and you know that it fits exactly in the time frame.
This is Dr. Charles Grimes and I'm talking on behalf of Expert Village about rehearsing a monologue.
Let's think about introducing variety into how you're rehearsing your monologue.
Specifically, let's think about rehearsing the opposite way than you've just been doing it.
Are you interested in three tips that will help you build a strong foundation for a legal nurse consulting practice?
My name is Pat Iyer.
In 1987 I began reviewing cases as an expert witness and in 1989 I began building a solid foundation for a legal nurse consulting business.
Here are three principles of a successful legal nurse consulting business.
First, recognize that you need a solid foundation in clinical nursing to be able to work most effectively with attorneys.
Understanding how the health care system runs is invaluable when you're helping attorneys.
Nurses who have experience only in non-clinical roles are going to find it tough to perform some aspects of legal nurse consulting.
Secondly, be aware of the advantages and disadvantages up working on cases for attorneys who could swamp your firm with volume.
For example, a multi-district litigation case could become an elephant that takes over the time that you would have had for attorneys who send you one case at the time.
I learned this the hard way when we worked on pedicle plates and screws cases.
Our regular clients noticed the longer turnaround time for their cases.
We were on a continuous treadmill churning out reports and were relieved when the cases finally wound down.
Lastly, never stop marketing.
Your primary client could have a suddenchange in practice due to a change in the law or could leave the farm or drop dead.
At one point I got thirty percent of my income from one law firm.
It would have been tempting to sit back and relax but I never stopped a marketing.
Hey guys today I want to talk to you about Smiley360. Short and simple it's a community of people that review different products brands.
And it's all free.
They just ask that you share your experience with that brand or product and tell your friends about it.
And the more offers you complete the more points you get and that also leads to more products that you get to try.
I found that most things you actually get from Smiley 360 are the actual product rather than a  free small sample.
My name's Adam Johnson and like a lot of people I started to experience serious hair loss about eight years ago.
It was slow at first I hadn't really thought anything of it until I noticed my hairline starting to recede and my hair was considerably thinner than it used to be.
So I talked to my doctor about it and he said "well it's probably just genetics and there is nothing we can do about it". That certainly didn't make me feel any better.
I just looked awful without my hair so I decided it was time to fix this!
I was surfing online I noticed a website that talked about a product named Hair Again.
So I read through the information and I thought "hey, there is nothing to lose by trying it there's even a money back guarantee". And when i received the information I devoured it because it made so much sense to me.
After all this hair loss was reversible and it was never my fault.
I followed the instructions closely and after a few weeks the hair loss actually stopped.
Then as if by some miracle I noticed to my hair seem to start becoming thicker like it used to be and now here I am today with a full head of hair and a smile on my face.
Thanks to Hair Again.
Andy Byford: Hello, I’m Andy Byford I’m the Chief Executive Officer of the Toronto Transit Commission.
I just want to say sorry for the poor subway service that we offered last night Monday the 18th of March.
Let me explain what happened.
Just as the evening peak was building we had two fire alerts, one at Eglinton, one at Keele station.
Now in such circumstances we put safety first, we don’t take any risks.
The service is suspended while we await the Toronto Fire Service to give us the all clear that we can resume services, and around the same time we had a number of passenger alarms, then there was a further incident at Dupont station in which the doors were opened in the tunnel while the train was stationary by a staff member and clearly we’re looking into how that could have happened.

Hi, I'm Skip Waskin, I'm here in Port au Prince Haiti and I'm pleased to be speaking on World Humanitarian Day.
I'm the Director of our Office of Response Coordination here, which is coordinating USAID's response to the terrible earthquake that struck Haiti in January.
We're about seven months past the earthquake now.
I've been here for two months, and I must say I'm impressed by two things.
One has been the enormous magnitude of this catastrophe.
It's literally unimaginable--perhaps indeed unprecedented--in the history of the Western Hemisphere.
This is a situation where hundreds of thousands of people--three percent of the country--lost their lives, where much of the government was decimated, and it's a country that was starting in very poor circumstances in the first place.
PwC's Health Research Institute has warned healthcare firms and organizations that they will need to act fast now that the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Act.
PwC HRI Director Benjamin Isgur emphasized that organizations can no longer wait and see if the Act will take effect.
"As the law moves forward, it's game on for those organizations that were sitting on the fence.
It's now time for them to move forward.
So because I was looking for a team and not someone for a specific task, I didn't do any programming skills tests or any other things like that that you can really quantify the result.
I gave a few companies the same exact project that I had ability to evaluate myself.
It was a reporting project.
I wanted them to connect all kinds of data sources to one dashboard, and I told them that's what I need.
JENN MCCLAIN: A recommendation I would give retailers right now is focusing on your core customer.
The most fundamental of your considerations in marketing a product is the simple who, what, when, how, and why.
I'm Peggy Collins and I'm going to tell you some factors to considering marketing a product.
Welcome to the end of week two.
My name's Anthony Cosgrove and I'm one of the educators on this British Council course about Magna Carta.
We've had lots of interesting discussions this week and again it's been great to see so many of you taking part.
We've heard about lots of countries and their struggles for independence especially around South Asia and in Europe.
We've enjoyed good discussions about the the American Declaration of Independence with its famous line that 'All men are created equal' which students such as Robin Spencer and many others have had lots of good critical insights about.
Several of you have also nominated somebody who has fought for the freedom of their country, María Gema Grande Sosa nominated Lech Walesa from Poland, Nang Sandar Myint and many others from Burma nominated Aung San Suu Kyi and Zainab Abdul Maroof nominated Jinnah in Pakistan and we've had many other nominations as well.
But the video also prompted discussion about other subjects as well, such as language variety in English and other languages and Daniel Kutzev, Michele Patel, Dolors Gea Valor and many others have had great discussions with lots of things to say about that.
We've looked at some language this week, phrasal verbs in particular such as 'stick up for someone', 'look out for someone' and 'get round to doing something' and again lots of you have had lovely examples.
Godelieve Ashworth for example said that she has to put up with her husband's snoring and that this has done her out of many hours of sleep over the years.
Thank you for that Godelieve, we all enjoyed your comments!
perfectly natural and normal, and maybe the biggest thing that will hold you back is when you're afraid of making them
So, go ahead and practice, make as many mistakes as you can, and that's the best way to learn
So, relax enjoy the process and English only gets easier
to your supplier that is valid in the states where the delivery occurs and you will be required to obtain a certificate from your customer in the delivery state
To minimize this second risk, you must be proactive in obtaining valid documentation at the time of the sale
The third area putting multistate companies at risk is the use of incorrect tax rules being applied to the goods and services they sell
Hundreds of changes occur each year, some changes are legislative and are well published
But other changes come from court cases, rulings and regulations which may go unnoticed
Many of these sales tax changes are subtle and may post little risk to your business
Other changes can be significant and create a material financial risk for your company if you are not updating your sales-tax rules properly
My school's conservative uniform does not keep me safe &nbsp

your rant, if you personally don't believe that there's anything exciting to talk about and I know a number of people that do genuinely believe that

you'll be surprised what other people are interested in

Congratulations, you've finished lesson 2. In this lesson, you created a Git repository and added commits to it for the first time.
You also learned to use the staging area to control exactly what changes go into each commit.
Hi, my name's Corey Walker, and I am an Iowa workers' compensation attorney whose been practicing work comp.
law here here in Iowa since 1997. Today's topic is going to be independent medical examinations.
There's basically two different types of these, the first one is when the insurance company says 'hey we want to send you for an independent medical examination' but make no bones about it, these are rarely independent when its the insurance company that is scheduling these.
There are some points and tips that I can give you when dealing with the independent medical examination requested by the insurance company.
In fact, I don't call them an independent because it is a defense medical examination.
No independent party picked that doctor.
In fact, the defendants, the insurance company and or your employer has picked that doctor.
So there's definitely some things you need to look out for when they are scheduling one of those types of examinations.
They want to find out, they ask people that's fine, you should give the correct answer then
But in the buildup to an election what's happening is that you're getting called on the phone and being asked to give away your valuable personal information
Remember the uproar when Facebook starting messing with their privacy settings
Your personal information is valuable
The polls collect that, bundle it, and sell it for massive profits so that politicians can lie to you better
The whole reason that you get sort of Etch-O-Sketch politics, that was the quote out of Romney's campaign that between the primaries and the main election, you just shake it up and start over with the new message
Politicians can do that because they have faith that the polls are accurate
If the polls tell them the right lie, then all they have to do is always give the right lie
Now the next thing that you want to avoid, and I'm going to go ahead and tell you right up front before I tell you what it is, very hard not to do.
And what that is are uh, err, uh, um.
This is the hardest thing to stop doing as a public speaker.
And the reason is is because it's habitual.
Hi, Mike Johnson at Vexxt Business Growth.
I was talking to someone today.
They have an ice cream franchise, and one of the things they've seen go up in terms of pricing this year are the cost of pecans.
I think they said they doubled on the box of pecans they get for their various ice cream dishes and so forth.
And they were looking at ways they could change their pricing.
Do they change the pricing all across the board, or do they just add a surcharge for things that use the pecans?
&gt;&gt;I'm Andrew Ross Sorkin for the New York Times here in Davos, Switzerland, on day two of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.
You know, one of the issues that keeps coming up, and we're hearing it over and over again is this question about capitalism, this question is about free market, especially as so many world leaders, politicians, executives, regulators from around the world look at the experience of the United States and the financial crisis in particular.
You know, a CEO from India said to me the other day, you know, for the past 20, 30 years we looked at the U.S.
as the bastion of capitalism, the example that we hoped to be.
And we made that bet, as he said, he took all that -- he said his country took of its chips and moved them from black to red on the roulette table.
But now we're looking at the experience you had in the U.S., and we're saying, maybe we made the wrong bet.
How well do YOU know "You-Know-Who"? Well for one thing, you probably don't even know his NAME... Voldemort may as well be Vol de mort, which means "Flight from death" in French.
When we dig deeper into language, it enriches our entire experience of life.
Whether it's something as simple as reading a Harry Potter novel or our day-to-day communication.
And, in our modern, globalised, internet-enabled world, that day-to-day communication can involve the entire planet!
Isn't that amazing?! ...And at the same time... Over the last three years a third fewer students have enrolled in non-European language degrees at British universities.
Language doesn't just have a utilitarian value - it isn't just the tool with which we communicate with one another.

PwC Chairman Bob Moritz remains optimistic about the United States economy.
Thank you for joining us for The Tradex Foods - "3-Minute Sustainability Recap" -A summary of hot news items in sustainability – for seafood purchasers and industry.
-The following information is a rundown of key sustainability news items for the month of September.
-First up – Darden Restaurants and Publix Supermarkets have partnered with Sustainable Fisheries Partnership on a three-year commitment to rebuilding fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.
To start out, the retailer and restaurant group will preferentially sourcing from Grouper and Red Snapper fisheries to demonstrate support for improvements to fishery management practices and bycatch reductions.
-Sysco has committed to buying its top 10 Sysco branded wild seafood species from fisheries that are certified or currently being assessed by the Marine Stewardship Council - or are involved in fishery improvement projects with the World Wildlife Fund.
-Next up – Shaw Supermarkets is not only the first New England-based retailer to now sell fresh seafood that bears the MSC eco-label, but is also the first retailer to sell fish certified by the Gulf of Maine Research Institute.
-And in Canada, Sobeys is the first supermarket to offer customers a seafood traceability system.
The retailer has partnered with EcoTrust Canada’s ThisFish and by using the system, customers can trace seafood back to the fishermen, area and method of catch.
-Also in Canada, SeaChoice – a eco-label group – has celebrated its 5th birthday on September 27th.
-And – on September 30th – Friend of the Sea hosted an “International Certification Scheme for sustainable fishing and aquaculture products” event in the Netherlands.
The meeting educated on various issues related to sustainable seafood.
-Fish Choice has added the first aquaculture program to its sustainable seafood directory.
Taylor Shellfish and Hog Island Oysters have both been certified by Food Alliance – and are listed on Fish Choice.
&gt;&gt; What companies, governments, countries individuals can do to make the world a better place - is be honest.
That's the first step  - to actually be honest.
It's fine to make commitments, it's fine to make pledges, it's fine to say we'll do this and that, but unless it's actually executed - unless the promise is made real, then it, it's kind of pointless.
I mean it's very easy to make pledges - it's very easy to, to say we'll do this and that and never do it.
Before we talk about specific drugs and their physiological, behavioral and psychological effects.
It's important to review some of the material that we learned in lesson three, the Biology of Behavior.
First, remember that the central nervous system is comprised of the brain and the spinal cord.
You should also review the autonomic nervous system as many drugs effect both of these nervous systems as well as their functioning.
Hi everyone, I wanted to share some information about the HiSet test You may have heard of the new HiSet, or High School Equivalency Test, and have some questions about it.
That's perfectly understandable, because if you didn't graduate from high school, the HiSet could be your key to a great future.
Having a high school diploma or the equivalent is extremely important in modern America, as almost all employers now require applicants to have one, including for jobs that pay only minimum wage.
Plus, going to college is basically impossible for people without this important piece of paper.
For decades, people who hadn't finished high school had only one option, which was earning a GED, or General Equivalency Diploma.
This program was used in all states, and nearly all employers and colleges treated a GED certificate just like a high school diploma.
That is changing, though, because recently the cost of taking the GED suddenly doubled.
So dozens of states began looking for an alternative program, and that's where HiSET comes in.
It was designed to provide people with a way of showing they possess high school levels of knowledge just like the GED, but at a much lower price.
The HiSET is in many ways very similar to the GED exam, covering several different subjects that typical high school students take, such as math, reading, English, science, social studies, etc.
It will take most of the day to complete the entire exam, and the format is multiple-choice.
However, unlike the GED, the HiSet can be taken either on a computer, or with a pencil and paper.
This is really helpful, because people shouldn't be held back from improving themselves just because they don't have good computer skills.
If you'll be taking the HiSET, make sure you prepare well so that you can get a passing score and start on the road to a much better future.

DAVID ROMAN: The basics of marketing don't really change, and for any marketer coming up with a differentiated story of what your product, your brand, brings to your users is what you're going to do.
I think people look at technology in a traditional way of saying well here's another way to deliver that story, and a lot of the innovation has been through different delivery vehicles, and so on.
I don't think that really counts as innovation anymore.
I mean, that happens all the time, every day there's something new, and yesterday it was blogs, today it's Twitter, they'll be something else tomorrow, and I think those are key things to follow, but that's more part of the process of doing it.
I think the real innovations are coming more in terms of how we define what the brand really represents to our best customers.
Not all customers, but the best customers.
that are at play in your city's situation: money, of course, people, yes, ideas, information, misinformation, the threat of force, the force of norms
All of these form of power are at play
Now think about how you would activate or perhaps neutralize these various forms of power
This is not some Game of Thrones empire-level set of questions
These are questions that play out in every single place on the planet
I'll just tell you quickly about two stories drawn from recent headlines
but I do apologize for that, I could have probably handled that better
Anyways, then they come back and what do they tell me
Well, after my calculations, that's what you did, so you can nope all you want
Okay, shoving it back in my face, fair enough, because that wasn't really the most in-depth reply on my end
However, if you're gonna shove something back in my face, this is where, you don't know what you don't know
And the first faulty assumption here, $14 in fees, what, four-- Now yeah, many brokers, if you're just taking an average of seven dollars per trade, five dollars per trade, I understand where this person is getting that number from
I do, I get it
But that is not anywhere close to what I pay in fees
Hi, I’m Len Kennedy, General Counsel at the CFPB.
JMS asks why we need a new government agency for consumer protection when there are already banking regulators in place that could do the job.
That’s a great question, and it gets to the heart of the financial crisis, which was caused in part by massive consumer-protection problems.
The last decade was marked by inadequate consumer protection and irresponsible lending.
Overly complicated mortgages and other credit products were allowed to flourish.
This left many Americans in the dark about the real costs, risks and consequences of the unaffordable loans that were underwritten.
Even borrowers who avoided risky credit were harmed by it, because home values went through the roof and then fell off a cliff.
At the time, seven different federal agencies were responsible for consumer financial protection, but consumer financial protection generally wasn’t their top priority.
And none of them had the full picture of what was happening across the markets.
In other words, there was no accountable cop walking the beat.
“He was always looking and just the way he interacts with people, the way he likes to help young players is great
He came over straight away and was talking to us, saying, ‘Don’t be nervous, just play your own game’

Even when I was out on loan he was sending me text messages saying, ‘Well played’ or, ‘Keep going’
“After games when I’d scored or had done well he’d text me saying, ‘Well done’ or ‘Congratulations’
bulls eye, but you miss

And I'm here to talk about how to monitor your stock portfolio.
There are a few ways that you can monitor your stock portfolio.
If you own stocks through a brokerage account, a Morgan Stanley, a Smith Barney or even a Schwab or a Fidelity, you could access your account online and they will a listing of all of the holdings that are in your portfolio, that will be updated with market prices.
"Korean society is becoming more and more complex, thanks to the developments in science and technology, but the country's criminal landscape is also expanding

" One of the KCSI team's most prized pieces of equipment is its portable forensic lab, which allows investigators to do a preliminary analysis of the DNA samples they collect on site

The team's senior investigator says such advanced technology helps the KCSI team work more efficiently, no matter where they're called to duty
"The police started implementing basic scientific research in 1948, but the KCSI team in its modern-day form was established only in 2004
The main reason, it’s important, is actually that it exists at all When you look back to when our discussion started in the 1990s Actually there was no dialogue.
There was a series of accusations, keep in mind this was before China joined the world trade organization There were a lot of pointing fingers, China doesn’t do this, China doesn’t do that; the Chinese legal system doesn’t have this provision, that provision You’re never going to join the modern globalised economy in this situation In the mid-1990s, I once met a Chinese assistant minister of trade, who stood in front of a lunch room, a lunch event, of a hundred or so people and stuck a finger in my face, and said ‘you are the reason that we’re not in the WTO’ because I was making arguments like this The EU-China dialogue and the EU-China cooperation projects changed that At the time that I was acting director, first acting EU director of the, what we now call IPR1 in the winter of 1999, no one else was doing this People were arguing, they were negotiating about the WTO but they weren’t talking, they weren’t training, they weren’t exchanging experts.
So it’s actually a tremendous achievement that we do it at all Now the next step obviously is that you go, it’s a bit like the Olympics , you want to go higher, faster, better, or deeper or more intensely, whichever adverbs you choose.
Hey, we are working on a fabulous introduction speech.
Let me tell you something that you don't want to do.
One word: gush.
On Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed overwhelmingly with bipartisan support the medical marijuana bill that legalizes medical marijuana and gives doctors the ability to treat their patients with one more approach to healing.
I intend to sign it.
I think it's a grand step forward for Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania medicine, and certainly for the individual Pennsylvanians and their families who are suffering from so many different diseases that could be helped with medical marijuana.
On Thursday I was in Pittsburgh at the Heinz School at Carnegie Mellon to talk about government reform and really what I talked about was building on what I had been doing since I was inaugurated in the executive branch in terms of making government work better, and more democratically, and more openly.
And I want to broaden that to the rest of government, state government so that people have a reason to trust their public servants in Harrisburg.
There's a broad feeling in Harrisburg that we need to do a better job with things like the gift ban, with things like campaign finance reform, and lobbying disclosure, that kind of thing, so that we can actually get to a place where the people we serve in Harrisburg -- the citizens of Pennsylvania -- actually have confidence in their government.
On Wednesday, I was presented a budget -- a so-called budget -- by Republicans in the Senate and the House.
And it had the problem that a number of their budgets -- sort of a pattern of the past -- that the budget didn't actually add up.
ATHENA REICH: In this clip, I'm going to talk about sustainability, how to not burn out.
Auditioning, no one said it's easy and no one said it's going to be fun every day.
Sure, sometimes you get that little adrenaline thrill after an audition but honestly, nobody gets every audition that they go to.
It's just so competitive, there's so much talent, and you're just not going to be fit right.
First of all, no, that they don't always take the best auditioner; they take the person who fits the role the best, who everyone on the panel can agree on.
So, you might have two out of five people thinking you're the best and then but there's two other people who love someone else.
what does that even mean is that the prisoner that like beats up the most amount of people is that the prisoner that rapes the most
Hi I'm Laura from young writers workshops dot com.
I'm going to talk about how to write a good article summary.
So you've written an article and you want to close it really strongly.
I'm going to give you a few ideas about how to really sum up your article and give your readers a call to action.
So the first sentence of your summary you want to summarize a kind of come up with a way to encapsulate all of what you've talked about.
I think the challenge that we see in the changing face of B to B marketing starts with what has always been true, which is when you’re in a B to B, when you’re marketing to businesses, the challenge is always, how can you prove to a business that by partnering with you, that it has benefit to their business.
What we see changing is where customers are.
I'm currently looking for a B2B Marketing Manager with solid Marketo experience to work for a bespoke technology provider who build tech solutions for Financial Services, Banking and FinTech customers.
We're looking for candidates with experience within those industries, either directly or within a tech vendor.

This is where you get everything you need to know in 90 seconds at 9 o’clock, including news of some central banker blindness.
Janet Yellen gave an accomplished performance at her Senate confirmation hearings overnight in Washington DC.
Her well-established Keynesian credentials were evident, and Yellen indicated that she will continue Bernanke's easy money policy.
However, when she was questioned by senators on the issue of asset valuations, Yellen took a stance that raised eyebrows in the markets.
She said that there is “limited evidence of reach for yield” and the Fed doesn't see a “broad build-up in leverage”. Her claim that investors aren't grasping for yield is clearly debatable.
Investors lapped up the idea that QE is likely to continue for some time yet.
Yellen aside, every indicator has asset prices racing higher.

&gt;&gt;SHARON BOWMAN: Most of you don't know me.
Those of you who do may be surprised, amused or both that I am on the ballot for APA president.
I am a relatively unknown entity with the honor of being asked to fill the last spot on slate.
On July 10th, however, the Hoffman report tilted our professional world.
Suddenly, holding a spot on this slate became overwhelmingly real.
In the ensuing days and weeks, many of us have overdosed on post-Hoffman email with demands and counter-demands for change and accountability in our leadership, along with recriminations and accusations about what has happened.
Some people are convinced we need a president with high-level APA governance experience to lead APA.
I do not have that experience, not having served on council of the Board of Directors.
Instead, here's what I do offer: the outsider voice.
Being too deeply on the inside may be a detriment because sometimes we can only see what we already know.



&gt;&gt;DAMON WILLIAMS: I am the Senior Vice President and Chief Education and Youth Development Officer for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America.
In that role, I help to shape the education policy and youth development direction for more than 4,000 clubs that are part of our federated network, having an impact on more than 4 million young people across this nation.
For me, the entirety of the journey and the role into success has really been about understanding my passion, where I had potential, and ultimately what my purpose was in life.
And, for me, that's always been skewing towards those individuals who are vulnerable, helping individuals to find the pathway to empowerment, and trying to be a difference maker in the lives of those who I come into contact with.
From my beginning moments here at Miami University, where I was a student leader, where I thought and tried to be a scholar student, through to my work at other institutions, crescendoing to my current role now at Boys and Girls Clubs of America, that's been the pathway.
My liberal arts degree in Black World Studies and Sociology was essential to me in terms of helping me develop a type of critical, analytical lens that has allowed me to author numerous articles, multiple books, numerous monographs, I've lectured at more than 400 organizations around the world, and the foundation of it oftentimes will find its way back to my liberal arts experience here at Miami University.
It was here that I was really first exposed to the idea of a critique and really first exposed to the importance of having burning questions that live inside of you that you want to answer.
At the end of the day, research, scholarship, it's all about asking questions and finding answers using different methodologies to get there.
The liberal arts experience here at Miami, and specifically, the bachelor's degree in Black World Studies and Sociology, put me on that pathway.
I had incredible mentorship and connectivity with the faculty in the College, in addition to other faculty across campus, because the Black World Studies program did have an affiliated faculty group which lived in other areas of the institution.

On Monday evening, the Greek government formally submitted its proposal to the institutions... for a fair and mutually beneficial compromise, which will put an end to this crisis in Europe.
It will allow Greece to escape financial asphyxiation, as well as provide space for recovery.
It will put an end to the Grexit scenarios and, finally, it will put an end to the disaster scenarios.
So far, we have not received any comments regarding our proposal... or about any other document, from the institutional partners.
Last night I received an invitation from the President of the European Commission, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker... to go to Brussels to hold talks.
In keeping with this positive development, I responded affirmatively.
I am going to discuss the proposal of the Greek Government.

SUNDAR BHARADWAJ: The brand meaning lies in the mind of the consumers.
I would like you to consider all of your options of the schools of optometry we have, there is currently 20. I think we are all good in our own ways.
We have pros and cons with each program I think that I like students to make the decision on where to go based on their comfort with the program.
Whether it be the environment of the school or the size of the program.
We are a mid-size program here at Indiana University so we admit 75-80 students each academic year.
We are a Big 10 campus setting, like what you are used to at University of Illinois so no big surprises there, but nevertheless whatever program you are looking at we want it to be the best fit for you and cost aside or other issues that schools don’t really have any control over.
I think visiting the schools you are interested in in advance is important.
Hello, I'm Cherie Ashwood.
I'm a guidance counselor, and today I'd like to talk with you about how to get your student loans consolidated.
'Consolidated' means lumped together, and you may find that you...you have taken out student loans to...towards the benefit of your education, that what you actually have is several different loans that have been awarded to you, either each semester, or each year.
The interest rate on these loans may all be different, based on whatever the prime rates were at the time that you were awarded the loan.
There are several different companies that will offer you student loan consolidation.
Hi I am Laura from YoungWritersWorkshops.com, and I am going to talk about how to write a peer review.
Now a peer review is review of someone's performance or someone's work, and it is someone who is on your level, or a peer.
So, couture is very much so a component of high society.
It's a serious investment.
It's the same thing as people investing in paintings, for example, or a sculpture, or any other art form where they are going to spend thousands of dollars into the millions.
Couture could start at around $25,000. Per garment and go up into the millions and that's very conceivable.
We have lots of traditions that we're very proud of
One of them, for instance, for graduate students is High Table at the graduate college where faculty members like me go and present and then talk to students at dinner, at High Table
So, it's that combination of the old and the new that gives this place its special character
One of the most wonderful traditions is really the hooding ceremony
Hey, this is Ken from AES.
Sometimes we're asked about the difference between what we do and a textbook.
Let's talk about textbooks first.
The best thing about a textbook is you can buy it once and you can keep using it for three or four years.
If your school runs into financial trouble down the road you can always stretch it for that fifth year or sixth year, as long as you want to keep using it.
Of course, the biggest disadvantage of a textbook is the same as the advantage.
I see a couple trends.
What's up party people? It's Chris Derose
The Community Director of the Counterparty Foundation and today I wanted to answer the question, what is a cryptoequity? A cryptoequity is a new kind of term and we know what traditional equities are
We think that cryptoequities are going to be something pretty different
There's a lot of different definitions going around, and it's kind of up in the air so in many senses it's what we make of it at this stage, but there's a couple things that we know it is
Right off the bat we have counterparty assets
Counterparty assets are digital assets, they don't take up space per say, or they might but they aren't managed by a central authority
In some ways they're kind of parallel to what you would see perhaps in a DNS model with domain names being handled as a scarce resource by the ICAN [SP]
Of course in the case of counterparty, and of course in the case of cryptoequity, there is no central holder, or central clearing house or central repository for these equities
They exist as assets, assets themselves are up to users to define and you can call these assets whatever you'd like
In traditional equity terms, we have things like stocks so maybe you have a website venture, or maybe you have a new VC funded or Crowdfunded venture that you want to do
You can define shares, you can define the name of your company as an asset name and you can declare that to the network and you can declare that as having x number of shares
Maybe you have 1,000 shares or 100,000 shares
Maybe these are non-divisible shares, thee are non-divisible in the sense that they don't have sub-units
They are just tokens that are themselves a percentage of a a whole
Those would be a very bare bones definition of what a cryptoequity is but it goes a little bit further from there
Cryptoequities can also be things like tied to tangible goods
Maybe you have a bank of gold or copper or some such thing and you want to declare to the network that you are the holder of that repository, that it is yours but the equity itself is decentralized and it is declared on the network and it represents some fractional holding of that store of that traditional commodity
In some senses, in that case it's a bit centralized and requires trust upon the person declaring the asset but certainly is doesn't require trust on the part of the clearinghouse or the counterparty agent
That would be another use for cryptoequity, but there's more exotic definitions of cryptoequity as well
These could be things such as karma perhaps
Maybe what you do is on a reddit type site, you issue karma for people who contribute content
This content is itself a fractional share of perhaps the advertising revenue
That would also be a new form of cryptoequity and we don't really know where this is going but these are the types of things that people can start doing with counterparty, with cryptoequities and these are the types of directions that people will take
Right now there is a [inaudible 00:02:27] project, which is a bridge between the old world of equities and the new world of cryptoequities
That project is still in development, it's too soon to talk about and we will see what happens but you'll start to see the divide between equity in traditional shares and safe models and the cryptoequity model start to blur perhaps over time
What we can be certain of is that cryptoequities are decentralized
They are tied to the security of the network in terms of a cryptographic scarcity and they will be available through protocols like if not, certainly, counterparty and they will be done by people like yourselves, so go ahead and create your own cryptoequity
Show us how this is going to work in the modern world and show us what you're doing with it
In fact when you do it let us know

My name is Julie Asti and I am a Certified Financial Planner with Asti Financial Management and today I am going to talk about how to start a foundation.
If you want to start a foundation there are really two initial things that you want to consider.
First if you want it to be a private foundation or a public foundation.
A private foundation is one that is usually funded from one source.
Now, you've watched the whole tape.
You have critiqued your performance.
It is essential that you critique yourself in an honest, fair manner.
Hi I'm Sarah and my role at Aston University is to go into Sixth Forms and Colleges and speak to students about the university application process and how to write an effective personal statement.
When speaking to students, my top tip is to approach the application and the personal statement as you would any other academic essay - the hardest part is getting pen to paper and coming up with some initial thoughts.
There's loads of resources on the UCAS website which will help you to do this.
Things such... about creating a mind map and a timeline about some topics which you might want to include in the personal statement.
Once you have those initial thoughts gathered on a piece of paper, you just need to approach the structure as you would any other academic essay.
We like to see an introduction which focuses on your fundamental reason for why you're choosing that subject, why you want to study that at university... You then going to talk about your academic focus, so what knowledge you may have learned  in your year 12 and 13 subjects which has prepared you for studying at university, any extracurricular activities which much support that knowledge, so if you maybe volunteer, if you've got a part-time job, if you're a captain of a sports team - all of these extracurricular activities give you valuable transferable skills which will help you with your academic studies at university.
We would then like to see just a nice little summary to the personal statement to bring it to a close.
I'm Megan Edwards for InvestmentPitch.com PI Financial has initiated coverage on MAG Silver, symbol MAG on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Analyst Philip Ker gives the company a buy recommendation, with a speculative risk rating, and a12-month target of $9.00, a premium of 15% to the $7.80 price the day the report was issued.
MAG Silver is a silver explorer and developer with ideally situated projects located in two of Mexico's premier mineralized silver belts.
The Juanicipio property is MAG's flagship asset and lies within the prominent Fresinillo silver belt in the state of Zacatecas, which to date has produced more than 4 billion ounces of silver.
&gt;&gt; Um, will China pull us out?
Let me also stand back and remind -- I think this is an important reminder -- what the United States seeks in Syria, what we have been working for, for more than a year now: We support a unified, free, prosperous, and tolerant Syria that respects the rights of all its people and becomes a force for stability and peace in the region rather than a threat.
And no matter how the unrest in Syria ends -- and it's going to end; Assad's time will come -- it's going to take a lot of hard work for the Syrian people to rebuild their country and begin this process of political transition that gets them where they want and deserve to go, which is not a Syria that trades one tyrant for another set of tyrants, or one tyrant for a set of extremists, but a Syria that is able to make the transition to a democratic, tolerant, prosperous, unified country.
So our policy is directed, first and foremost, towards squeezing the Assad regime to end its violence, but also to support those Syrians inside and outside of the country who are working for that kind of future.
That's what our nonlethal assistance is designed to do, that's what our training is designed to do, to help Syrians unify behind these kinds of objectives -- a real transition plan to get there, new leaders who are prepared to bring Syria into that kind of future, to resist extremism, to work against it, to not allow their own fight for freedom to be hijacked.
That's what we are working on.
Hi my name is Marketa.

What will define success through the evolution of digital marketing, I think it really rests on two key tenets.
Heyi Finite Fans, Michael here with an announcement! I believe understanding how the media we consume is created makes it more enjoyable and raises the bar for quality across the board
By taking a close, thoughtful look at how great stories are told it deepens our appreciation for them
So that's why I’m excited to announce that I’m launching a new channel called Lessons from the Screenplay
With Lessons from the Screenplay, I’ll be making videos that analyze movie scripts to examine exactly how and why they are able to tell their stories so well
I want it to be a fun way to learn more about your favorite films and help us all become better storytellers
"History is an impertinence and an injury
Our religion, we have not chosen, but society has chosen for us

Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members
" We must, he argued, live from within trusting nothing but our own intuitions

nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind
This leaves open a vital question: What is your nature
once you've rid yourself of history, tradition and religion
What can be said is that it isn't necessarily self-indulgence, haterism or narcissism
Hi, this is Jim Goettler on behalf of Expert Village and this is a video series about managing a political campaign.
One of the ways to raise money for a campaign which is often overlooked is using house parties.
Now house parties can be as simple as having a video of your candidate or a video about your issue if it's an issue campaign.
Available to play in someone's home unit, you invite a bunch of friends over, you have some munchies, some food, some drink, and while people are there discussing the issue, you ask them to write a check.
It's known up front what this is all about, there's no mystery involved.
But they can also be a lot of fun because it brings people together who generally share ideas and opinions and you can have a really good time at a house party.

Hi, I'm Gerald Brady from Silicon Valley Bank, it's going to be here, and so I've been asked to give one piece of advice.
And the piece of advice I would give to entrepreneurs in Europe, particularly in Scandinavia, is to get really good at pitching, particularly to investors in America.
So nail that 30 second pitch and be really good at contributing and telling the story about what you are doing.
The last time I saw Jay was over Thanksgiving break.
He and I drove out to Wendy Parent’s house to visit the animals.
Wendy offered him a choice of four different pies  and Jay had a slice of three of them.
He cleaned up after himself,  he pet the cats, he gave Wendy a   soft five, and we were off.
MALE SPEAKER: So Volkswagen commercial is one of the coolest ads I've seen where they had a hybrid and the diesel.
FEMALE SPEAKER: Those trucks that have Ikea bedroom inside them and they're really thin and goes by and you don't realize what you're seeing and then it's, oh, it's Ikea.
FEMALE SPEAKER: Mac's done a very good job.
Their whole campaign, the Mac versus PC, it's been going on for, I don't know, quite a few years now.
And it's so simple but yet so clever.
MALE SPEAKER: I did see an advertisement from Dawn, the soap company, where they donate soap to oil spills.
They give it to people to help animals clean because supposedly it's good at cleaning oil off animals that have been affected by oil spills.
I thought that was I mean at least commendable.
It’s critical that we pay attention to what is happening to customers and prospective customers in both the B2B and B2C markets.
For one thing, they are being insulated from direct contact with a salesperson more than ever before.
Billions of dollars are spent monthly in which the entire transaction happens in cyberspace.
Both consumers and business buyers have learned to research, analyze, price, compare and purchase many of the products, services and business solutions they want online without any involvement by a salesperson.
What online marketers have learned is that their success is still largely determined by the customer buying experience and that often means how they are treated when they have a human to human encounter with either a salesperson, customer service representative or a repair person.
Without a successful emotional engagement with the customer, customers leave.
Even the very best 100 online retailers receive only an average 78% customer satisfaction rating last year.
Tens of thousands of other online businesses fare far worse.
In B2B markets more professional, educated and aggressive buyers research extensively using the Internet to fulfill more and more of their needs.
21st century B2B buyers reach out to sellers only when they are unable to satisfy their needs online.
Even then, B2B salespeople are finding that these buyers are more product and service knowledgeable and they have frequently fully researched your company before they will even talk to you.
Well, for us, you know, we are pushing messages out through many channels.
I think one of the things that’s clearly changed in the last few years is the explosion of social media and the extent to which consumers are actually participating in creating content and conversations.
And so we’re very actively monitoring, engaging and sometimes seeding conversations around our brand because people are very passionate about fitness and about their health club that they use.

So I like to create a double hang with these valets, or you can just have one long hang, for longer garments

and somebody who is signing and maybe is a little bit startled because they got pulled over
Also, remember that sign language includes facial expressions
So, sometimes it might look like someone is being aggressive, but facial expressions are just a part of sign language
Remember that some Deaf people may try to use their voice
Maybe for you, it's not sounding what is a "normal' voice
It might sound a little loud, or high-pitched
But that does not mean they're trying to be aggressive
Also, if you're encountering a Deaf person, you need to kind of recognize they're trying to indicate that they are Deaf
So that means they're Deaf

to find evidence of kangaroos, we would expect to find some fossils, some bones in the last 4,000 years
Somebody would have been hopping along there and died along the way and we’d find them
And furthermore there is a claim that there was a land bridge that allowed these animals to get from Asia all the way to the content of Australia
And that land bridge has disappeared - has disappeared in the last 4,000 years
No navigator, no diver, no US Navy submarine—no one’s ever detected any evidence of this, let alone any fossils of kangaroos
And so your expectation is not met, it doesn’t seem to hold up
Another remarkable thing I’d like everybody to consider
How's it going everyone? Matt Leighton and welcome back to another video
In this video, we're going to be talking about the top three questions you need to be asking your home inspector
I'm here in Arlington, Virginia, I have the new Discovery Elementary School behind me
It's Arlington's first new elementary school in over 10 years and it's a net-zero energy school
Meaning it doesn't consume any extra energy
It produces everything it consumes
It consumes everything it produces
You know what I'm talking about
I'll put a link in the description below so you can learn a little bit more about Discovery Elementary
Let's talk about the top three questions you need to be asking your home inspector
Question number one: what is the biggest safety issue that you're seeing? Guys, you're going to be negotiating a lot of money in the home inspection
It could be thousands of dollars, it could be hundreds of dollars, whatever the case may be, your safety is paramount

That should be your top priority
And the safety issue might be as small as a couple GFCI outlets or it might be something as large as structure damage or the entire electrical needs to be redone or something of that nature
The absolute first question you need to be asking is, 'what is the biggest safety concern?' Question number two is, 'what is the biggest monetary fix that you see?' What is the biggest monetary item out there? And this one can be a little bit tricky because the home inspector might not know the exact cost but they are certainly going to know the most significant item
That is number two
If you're buying a house or a townhouse
You might have something like 20 - 25 items come up
They could range in value from $20 up to maybe $5,000 or even $10,000
Now what I tell people is only focus on the Kevin Garnett items
Only focus on the 'big ticket' items
Items that are expensive, that are costly
Don't worry about things that are $100 or $50
Focus on the things that are thousands of dollars and tackle those first
So find out from your home inspector what their thoughts are on the most expensive items
And finally, the third thing you should be asking your home inspector is, 'Mr

Home Inspector, if this was your house that you're purchasing, what would be your top priority?'
Now this is kind of tricky because depending on how you word it, they may not be so inclined to answer
They may want to kind of excuse themselves and not get in the way of your purchase
But if you word it correctly, I think they can answer that
And I think the goal that question is to take them out of their home inspector shoes and put them into a purchaser's shoes
A purchaser mindset, sort of change the framework, change the mindset around
So now that they are no longer the inspector, they are the purchaser
And I think that would give a little bit of an insight to see what sort of issues are important
And what sort of issues were kind of just put on the report to show that they were just doing their job
Because, let's face it


If your house is perfect and there's nothing wrong with it, the home inspector is still going to find things wrong that will need to be fixed because they need to do their job and show that they are doing something for $500
Because if they give you a report that is empty, that shows everything is good
Well then you're just going to think that you wasted $500
So even if you're house is perfect, they're still going to find issues that are wrong with it
So I think those are the top three questions that you need to be asking your home inspector
Safety, monetary value, and then the third question is if they were the purchaser

Then, Fast Unsecured got into action
They were able to find 6 unsecured cards for me adding up to sixty-eight thousand five hundred dollars in credit financing one of which was from capital one for $10,000 no interest for six months
There was just no way I could've done it on my own
They also revealed to me the BIG SECRET to adding more cash out above the daily limit
These are the cards and the unsecured financing that I got from them

7% interest, Capital One $10,000 0% Interest of 6 months, American Express Delta $8,000; JP Morgan Chase $5,500, Wells Fargo, $3,000
I'm happy with Fast Unsecured
Digital has enabled us to go deeper with consumers in a number of ways.
I mean A, for the first time it’s very easy, very quick and very, frankly, more inexpensive for a consumer to raise their hand and say, “I’m interested in that idea.” To open up and give us permission to start a conversation, and that can start with dinner.
That can start with I want of know how to lose weight.
Hello, new international students and welcome!
I’m Amber Cordell, Educational Programs Manager at OISS.
I have some important reminders for you as we start our week of the International Academic Orientation Program, which we usually call IAOP.
It is important that you always have two schedules with you this week: Your IAOP schedule booklet and your personalized schedule, which you confirmed online.
You will need to show us your schedule in either printed form or on your mobile device so we can make sure you are in the right location and with the correct small group.
You must complete three orientation steps by their deadlines: The first step is the Online Spartan Preview, which you should have already completed.
If you haven’t finished it yet, please tell your group leader or a staff member who can help you.
You must complete the Spartan Preview before you can meet with an academic advisor and enroll in classes.
The 2nd step is attending all of this week’s required sessions in your assigned locations with your small group.
You will have two orientation leaders mentoring you and your other group members all week.
These student leaders have been in your shoes and have a lot of valuable experience to share with you.
Ask them lots of questions!
Make sure you exchange contact information with your group members and other new friends so you can stay in touch and spend time together after orientation.
When you come to your assigned auditorium for required presentations, we will ask you for your Spartan ID card so we can track your attendance.

Hi, this is Naud Robinson again,.. to talk to you about, Real Estate Investment Property.
The WIDEX DREAM is the best hearing aid I have ever worn.
The first day I put it on I went outside, and I could hear the difference between the beginning of a bird's chirp and the end.
The generation we live in today is a generation that will continually accuse GOD of negligence.
They see themselves as their own provision, and they would not wait upon the LORD because they have no trust in the TRUE God.
I want to read to you what it says in 2 peter 3:9 “The Lord is not slack concerning HIS promise as some men count slackness, but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that ANY should perish, but that ALL should come to repentance.” The will of the LORD JESUS is that we are patient, and are patient to call upon HIM and wait for HIS provision, and if we DO He comes through for us.
Jesus has never let me down.
For some time, just a few weeks ago I became very sick, and I was spiting up blood.
I had to take a few days off of work, and I started to wonder if I should go to the hospital, but instead I decided to call on the name of Jesus, because Jesus has never let me down.
And shortly after I prayed and my wife prayed for me I was healed.
I call on Jesus and I know HIM as my healer and my helper, but this world, this culture, this generation does not.
In this section we're going to discuss some methods you can use in dealing with tough customers.

Why would anyone walk through life satisfied with the light from the candle of their own understanding when, by reaching out to our Heavenly Father, they could experience the bright sun of spiritual knowledge that would expand their minds with wisdom and fill their souls with joy
When you and I talk to people about faith and belief, don't we often hear, "I wish I could believe the way you do"
Implied in such a statement is another of Satan's deceptions: that belief is available to some people but not to others
object to project on, yes
And as, when you realize it’s kind of you know, that even you yourself might be involved, responsible, yes
But I mean, you know, sometimes you know it’s your fault also but you get angry
But there you need your greatness, your grandness, to recognize it
If it’s your fault, say, “It’s my fault

there’s no like coming down, you know
There’s no losing dignity in that

This is Financial Adviser Patrick Munro talking about, what is a defined benefit plan.
In the area of retirement plans, companies have to offer retirement plans to retain and keep a valuable employees.
A defined benefit plan is a plan that's been approved by the IRS whereby a company can tax deduct dollars from a paycheck so their employees put it aside for their retirement.
Many times progressive employment companies will match the deductions that are taken off the employee's paychecks and further enhance their retirement.
This is financial advisor, Patrick Munro, answering the question, who qualifies for an IRA?
Well, in order to get an IRA, you must be a American citizen, gainfully employed with taxable income, and working at a job that has tax deductions, and deducted as source.
In other words, you're payroll deducted.
[Background voices] CLAIOR BEARDSON &gt;&gt; Yes, I think the environment will lose out this-in this coming years although it's an important point and everyone is very interested in it.
Um-the economy is more in the forefront and getting people out of the poverty level and giving them jobs is going to be the most important thing just for the moment.
I think it is a long-term concern and I think the interest is there and a sustainable world is the way we would want to go.

Hi with monsoons here I am going to give you a few tips on how to take care of you skin during monsoons with home made products.
Now one of the things with monsoons is that your skin is a little sticky and also you have a lot of open pores and because of the pollution and humidity you will find that your skin feels a little grey.
So what you got to do for that is make yourself a scrub which you can do at home.
Take a cup of multani mitti (fuller's earth) a cup of sandalwood powder and grate some soap into that and mix it up.
Take about half a cup of orange peel crushed up.
Keep that in your bathroom and to cleanse your face take a spoon of that mix it water and give yourself a nice scrub on face and neck.
Don't forget your neck.
Keep it on for about a minute or two and then rinse it off and see your skin glow.
This is going to definitely deal with all the dead skin pollution and the open pores.
Another thing I'd like to tell you for monsoon is that you have to keep your skin scrupulously clean and you will also have to change your cleanser.
Because if you are using a heavier cleanser you will definitely have to go for something lighter.
A face wash is excellent or you will have to use a light cleansing cream or a light cleansing lotion to clean your face.

FREDERICK BURCHELL: Hello.
My name is Frederick "Ricky B." Burchell with B4 Entertainment on behalf of Expert Village, and today we're going to talk about producing, manufacturing, marketing, and distributing your independent CD.
Now we're going to talk about digital distribution.
JOHN PEEBLES: The great thing about doing something online is the consumers are always telling you what works.
So we are big believers in multivariable testing, and that's playing a big role in how we make our decisions.
So some of the counterintuitive things that come out of that, for example, would be, because we're a very process-focused business-- in other words, you come to us to achieve a goal-- that goal usually is creating a reservation, that's our biggest one, for example.

For those not familiar with Chevron – we’re a global energy company with a market capitalization of about $150 billion.
We’re best known for our oil and gas developments in some 25 countries around the world including China.
And for our marketing of petroleum products under the brandname Chevlon, Texaco and Caltex.
I’ve been asked to lead a discussion at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin in September around the importance of company culture.
When I look at the outside world that Chevron faces today.
We know that there are high expectations from our customers, our suppliers, government and communities where we operate.
And it’s very important that a CEO establish the right kind of culture to meet those expectations in the community.
Many of you have started businesses where you focus very heavily on customers, cost, technology, and meeting the financial requirements of the business.
But to be successful over the long term.
I think it’s very important for a CEO to establish the right kind of culture, so that you get your results in the right fashion.

So let’s go through some EFT and learn how to do this practice

Right, set up, tap and right
So it’s important with EFT to make sure that you right your issue
We’ll use from zero to ten
It gives you an idea of how much you’re moving and if you’re making any improvement
Zero represents the issues gone and ten represents as the most intense it could get
Let’s take an example like a headache
Your headache is pounding, you feel tired and you have head pressure
It’s pretty intense, so let’s give it a nine out of ten


The combination of these three factors gives rise to varying degrees of market power
So, what does this mean? Well, it refers to the firm’s degree of control over price
Is the firm a price taker or can it choose its price and if so, how much would changing its price affect its profit? Sounds counterintuitive to you; think of it this way
If you are in a perfectly competitive market, you are just a small firm
You cannot set your own price
If you set your own price above the market price, people will just go to everyone else to buy their goods and since they sell same goods, everyone else and there are so many of everyone else, you won’t get anything; there are so many substitutes
So, you won’t want to set your price the lower the market price either
Why would you want to? You can earn it at the market price
But if you are a monopoly, you get to set your own price unlike the perfectly competitive firm where you take the market price because that isn’t the market dictating you
So, market power refers to the amount of power you have over prices
Market power occurs when there is less competition
So, perfectly competitive firms have zero market power whereas monopolies have lots of market power
A firm with high market power also has a very high price inelastic demand curve
For example, in monopoly we have no choice but to buy things that monopoly; there are no substitutes
Compare that to a firm which is perfectly competitive; there are so many substitutes all over the place
Jesus said some very troubling things regarding our spiritual fruit.
I want to read to you what HE said in Luke chapter 6. “A good tree does not bear bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit, for every tree is known by its own fruit, for men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.
A good man out of the good treasures of his heart brings forth good, and an evil man out of the evil treasures of his heart brings forth evil, for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.” Why this is troubling is because farmers know that a good tree might produce some bad fruit, and many Christians know that there are people in their churches, there are people who they consider brothers and sisters that also produce some bad fruit.
But Jesus said that either you need to make the tree GOOD and its fruit ALL GOOD, or you need to make the tree BAD and ALL its fruit BAD, even if it looks good, it is a deception and its fruit is really bad.

Hi Mike Johnson from Vexxt Business Growth.
ONe of the problems that retailers have is their **** becoming a commodity.
And one way to get away from that is to be outside of any kind of comparison.
You hear apples and oranges, well you've got to figure out a way to keep your items and your services and your products to keep from being compared to every others store's same selection.
And we don't want you to be a commodity either.

Hello, this is Ron Paul with your weekly update for July 25th.
Imagine you had a pesky neighbor who somehow took out a mortgage on his house in your name and by some legal trickery you were obligated to pay for it.
Imagine watching this neighbor throw drunken parties, buy expensive cars, add more rooms to the house, and hire dozens of people to wait on him hand and foot.
Imagine that he also managed to take out several credit cards in your name.
One by one, he would max them out and then use your good name and credit to obtain another credit card, then another and then another.
Each time, this neighbor would claim that he needed the new credit card to pay interest on the other maxed out credit cards.
If he defaulted on those cards, your credit score would be hurt and when you wanted to buy something for yourself, it would be more difficult to get a loan and the interest you paid would be higher.
Imagine that you mulled this over, and time after time, said nothing as he filled out more credit applications so he would not have to default on the other debt taken out in your name.
Meanwhile, another shiny new Mercedes appears in his driveway.
At what point do you think you might get tired of this game?
And, even though you are left with no really good options, do you think you might eventually tell him to go ahead and default, just stop spending your money!
This analogy demonstrates the position we are in with our government and the debt ceiling.
The government has run up a huge debt in the name of the American people, who are sick and tired of being on the hook for it.
There are no really good options left.
Defaulting on a portion of the debt may not be without costs, but it is better than handing the government yet another credit card.
The government is using the usual scare tactics to strong-arm the people into going along with more spending.
Remember the rhetoric surrounding the big bailout of October 2008? We were told, not that this would be calamitous for the banks, but for the people, who would continue to experience massive job losses and foreclosures.
We were told that the economy would sink into a deep recession if this money was not handed out to too-big-to-fail corporate cronies.
So, after much hand-wringing, leaders from both parties, against unprecedented public outcry, agreed to shower money on the banks and increase the debt.
The banks learned nothing, except that Washington will come to their rescue, no matter what.
&gt;&gt; Well, I believe the answer yes.

I want to apologize to you if I have wronged you in any way, and I want to apologize to you if I have discouraged you in any way in your faith.
The messages that I make are for people to repent of their sins and to get right with Jesus.
I preach that people repent of ALL their sins so that they may be right with Jesus and be HOLY and PURE before HIM.
I don’t want anyone to be discouraged by my message, the message of repentance, so I want to tell you that NO ONE IS PERFECT.
The devil would have you believe that you know, I just believe that I am perfect and I think that I am good and I think that you are bad, and I think everyone else out there is bad and I think that I am good… THAT’S NOT TRUE.
I don’t think that I am good.
I don’t think that I am perfect, and in fact NO ONE is GOOD and NO ONE IS PERFECT, but the condemnation that sends people to hell is NOT that we are not perfect or good, but it is that we never got right with Jesus and repented of our sins.
None of us are good and none of us our perfect, HOWEVER we CAN repent of our sins and let the LORD JESUS PURIFY US because EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE WITH JESUS, do you believe that?
Jesus loves you, and Jesus wants your soul, He is fighting for your soul because He loves you.
Jesus has NO please in ANYONE perishing in the lake of fire.
So, I apologize if I discouraged anyone by making you think that you have to be perfect on your own merit, or you have to be good on your own merit, because that is NOT what it is about.
NONE of us are perfect and none of us are good, BUT WITH JESUS ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.
So if I encourage you in anything it’s to get right with Jesus, Jesus KNOWS your heart He KNOWS if you are SERIOUS about repentance, and He knows the people who are just playing games.
Make sure that you get right with Jesus because He loves you, He cares for your soul and He finds NO pleasure in sending anyone to hell.
So go to Jesus He will accept you, He will NOT say; “You’re not perfect, you’re not good, I’m going to cast you out…” That is NOT our Heavenly Father.
He loves the whole world and He died for us that we may have eternal life.
It’s NOT by our own merit, it’s NOT by our own goodness, but it’s of how great the LORD JESUS IS.
James Schramko here with a business tip.
This is a really powerful technique for overcoming challenges.
This is called my question technique.
When Challenges Come Along When things come along, when challenges come along, firstly I don't call them problems.
I refer to them as challenges.
And the second thing is, I turn them into a question.

Now, that doesn't mean write a script, memorize it, and don't stray from it at all
It's just easy to get flustered or overwhelmed when you're surrounded by a lot of people you don't know and you're trying to meet new people
Think about it in terms of bullet points
What do you want people to get out of talking to you for 30 seconds
Obviously, your name, if where you're from is important, what you do what you're interested in doing
Think about what your end goal is in the first place of being at this conference, event, mixer, whatever
Also, look in the mirror and practice saying these things out loud
If your roommate or family or significant other or whoever you live with thinks you're crazy, just do you
&gt;&gt;Peter Norvig: Hi, I’m Peter Norvig, Director of Research at Google.
In July, Google offered a short online course, Power Searching with Google, taught by Dan Russell.
It was a big success, with over twenty thousand people completing the course.
We thought that many of you might have some topic that you're interested in teaching to an online audience, so we've packaged up the technology we used and are releasing it to the world as an open source project.
We call it: Course Builder.
If you have some topic that you want to teach, some time to devote to putting together a course, and some technical expertise at the level of a webmaster, then Course Builder is for you.
That is, you should be comfortable installing software on your computer, editing files that contain JavaScript and HTML, and fixing things when they go wrong.
Some minimal experience in JavaScript and Python would be helpful, but not strictly required.
You can see that we provide extensive documentation.
There's a section to help you get started, along with a more complete set of step-by-step instructions for downloading the code, setting up App Engine and Google Groups, and editing the course template.
CASSIE MOGILNER: I have been looking at the influence of drawing people's attention to time as a resource, as opposed to money, which has typically been the focus in marketing.
Finding that there is very beneficial effects when you draw attention to time.
And there are examples out there where there are mentions of time and money, so for instance Miller Time.
The Miller Time campaigns have been-- decades old at this point-- drawing attention to the experience that you gain while spending time with the product.
In contrast, also within the beer domain, is Stella Artois, with their "Perfection has it's price" campaign.
They are dialing up by spending a fair bit of money on the good, then you're buying this prestigious experience.
And so what I find over the course of a bunch of studies at this point, that as you simply mention time in advertising campaigns, then it's leading people to think about the experience that they're gaining with the product.
According to a new study by the Government Business Council (GBC) and Deloitte, federal government managers are considering reorganization at the agency or program level.
Despite the challenges that complicate reorganization, focus group participants still consider it worthwhile.
Hi there, Tracy Goodwin.

Now I want to talk about something else that might help you, help your audience to remember you, or a specific part of a speech, or maybe an area that's real important in your speech.
It's called a mnemonic device.
A mnemonic device is some kind of statement, some kind of jingle, some kind of rhyme that helps people remember.
An example would be when we're talking about daylight savings time, and you can't remember whether you're supposed to turn the clock forward or back; you can spring forward or fall back.
My name is Julie Asti I'm a Certified Financial Planner with Asti Financial Management and today I'm going to talk about how to avoid an IRS audit.
The first thing to know for an IRS audit is that really a relatively small percentage of returns ever get audited.
Good morning.
I am pleased to be here today with my fellow Commissioners from both the SEC and CFTC.
And, I want to thank Chairman Gensler and the CFTC for hosting this first day of joint meetings.
We look forward to continuing the dialog tomorrow at the SEC.
I would also like to extend our appreciation to our distinguished panelists who are with us to share their insights, advice, and recommendations.
We are truly grateful that so many have agreed to participate in these meetings and share their views with us.
Today's hearing will build upon the progress that both agencies have made in discussing harmonization matters, as well as designing a framework to regulate OTC derivatives.
I believe it will move us further down the road of harmonizing our regulations, which should in turn, help to increase transparency, reduce regulatory arbitrage and rebuild confidence in our markets.
As you know, the Obama Administration's financial regulatory plan laid out proposals that seek to ensure comprehensive regulation of our financial markets and that seek to fill in gaps that came to light in the wake of the financial crisis.
One important component of the Administration's white paper - and the reason that we are here today - is a recommendation that we harmonize the existing regulatory regimes for futures and securities products.
Specifically, the Administration asked our agencies to complete a report that identifies all existing differences in statutes and regulations.
Where such differences exist, we must either explain why those differences are necessary or recommend changes to those statutes and regulations.
To advance this important harmonization initiative, we, at the SEC, have been engaging in a continuing dialogue with the CFTC, and staff from both agencies have been developing a coordinated approach to this task.
They have undertaken a combined effort to complete a comprehensive evaluation of our regulatory systems to find ways to align the oversight and regulation of similar types of financial instruments.
We have made much progress.
We both recognize that enhanced coordination and cooperation concerning issues of common regulatory interest is necessary in order to protect investors, foster market innovation and fair competition and to promote efficiency in regulatory oversight.
I am confident that we will also be able to work towards the goals expressed in the Administration's white paper as we seek to build a common foundation for market regulation.

[upbeat music plays] So I'm Gerard Brodie, I'm the CEO of Consumer Action Law Centre We represent low-income and vulnerable Victorians who are struggling with consumer issues including telecommunications issues
Look I think it varies significantly, there are some people that are more financially savvy maybe have looked around and found that the best offer whether that's often a prepaid offer so they can manage their budgets better
There are others in the community who are, sort of sold the high-end products
They seem good but the salesman can upsell them - the latest phone, the most expensive contract without really realising what they're signing up to you so we commonly speak to people who have entered into a contract that is expensive or in some way unfair and they're having problems with that and wanting some advice and assistance
I think affordability often stems from the way in which a particular product is sold sometimes people can receive calls from unsolicited sellers over the phone or even door-knocking, to sell them a particular phone plan or internet plan that seems good at the time but they don't really have the opportunity to think through whether it suits their requirements and a high pressure sale can mean that they sign up without that thinking through and that can become an affordability problem down the track when they realise that the bills are much more than they thought they would be to start off with
Look I think that our telcos and our internet providers could do a much better job in their selling practices
I'd like to see all these providers sort of abolish unsolicited sales and wait for a consumer to approach them and then be there to offer good independent advice about the best offer for someone
Now you see this online with big businesses, things like the Huffington Post or even BuzzFeed
These are almost large business type Super Connectors, that help businesses via their advertising platform, reach out and hit a lot of different people at once
But in real life, you can become a Super Connector, and that can be incredibly beneficial for you, because as a Super Connector, you're gonna find a lot of benefits
The first being, that you're never gonna be out of a job
Super Connectors always have the opportunity to find out about different job opportunities or different ways that they can jump into a new business, simply because, they're hearing about so many different business fields, but the real key to being a good Super Connector is the fact that whatever you want to promote is usually very easy to do because the people within your social network all owe you favors, as you've been helping connect them
So how do you do it
How do you become a networker
Well, it's pretty simple really
To start with, you need to make sure that you're going out and actually meeting as many people as possible
Marketing Guru Philip Kotler perhaps said it best.
Authentic marketing is not the active selling what you make.
But knowing what to make.
This would also be the first step in building a marketing model.
Hi, I'm Peggy Collins.
And we're going to talk a few minutes about how to build a marketing model.
The business world is littered with sad stories of people.

Today I'm going to talk to you about how to get a loan just by having bad credit.
There are very few ways to get a loan for businesses if you do have bad credit.
So the first point of advice is to clear up the credit that is bad.
I don't agree with the gender pay gap how the pay between men and women isn't equal.
Hi, I'm FBI Director Jim Comey.
Thanks for letting me speak with you today.
Fifty years ago today, the Jackson office opened its doors to the people of Mississippi.
It was the Freedom Summer of 1964—a watershed moment in the Civil Rights Movement.
As you know, the years before that Freedom Summer were marred by rampant Jim Crow violence.
By 1964, the struggle for civil rights in Mississippi—and across the nation—had reached a fever pitch.
The disappearance of three young Freedom Summer volunteers—James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner—ignited a nationwide outcry.
President Johnson and FBI Director Hoover agreed: The FBI was needed in Mississippi.
One hundred and fifty agents were dispatched to the state, the Mississippi Burning investigation began, and the Jackson office was born.
The job was not an easy one for those first employees, who faced threats and hostility from those trying to keep the status quo.
But by the end of August 1964, armed with new legal authorities under the Civil Rights Act—passed just days before the office opened—the Jackson Division had more than 100 civil rights cases.
By October, that number had skyrocketed to 859. Today we mark more than just a 50-year anniversary.
DELANA JONES: I don't know if the 2010 campaigns are going to be a good gauge for what we should expect out of the internet because it's a mid-term election.

WE HAVE A NEW PETITION THAT ANOTHER VIEWER HAS STARTED, BLESS HIS HEART.
IT IS TO GET A DEBATE ON THE YOUNG TURKS.
LUCKILY THE DNC ALREADY HAS A DEBATE SCHEDULED IN APRIL BUT I HAVE NOT ANNOUNCED YET WHO IT WILL BE WITH.
I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING, EXCEPT FOR WHAT I'M SAYING RIGHT NOW.
ONE OF YOU GUYS ALREADY STARTED A PETITION BEFORE I KNEW WHAT HAPPENED, I GOT NEWS OF IT TODAY, 37,000 PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY SIGNED.
IT IS AMAZING.
CAN I SEE 50,000? 100,000? THE DNC HAS ALREADY SCHEDULED APPROXIMATELY 1000 DEBATES AND TOWN HALLS ON ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA, OLD MEDIA, AND WHEN I SAY OLD MEDIA, IT IS QUITE LITERAL.
SO WHEN YOU GO ON CNN, THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE AUDIENCE THERE IS 64 YEARS OLD.
MSNBC, ALSO 64 YEARS OLD.
FOX NEWS IS 68 YEARS OLD.
HOW ABOUT THEY FINALLY TALK TO ONLINE MEDIA, LISTEN TO YOU GUYS?
IF WE DID IT TOGETHER, CERTAINLY IF WE DID IT WITH A PARTNER LIKE YOUTUBE, NOT ONLY WOULD IT HAVE A COLOSSAL AUDIENCE, IT WOULD BE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AUDIENCE.
DON'T THEY OWE YOUNGER AMERICANS THAT?
AND FOR EXAMPLE, OUR SHOW IS 75% UNDER THE AGE OF 35. THAT IS MASSIVELY AND COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN ALL THE CABLE NEWS STATIONS THAT HAVE AUDIENCES THAT ARE LITERALLY 30 YEARS OLDER.
AND IF DEMOCRATS ARE WONDERING HOW THEY REACH MILLENNIALS, IF YOU KEEP GOING ON TV AND REACHING 65-YEAR-OLD, YOU WILL NEVER REACH THE 35 AND UNDER.
We’ve talked about formal analysis, we used this.
We talked about content; we’ve used this image again.
Now we’re going to talk about context and this will be a brief lecture in which we only look at the context of this one powerful image.
This will fill in more, this will enhance our understand of it.
During the Great Depression in the mid 1930’s, leading up to the great stock market crash, artists found support through programs such as the Works Progress Administration, or WPA, which included varied activities of the Federal Art Project and the Resettlement Administration and the Farms Security Administration and so on.
They provided information to the public about government programs but also about the plight of the people the programs served.
So, if the government wished to sell a social program they found artists who could show the plight of the people in need of such support.
Dorothea Lang worked for the WPA in the Resettlement Administration.
She was hired to photograph the rural people displaced by the great depression and Migrant Mother Nipomo Valley shows just such a figure.
This is a starving migrant mother and her three children at a camp for migratory pea pickers in Nipomo California just down the state from us.
She was a displaced farmer who picked other people’s crops to feed her seven children, three of whom are showed here.
Just before this photograph was taken, and here we get into the context more deeply—we cannot know this from the photograph but it will speak volumes—the crop she was supposed to pick had frozen.
What that meant was that there was no work to be done; if there’s no work, there’s no food.
She had, just before this photograph was taken, sold the tires off of her car to buy food for her children.
Now yes or no questions helped the interviewer to establish clarity on details discussed
Leading questions help the client to admit to information that otherwise might be withheld
In this example, the client was reluctant to admit that her ex stole from her


Leading questions can also help a client to articulate ideas that they cannot express those ideas or do not see them as relevant
However, leading questions suggest an answer and have the potential to decrease the accuracy of the answer
Hi everyone! 2016 is almost finished and that seem so crazy to me because it feels like yesterday I was sitting down and talking about the things that I'd like to do in 2016
So now it's time to make that same video for 2017
So here goes, here are the things that I would like to do in 2017
I hope you enjoy
The first thing I would like to do in 2017 is stop moaning about petty things
Now this would be "stop moaning altogether", but I feel like moaning is therapeutic sometimes, it can really help solve a problem
But sometimes I find myself moaning about the most trivial things and I think it's just because I'm bored
And deep down I know that I'm very lucky and I'm very grateful for everything that I have so I should start verbalizing that and verbalizing how grateful I am for things instead of sounding unappreciative
In 2017, I'd also like to watch 25 movies that I've never seen before
Whenever I come to watch a movie, I tend to pick my favorites but maybe it's time for me to find some new favorites
There's so many movies out there that I've never seen before and maybe if I just watched them I'd find that I like them very much
So I'm setting myself the goal of finding 25 new movies for me to watch and let's see how that goes
My next goal for 2017 is something that sounds quite simple, but I think it's quite a challenge and I think it's something that everybody has to work on, on some level and that's "be nice to everybody"
Now that sounds quite simple when I'm in a good mood, but I want to be more conscious of how I make people feel when I'm in a bad mood because sometimes I snap, sometimes I'm grumpy, you know, everybody has those moments
And being grumpy can be infectious if you answer in the wrong way to somebody
And I don't wanna pass that on, I want the world to be happy
So that's just something I'd like to do
I don't want to be that person that makes somebody feel horrible
I'd also like to make 12 videos that help
12 videos is like one every month or so
Because I have various stories and experiences that might help somebody who's going through similar things at the moment So if those videos were to help even just one person then that would totally make this whole thing worth it
And the final thing I would like to do in 2017 is something that I'm always trying to do and that's "visit a place that I've never been to before"
And that could be like a foreign country or a city or it could even just be somewhere near my house that I've never visited before
The possibilities are endless, this is a big world and I feel like I want to experience as much of that as possible
So hopefully that should lead to some good adventures in 2017, who knows? So thanks very much for watching everybody, I hope you had a great 2016 and do let me know down below if you have any goals for 2017 and good luck achieving them! Thanks everyone and Happy New Year
The was one New Year's resolution that I had for 2016 that I definitely did not achieve and that was to stay in the country
You can check out my vlogs from San Francisco down here, that was the most epic way of breaking a New Year's resolution ever! So I hope you enjoy
Thanks everyone, cheerio! Subtitles by the Amara
The reason I chose a Loyola executive MBA program is because of convenience and quality.
The weekend format allows me to do my job in a leadership role for a local manufacturer who exports machinery all over the world.
But exposure to the program and how they use reflection has convinced me to be more structured about that.
That I, I bring it into work activity all the time; after an important meeting we’ll have a reflection: how did the meeting go?
After an important customer visit, we’ll have reflection: how’d the visit go?
And it is a powerful tool, something I learned here at Loyola.


You know, being true to one another, being physically intimate, they're all beautiful things
In this section we're going to discuss some methods you can use in dealing with tough customers.
A movie star is a working actor that's been elevated to the status of a move star by the public and the fans that watch movies.
Movie stars aren't typically made in their first time out of the gate so to speak but they are elevated to the status of a heavenly body as it were by the people that enjoy and appreciate movie, movies in general.

So why did you want to be a giver?
I wanted to be a giver because I wanted to reach light- and non-readers.
And what was your biggest joy, highlight,  or surprise of World Book Night?
The biggest joy for me was to, I went to Oak Park township senior center and Mills Tower and these are, there's another senior center.
Just, you know, seeing the joy after I have handed out the books.
Just seeing a big smile on their face.
And what information did you share about your book choice when giving books out?
My book was The Zoo Keeper's Wife: A War Story by Diane Ackerman.
Welcome to Crawford Park Financial.
I’m Joanna Crawford and Crawford Park Financial is a Hard Money Lender.
Today the topic is Business Purpose Loans.
Business purpose is one of the most relevant factors in an investment loan, it can exempt the loan from Section 32 and 35. If the loan is exempt, the Lender’s interest rate can be higher and the Lender and Broker can charge greater fees.
Sometimes in schools or with a writing assignment we move towards summative assessments where we just get this snapshot at the end of how students are doing.
This is financial adviser Patrick Munro talking about can IRA contributions to Roth's be withdrawn without penalty.

So often you get sent out to do a story by yourself.
That means you have to report it, edit it, shoot it, all by yourself.
They call it backpack journalism.
So when you get to an interviewee and you tell them hey, I'm sorry, I'm only one man today.
Can you help me out?
You either hand them the mic or you do it yourself.
Hey everybody, Aaron back again.
Today I want to talk a little about commodities and how you can successfully trade them on the binary option market.
If you have only traded stocks, Indices or currencies so far you should really take the time to learn a little more before you dive into this field as commodities behave a little differently, which can have a serious impact on your trade results.
Stocks are impacted mostly by how the company they represent does, cash flow, profit etc.
Currencies revolve around the strength (real or perceived) of the country's finances and indices are also influenced by politics on top of all of those issues.
This is Patrick Munro talking about what is the Standard and Poor five hundred.
Every beginning investor should know that the Standard and Poor five hundred is the oldest index that's been out there in the United States since the stock market began.
Standard and Poor five hundred is comprised of every industry sector in America and most of the companies that are in the S and P five hundred as it's known, are blue chip companies.
You may have heard that term blue chip.
Elizabeth Griffin&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Elizabeth Griffin.
I'm a marine wildlife scientist and fisheries campaign manager at Oceana.
I'm here in Doha at the CITES meeting.
It was a really exhilarating and really exhausting day today.
We started off the day with launching a new paper written by the Oceana scientists in Madrid, and the paper documented the fact that 10 million kilograms a year of shark fins are entering the Hong Kong market.
This is equivalent to the weight of over 2,000 African elephants.
It's just an enormous amount of shark fins.
We got a lot of media attention on the paper, including Reuters and AP, and then I was interviewed in a life Al Jazeera interview too.

Ok, I am Tracy Goodwin, and I am the red sweater lady, and I am here to talk to you about humorous interpretation, and you're saying to yourself, what is humorous interpretation?
Well, you might be in a college speech course, or you might be in a toastmasters group, or you might be in high school speech, or you might be looking to do competitive speech, and humorous interpretation is one of the events that you can choose to participate in.
People need to agree on what counts as a valid way of answering a question as well
Someone might feel that the answer was revealed to him in a dream
Someone else might have claimed to have found an answer in an ancient prophecy
But when dealing with scientific questions, it’s important that we’re relying on the rigorous standards of scientific inquiry
Consilience of Evidence and Social Calibration are important but still might not be enough
To be really confident that consensus is correct, it also helps to see agreement coming from many different groups from many different backgrounds
In other words, we want to see Social Diversity
To understand why, it helps to look at cases in which a lack of Social Diversity can lead to the wrong conclusions
One is plain old bad luck
It is always possible to reach a conclusion of “yes” when the answer correctly is really “no” or vice versa
It could be a statistical fluke
The great gold rush is on and a lot of Americans are getting involved in gold because of the fact that its value is shooting up significantly.
Well, the Klondike, back in the 1897 Gold Rush, was a very important component of mining gold, right out of the stream with a sluice pan and things of that nature, gold miners were staking their fortune back then.
Nowadays mining is much more sophisticated.
Large mining companies basically strip mine large deposits and where deposits are located.
Strip mining involves using specialized equipment, large earth movers that scrape off various layers of the substrata, and then put it on conveyor belts where it is separated from it's substrata looking for the actual ingots or actual raw ore that comes out.
It can often be very difficult to differentiate between regular or sort of normal irregular heart beats and one that can be more problematic or dangerous.
Often symptoms that do not go away quickly by themselves or irregular heart rhythms that are associated with chest discomfort, lightheadedness, dizziness, shortness of breath do require and should require additional evaluation.
When a patient presents with an irregular heart rhythm, the first step is actually to get a complete story of the patient and understand what the symptoms are.

I think the broader trend is search, social, and mobility.
Hello, my name is F.J.
Jay’s ultimate lesson to me came this past week.
When the press release announcing Jay’s death was posted Wednesday night I paused after I read  the link from the KU home page to that news release.
That link read this; it said,  “University Mourns Long-time Employee Jay Turnbull.”  Think about that for a moment.
That headline could just as easily have read,  “University Mourns Son of Distinguished Professors,” or “University Mourns Special Worker.”  Instead the headline points out a simple fact.
That Jay was a person in and of himself,  independent of who his parents were   or whether he had a disability, or did not have a disability.
He was a person who worked for 20 years  and who contributed greatly to the mission of the Beach Center,  the Lifespan Institute, the School of Education, and the University of Kansas.
And in reflecting on that headline and thinking about Jay  and his impact on my life and the lives of others,  I realized that the most important lesson Jay taught me  was not really about the possible lives  that people with severe disabilities tend to lead.
Let’s talk about fighting.
This is a story about two rival groups, the Yooks and the Zooks, who eat bread with the butter on different sides of the bread.
An elderly Yook explains to his grandson that he has been watching the Zooks for a long time and has met a rival named VanItch.
Soon, it becomes an arms race between the grandfather and VanItch, as each one gets better weapons than their adversary.
Finally, the Yooks create a bomb and send everyone underground.
In the end, the grandfather holds the bomb and is surprised to see that VanItch also has a similar bomb.
As always, a lot can be said about this story, but what draws my interest and attention is the idea of fighting and how one goes about winning a fight.
And this isn’t about arguing and disagreeing, but it’s when the arguing boils over into the physical.
The idea of fighting is interesting because it seems like once you move from the realm of the verbal and enter the realm of the physical, things have the potential to never end.
Unless, of course, you annihilate the entire enemy, and even then, there will always be potential for a new enemy to step in and thus more fighting to ensue.
This story demonstrates how ridiculous and petty fighting, or war, can be and ultimately, the story ends at a standstill with both soldiers holding bombs that will not only destroy each other, but both cities and civilizations.
And that’s not to say that war or fighting is not necessary.
Unfortunately, some injustices can only be settled with the physical.
But it’s when these grander scales between nations are shrunken down to the schoolyard, that’s where things can become socially jumbled.
The dividend yield ratio measures the percentage of a stock’s market value returned annually to the stockholders in the form of a dividend.
Preferred stockholders pay special attention to this ratio because they invest primarily to receive dividends.

Hello, my name is Oyun-Erdene I'm pleased to introduce the "I know Mongolia" project
The mission of this project is to promote Mongolia properly by building up trusted resource about Mongolia in an effort to promote the brand, voice and identity of Mongolia
I started this project on October 2014 Through I know Mongolia Project, we can contribute to Mongolia in four ways
First, building up database covering all about Mongolia will make it convenient for those who need reliable information about Mongolia and/or do research
Secondly, with this convenience available, it'll attract tourists and raise the number of people who interest Mongolia Thirdly, using the data we collected, we can educate young Mongolians so that they would raise up knowing their own identity, history, tradition and their importance
Fourth, but not least, those who are part of IKM will not only educate themselves but also their peer and will gain invaluable experience
To fulfill all this possibilities as fast and efficient as we can, IKM Project needs passionate and talented folks who are ready and willing to contribute their own share to Mongolia
If you want to contribute through IKM Project, I welcome you to apply for Organizing Committee position! Application is open on December 1st and will close on March 31st The link to detailed info about application is in the comment section below
Developing Northern Australia conference Minister Canavan address Thank you for inviting me to speak at the third Developing Northern Australia conference
I’m sorry I couldn’t join you today, as it is a sitting week in Canberra
But I want to thank you as well for all the work that many of you have done, over a number of years, to deliver the very first White Paper for Developing Northern Australia at the Commonwealth Government level, and the record investments we are making in Northern Australia
I am only standing on the shoulders of those who came before me as the Minister for Northern Australia
People like Ian Macdonald, who’s played a great role down here, but people also like Allan Dale, who’s been involved for so many years on the Developing Northern Australia agenda
And I want to thank Allan and his team for once again putting together a very important conference with a great array of speakers to talk about what we do next for developing the North
Over the past year, we have been very focused on delivering for Northern Australia
We have announced 700 million dollars of road funding, for beef roads, for the Northern Australian roads program
And we’ve also announced that we’re going to seal the Outback Way, the first time a government has made a commitment to deliver only the third sealed road between our East-West connections across Australia
We’ve also established the five billion dollar Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, and it has a strong pipeline of projects
Over sixty projects are under consideration for it as well
We continue to make advancements on the water agenda
As you would know at this conference, more than 60 per cent of Australia’s rainfall falls in Northern Australia, and we have a number of studies out looking at what we do next to better harness those resources, including CSIRO studies we announced a couple of years ago that are due back within the next year
That will be exciting
‘Cause now that we are hard delivering on a lot of this agenda, we do need to think about the next steps we take to continue to build on the momentum we have here at the Federal Government level that will rely, and continue to require, people like yourself to be that loud voice up there in the North, so down here in Canberra we hear how important developing the North is – not just to you, not just to the people who live in Northern Australia, but also to the advancement of our country as a whole
Because developing Northern Australia is not about just helping Australians who live in Northern Australia, it is also about making sure that we deliver the best result for our country, that we do develop all of our resources around this great country that we have, and Northern Australia already has played a big role in our history and has even perhaps a greater contribution to make to our future
Hello creators.
My name is Andrew Mercer and I have been using Audacity for many years now myself and with my students.
We find it to be a great piece of software for recording and editing sound.
Sometimes we have problems with Audacity and waste a lot of time trying to find solutions.
That is why I created the Video Guide to Audacity.
The Video Guide to Audacity is a collection of video tutorials activities and projects that will take you from the very beginning of how do use Audacity to advanced editing techniques.
This is financial adviser, Patrick Munro, talking about the benefits of investing in certificates of deposit.
As a young person, you may want to start your financial journey by investing in certificates of deposit and building up a reference, if you will, with the bank.
Certificate of deposit is a first line asset, that anyone can have with a bank.
If you place a certificate of deposit with a bank, you can borrow against that, as well, to build your credit, going forward in life.
I'm pointing to the stadium, by the way, is I would start a program that would send a jersey to every six year old boy and girl in the New York, New Jersey tri-state area with a handwritten note from me saying thank you
Or maybe just a note that I would sign some, because that's a big number but I wanna basically convert every single youth into the green, not the blue, and so that would be the number one thing I would do, start the program that I've been imagining and dreaming about my whole life

What exactly IS a Health Insurance Exchange?
An Exchange is, to put it simply, like a typical online store, but instead of it being a place to buy clothing or gifts or music, it's one where you buy Individual and Family Health Insurance plans.
Specifically, plans which meet the coverage requirements under The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.
There are two basic types of Exchanges.
One is a Public Exchange, built and run by either the state government in which it operates, or it is built and run by the federal government on behalf of the state in which it operates.
The other kind of is a Private Exchange, which is the same concept, a website in which you can buy an Obamacare-qualified health plan, but it is built and run by a private company.
What we need is not to change democracy and find another form of government.
There is no escape from the party system, that the parties compete among themselves as to who will represent the principle of "social justice" and the other principles, and people will then choose democratically between them.
The question here is that we need to change direction in terms of everything connected to the conception of economics and society.
There were two sacred cows in Israel.
The first is the defense budget and the second is privatization and the market economy.
These are two disasters that harmed the weakest classes and harmed equality.
So there is no need to change democracy, but we need to slaughter these sacred cows and to establish a new sacred cow of justice and equality.
Karen Kolski, the assistant regional superintendent in the northeast region the school district of Philadelphia.
So tonight is around leadership, and we all know that leadership is associated with great schools.
And so it takes a great leader to really ensure that all students achieve at high levels.
So tonight, I'm talking about what it takes for that leadership to be chosen for a school for a district that we know it's about great staff, great accountability, and certainly around who does that leader ensure collaboratively with the parents, community, staff, that all students achieve at high levels.
So my work tonight is around really highlighting some leadership development initiatives that we've been doing in the school district of Philadelphia, and really talking about those stories, those compelling stories, around first, second, and third year principles who really made a difference in our district.

In a report released by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India Private Limited titled, ‘Indian Higher Education Sector: Opportunities aplenty, growth unlimited!' success in leveraging knowledge and innovation that could contribute to hi-tech manufacturing and high value-added services is only possible with a sound infrastructure of higher education is highlighted.
The report highlights the attractiveness of the "higher education sector and the excellent opportunities it provides for Indian private and foreign investment even within the existing framework.
Now the next thing that we need to do, no matter how hard it is, I've been talking about how email is for quick responses, it's about quickness it's about fast communication, well you're going to have to slow down just a minute.
It is essential that before you hit that send button that you edit your email.
Oh hi my name is Talia and I don't usually do these kind of videos but the thing is that over a year ago I made a video explaining why the application Talking Angela wasn't really dangerous and I still get a lot of comments saying the same things over and over again so that's why I am making this video.
Before starting I have to say that I am going to be leaving a bunch of articles in the description box below so if you don't believe anything I say, you can go and check that out.
Ok I get a lot of comments related to her eyes.
I have to say that she doesn't have reflections in her eyes anymore If you wanna know what the reflections in her eyes were, just check out my other video that I will be leaving down below All I am going to say is that those reflections were added to make her eye look more realistic we all have reflections in our eyes too.
The hacker knows that you are recording and that's why he doesn't tell you that he is there.
Ok, that makes sense but the thing is that according to the rumors the hacker makes very obvious that he is there.
You just have to read the things that people say about the application.
There are people who even say that he goes around showing himself in Angela's eyes, so he totally makes it obvious that he is there.
you are not a child and the hacker is obviously not interested in you.
ok yeah, but the thing is that my brother and many other young people have played with the application, and nothing bad has ever happened.
And if the application was really dangerous, the thing is that it wouldn't exist anymore.
Many people who have used this application have been raped and killed All those things are fake and I have to tell you the same thing I just said.

Part 1: Where are we going for dinner

You’re all hungry and want to go to a restaurant, but you don’t know which one to pick
You’re all very different and have different ideas on what you want to eat

Hi this is Jessica Smith and this is how much money to budget for gas.
Hi, Expo TV.
My name is Nastasia and I would like to tell you about Gillette Venus Spa Breeze shaving cartridge refills.
Now these come in sets of four.
And they come in a handy little package, like this, to keep everything from drying out.
And what they look like is this.
Now what makes these so great is this stuff right here, and right here.
What this is is basically a solid lotion/shave gel that makes it so that this is all you need to shave whatever you need to shave.
It's very, very moisturizing.
It doesn't dry your skin out at all, like some shaving creams can.

We're discussing signaling techniques for emergency situations.
SCOTT DUPONT: Scott duPont here.
Welcome back to Film Producing 101 on behalf of Expert Village.
So one of the first or second or third steps, definitely high in the priorities when you first get started, you want to build a team of advisers if you will.
And we have some questions for them and then afterwards, we'll open it up for the audience to ask questions



Well, that you all for coming out today
My name is Robin Doseng I'm the International student from Vancouver, British Columbia
Alicia: We like to throw in prep courses for ICD-10. This time since Laureen was away, I kind of shuffled these information slides in between some of our content slides, and wanted to bring up the ICD-10 Mini Course, the ICD-10 Full Course which has a payment plan.
We all see what's happening.

If you’re in the GCC and looking for a job in Canada, there’s going to be a Canadian job fair in Dubai on May 24th and in Abu Dhabi on May 26th
These are going to be actual Canadian employers, coming to the region, looking for employees with specific job experience, who are interested in immigrating to Canada for these jobs
The job fair is actually sponsored by the Canadian Government and specifically, the Government of New Brunswick, which is one of the provinces in Canada, on the East Coast
They are looking for families and for people who are interested in immigrating to New Brunswick
The specific job experience that they’re looking for is: food service supervisors and managers, home support workers, process control operators and food and beverage processing
Labourers in food and beverage and tobacco processing and tailors, seamstress’s, sewing machine operators for made-to-measure garments
So, it’s specifically this work experience that they’re looking for
The eligibility requirements that you need: You’ll need to do your IELTS, your English language test and get a level of five on each band
You’ll also need to get any education that you have accredited by an organisation that’s recognised by the Canadian Government
You’ll also need proof of work experience, so a letter of employment from your previous employer and also have sufficient savings
So, for an individual this is approximately 3 000 Dollars Canadian that you need to show that you have in your bank account
So, if you have these eligibility requirements and you have work experience in one of the jobs that I’ve mentioned, then you should register
You’ll see in our Facebook posts, there is a link to the website that you can go to register for this event
The event is actually an employer driven event, which means they’re going to have an information session but then they’re actually going to be conducting interviews after so make sure you come prepared with all of your documents, your CV and your other supporting documents with you
And be ready to also do an interview
They’re going to be creating an inventory of employees for this event which then they will use for events going forward
So, even if you do not get an invite or get a job through this event, you will then be on the register and may get invited to a later event, later in 2017 or in 2018, so it’s very important to register
If you haven’t got your education accredited or haven’t got your IELTS exam completed yet, start the process now and bring that documentation with you to the event so that you can show the people when you arrive that you have started the process
So as I mentioned, there is a link, on this Facebook post, that you can go to, to register

They then will give you the information on where this event will be located and the time that you should come
And it’s called… the link is “livinginNB, so New Brunswick, livinginNB
ca”, and also, if you have any questions that you’d like to email the people who are organising this, then you can go to: promotions@gnb

Everywhere I go, across America and around the world, I hear from people, especially young people, who are ready to start something of their own — to lift up people’s lives and shape their own destinies.
That’s entrepreneurship — that spark of prosperity that creates new jobs and new businesses, new ways to deliver basic services, new ways of seeing the world.
That’s why since 2010, the Global Entrepreneurship Summit has brought together the best innovators, thinkers, social entrepreneurs and investors to a different region of the world, from the United States to sub-Saharan Africa.
And I’ve seen firsthand what a difference it can make for entrepreneurs — especially for women and people from marginalized communities — to connect with each other, to get feedback on their ideas, and build the networks that can help turn their dream for a business or program or app into reality.
This week, innovators around the world are marking Global Entrepreneurship Week.
I’m calling on the private sector, foundations, investors and universities to help us increase opportunities for all entrepreneurs, no matter who they are, where they’re from, or what they look like.
And I’m pleased to announce that next year, the United States will once again host the Global Entrepreneurship Summit — this time in the birthplace of modern innovation: Silicon Valley.
MARY ANN BELLIVEAU: The thing that marketers are really focused on now is really staying abreast of this innovation and understanding the implications for their brands.
So whether that takes the form of making sure their sites are ready for a mobile query on a hand-held, which we know is happening more and more often.
Or having assets that are discoverable in a video format that patients are truly interested in engaging with.
Marketers are really thinking about not just what's happening today, but what's happening next with innovation in technology.
And how to make sure that the information that is important for them to convey to their patients and their doctors is in a format that will be suitable for the advances that we're seeing in technology.
Maybe zoos are a good thing for animals.
This is a story about a young man named Piscine Patel, or Pi, whose family owns a zoo in India.
Growing up, Pi is interested in religion and so he converts to each of the major religions: Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism.
The family decides to move to Canada, but on the way there, their ship sinks and Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with a tiger, Richard Parker, a hyena, a zebra, and an orangutan.
Pi manages to keep himself separated from the other animals and can only watch as the hyena kills the zebra and orangutan.
Pi fears that he will be killed next, but the tiger kills the hyena.
Pi decides to build an adjoining raft that is connected to the lifeboat by rope and luckily finds survival supplies, such as food and water.
Instead of waiting for the tiger to die, Pi decides he must train the tiger to ensure his own personal survival.
Pi learns to fish and begins feeding the tiger, slowly training and taming him.
As food and water supplies dwindle, Pi struggles with health issues, like sores and dehydration.
He also becomes temporarily blind.
Pi encounters another blind man who is also floating on a boat.
However, the man comes aboard and the tiger eats him.
When Pi’s eyesight returns, he sees an island in the distance.
He arrives on the island and finds algae that he can eat.
and take time to all be together
Because having physical contact, looking at people in the eye, and actually having fun together and not having it all be business, is really important
And we also make sure that we meet up every single quarter at a destination to have a quarterly meeting
And this makes it so that we can all be on check, we have an agenda that we go over, we're very conscious of our time together
But again, we make sure that we have down time to have some fun
And that is really important when you are running a virtual team
You've probably received at least one request from a stranger on LinkedIn.
Simply reply to them - politely -  by saying "Can you just refresh my memory as to how we know each other"? It's a nice way to get the conversation started.
-Of course, knowing where Trump likes to grab people, that might have been part of the problem
[ Applause ] I personally can't wait for those hearings
Congressman, show us where on the doll the president tried to make the deal
Healthcare was the first test of Trump's supposed deal making skills, and it went up in flames
So what is Trump's team saying now about his inability to get a deal done
-I think the one thing we learned this week is that Washington is a lot more broken than President Trump thought that it was
-That's right, Washington is just a lot more broken that Donald Trump thought
And to be fair, he didn't really know the system
-Nobody knows the system better than me
I have to say here at Ollie &amp; Darsh, the customer care is absolutely brilliant.
With everything in life now, I think it’s even more about the experience.
We want an experience, whether that’s going shopping or going eating or on vacations or holidays to coming to Ollie &amp; Darsh.
We want the whole experience and it has to be great and it is.
Dream, I used to work in one of these buildings, it’s not as good as it seems
You’re not just a sinner saved by grace, but a beloved son or daughter eternally embraced
You’re already just as loved now as you ever will be, Christ paid it all and now you are free
Free to live both for the now and not yet, the kingdom to come and its present silhouette
See Hope must be our anthem cause one day we will witness, Christ coming down to bring the kingdom in its fullness
Until then we have Christ in us, the hope of glory, so let’s run the race and get caught up in a bigger story
Cause this world is broken but beautiful, and God uses us to help restore it before our funerals
So let’s not sit around and wait for the pearly gates, let’s do something now before it’s too late
No matter what you’ve done you’re forgiven, and your story is still being written
Heaven could be happening all around, on this street, in this town
Being a conservative and being a Republican align but not fully
Being a conservative is what i consider myself first
I support the rights to freedom on all levels
That means I get the right to choose however I want to live my life and I'm not going to govern and legislate to make sure i'm coming into your life to tell you how to live
The Republican platform is the one that aligns closely with what I believe and that's why i'm a Republican
I think a big part of being a republican is wanting a smaller government role
I think, especially in like a globalized society with all these huge issues, I really think government needs to be well equipped to deal with all the problems that can arise
What it means to be a Democrat as I understand a lot of the party is focused on diversity but often I see diversity of skin color and not so much diversity of thought which is most concerning to me because at the end of the day we should be judged by what's in our mind and the contents of our character rather than the color of our skin
Being a Democrat means fighting for equality
Being a Democrat means you stand up for people whose voices might not be heard as loudly as others
FELICE FRANKEL: Hey, everyone
This is our first video update
We are now starting week one of the course
I think that what we'll probably say now more than anything else is a quick conversation about the equipment
Many of you are concerned that I'm being a little too picky in what I'm requiring of you
Now, first of all, I am not requiring anything of you
What I'm doing is showing you what I do and my technique
My hope is that you'll like what I make-- the images that I make-- and follow my lead
And for the most part the exercises that we've developed really are intended to be used with a 105 macro lens on a camera that can take lenses
It is not going to work for you if you are going to just use a snap and shoot, or whatever you call it these days
You really want to meet the standards, if I could say that, that we are suggesting you pay attention to
It is true that you can, on occasion, use extension tubes instead of-- for example, let's say you don't have as much of a macro lens as you'd like
And so you can use tube extensions as long as they don't have any glass
But you'll be losing f-stops in the process, and you'll find out more about aperture and f-stops in the oncoming weeks
So those of you who are technically savvy, I hope that you'll find what our exercises have become developed into
And the ideas in the course will be appropriate for your needs as well
But just getting back to the equipment, for example, when we get up to using a camera and a lens, which is in a week two, you're going to see that I'm going to suggest using software
And you'll probably say, why is she doing that? Well I'd like to hope that I'm going to be making a case for that
So in the end, please consider following what we're suggesting
It works for me
And my hope is that what works for me is going to work for you
But this coming week, we're going to have more fun in the sense that you're not aware that hard, because you're going to be using a flatbed scanner and you're going to be a bit shocked at some of the wonderful images you can get from that
So in any event, we hope we're going to create something wonderful for you

Part of what I do at WKAR-TV is to oversee programming for the station.
hiring manager remember who you are
My journalism instructor at my school taught me how to answer this
If I were to be asked this question, I would say that I am someone who is mostly on time, so no matter the burden, I will get to work on time
Even if it means waking up early and getting on that bus to get to work
I could also say that throughout school I had a perfect attendance, so the days that I am scheduled, I will be here
Employers want potential employees who are going to be responsible, so saying something that shows your responsibility, will really make an impression on the employer
And that is it

Today is a big day at NASA.
Later I'll be joining members of Congress to make a major announcement on our next heavy-lift launch system but I wanted you, members of the NASA family to hear it first from me.
The next chapter of America’s space exploration story is being written, right here, right now.
We’ve selected the design for a new space exploration system that will take humans far beyond Earth.
This important decision will create high-quality jobs here at home, and provide the cornerstone for America’s future human space exploration efforts.
This new heavy-lift rocket will be America’s most powerful since the Saturn V rocket that carried Apollo astronauts to the moon.
It will launch humans to places no one has gone before, such as asteroids, Mars and other deep space destinations.
In combination with the crew capsule already under development, commercialization of astronaut travel to low-Earth Orbit, extension of activities on the International Space Station, and a fresh focus on new technologies, this rocket is key to implementing the plan laid out by President Obama and Congress.
President Obama challenged us to be bold and dream big, and that's exactly what we are doing at NASA.
While I was proud to fly on the space shuttle, tomorrow's explorers will now dream of one day walking on Mars.
This launch vehicle decision is the culmination of a months-long, comprehensive review of potential designs to ensure that the nation gets the best possible rocket for the investment, one that is not only powerful, but is also evolvable so it can be adapted to different missions as opportunities arise and new technologies are developed.
The rocket will use a liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen fuel system.
RS-25D/E engines will provide the core propulsion and the J2X engine is planned for use in the upper stage.
There will be a full and open competition to develop the boosters based on performance requirements.
Its early flights will be capable of lifting 70-100 metric tons before evolving to a lift capacity of 130 metric tons.
BRUCE FALCK: The big meta trends in display media are audience-based buying.
That's the ability to buy an individual rather than a proxy for an individual.
that it knows what your emotion is, that it has this model inside that is computing your emotion
But instead, it's an interaction where emotion is constructed and interpreted and given meaning as in a dialogue between the user and the system, or between users through a system
After a while, instead of working in opposition against Affective Computing, I think we just discovered there's so many interesting applications that we can build and we can use some of the same technologies and some of the same insights perhaps on what emotion is, but build other kinds of systems
If you’re like many people, speaking is mostly a matter of words, something you do with your face.
But when you think about it, it’s little wonder communication skills become less effective under those circumstances.
Speech loses its personal connection and your message loses its impact.
What can be done to ensure your listeners see the real you and feel the true power of your words?
Here’s a three-step method to get the process started.
Relax from the inside-out.
Muscle tension anywhere in your body affects your voice and distorts your message, and just because you don’t notice muscle tension doesn’t mean it isn’t there.
If your impulse to speak must fight its way through six layers of tension to see the light of day, what comes out bears little resemblance to your original intention.
A relaxation program to help you identify and release deep muscle tension will make you a better speaker.
We're talking about presentation still, and now I want to talk about vocal expression.
Did the speaker, did the presenter use enough vocal expression?
sometimes we have to go to [inaudible] in Avon
Sometimes we have to, we have the Christmas party at the train depot in Plainfield and stuff
And sometimes we go to different churches to have volunteer and stuff
Kelsey: Start doing it as you go and progressing and progressing and progressing
Learn stuff that you don't even know about through like someone like Kyle, someone's been in the role before
Like me, I've never been in a co-president or president role before

&gt;&gt; Role models are an integral part of the social fabric of any community and predominantly in an area or in a region where the youth form a high proportion of the population.
There are two roles or two important aspects that role models should play.
One is to ensure that the values and ethical behaviors of a generation are passed down to a new generation.
I work in an office and I do a lot of paperwork and administrative work and...I mean it probably doesn't sound that fascinating but I'm confident that it's going to turn into something better.
Right now I'm working away in a cubicle every day.
And that whole cubicle environment seems kind of silly.
It's almost like a zoo for people.
By going to the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions you get such a breadth of science that you really can build and tap into that really expansive knowledge.



Hey everyone, it’s Tyrone from Tyroneshum.com.
Thanks very much for visiting this video today.
I want to share with you something that a lot of people particularly my coaching students and subscribers have been asking me is how do I manage all my virtual staff and all the team together, not having to spend so much time checking back and forth and managing the projects.
Well, what I would suggest highly is to create or to buy a system such as project management system to put into place.
One that I’ve been using very successfully is called ActiveCollab.
ActiveCollab is not that expensive to buy, you can actually buy it outright for around $400 US.
Once you set that system up, you can basically be able to access and transfer all the details and manage your day-to-day projects all in one place.
We use our audience, if you like, to help build our brand, in the sense that we are all about helping people engage, understand, and participate, in current events.
So there should be no surprise as to what’s going on in the world and why it’s happening.
We also make it very easy for people then to, as Arianna was mentioning this morning, to empathize.
So that they can go and volunteer, they can go and contribute.
Again, there’s a variety of different tools.
Good afternoon health psychology students!

Hello everyone.

Are you subject to road rage
Do you easily get upset when things don't go your way
Does your mood rise and fall with the stock market
Do you get angry when you hear political opinions that disagree with yours
Do you get upset when others don't act the way you think they should act
Does your mood rise and fall with the weather
If so, then you've probably been trying to control what you can't control
This is Nikolai Pankraz with American Resource Network for Expert Village.
What Susan and Greg said is true.
It's very important that we try to step outside of an event to examine the positive experiences we can get from it.
Having dealt with it myself, as I'm sure many of you have, I understand how difficult it can be, to see the positive side of a traumatic event, like losing a loved one.

Just want to tell you a little bit about the new newsletter that we're producing
Every time we produce the newsletter there's going to be a feature article, video tips, job interview tips, general career advice, information about redundancy and outplacement support that we provide as well

Okay, we're at the end.
See, wasn't that easy?
I'm Michael Campbell with Doggie Styles in Beverly Hills, California and I'm here to talk about how to design a retail store.
I think the most important thing is to first come up with a concept.
What type of store do you want?
What image do you want?
Do you want it to be upscale?
Do you want it to be more country?
Do you want it to be comfortable?
Hi, my name is Jessica Claire and I'm a professional dating coach here in New York City for New York Dating Coach.
In this clip, we're going to talk about how to meet a woman at the gym.
This is a very difficult thing to do and the reason is because she's there for a specific purpose that has nothing to do with you, so be careful about the people that you choose hit on at the gym.
She has her earphones in and she's running on the treadmill, and it's not the best time to talk to her.
In fact, just when she's get off the treadmill and she's trying to like settle down after a long run, also not the best time.
Our goal is to make sure consumers have control over their own information on the internet or offline.
And so our goal is to protect consumers' reasonable expectation of privacy, we want to make sure that if a consumer gives information to a company to use for one purpose, it isn't sold and used by a second company for a different purpose.
Then that makes the most sense, especially since Hit's now been re-energized after hundreds of years of, Dormancy and weariness

I can't wait for this
This is going to be a titanic battle
As to who made the order, well, we don't really know
And honestly, I'm not gonna make any speculations right now
Because, I want to wait until this episode come out
And make my own conclusions from there
Now as we look on these lists here for the other episodes, it looks like we got 2 cool-down episodes After episode 68

This is financial advisor, Patrick Munro, talking about what is a variable annuity.
A variable annuity, just like the word implies, variable is Wall Street's version of what an annuity should be.
What they've done is they've taken mutual funds, which are of course variable in nature, and they've wrapped it in a sheath of life insurance; therefore, making the benchmark of an annuity.
The problem is that mutual funds are of have the following rules attached to them.
...people with disabilities, because golf is the ultimate rehabilitation tool.
If we can get people with disabilities to try the game, and convince them that they can do something that they think they couldn't do before, that establishes the mindset that, "If I can do this, what else can I do that I couldn't do before?" That's the first step to getting them back into the mainstream of society and off of public assistance.
I think that this whole initiative benefits the game of golf because we want the sport to look like a snapshot of America, and you can't have a snapshot of America without the disabled population being involved.
Our underlying tenet has always been to work with all people, and bring them into the game of golf and more importantly, keep them into the game of golf.
This is one population - people with disabilities - that has not been tapped in the industry, and with our over-reaching goal in the industry, Golf 2020, to reach and to grow the game of golf.
This is a group of 54, approximately 54 million people that we, as a group, are focusing on.
This is a tremendous initiative for growing the game of golf and in growing the game of golf with inclusion for all.
...because we, as a golf industry, just like any other recreation industry struggle with keeping our industry vital, and increasing the numbers of people who participate in our sport, and really, there are a lot of golfers in America who are considered to be disabled who want to play the game of golf.
We know that there are many who are already playing the game, but there are many who, for different reasons, have not taken up the game.
Either it's because they are not aware that there are special assistive devices that help them play the game, or they're intimidated much like a beginning golfer might be of going to the golf course.
If you've never played a round of golf before, the golf course can be a very intimidating environment until you really figure out how things work.
Gary Hennerberg here, author of Crack the Customer Mind Code, Seven Pathways from Head to Heart to YES!
Let’s get right to the fourth of seven pathways that align marketing messaging with how the mind processes information and makes decisions.
So far we’ve learned about the need to identify the persona of our buyer, why we should stimulate emotion and the need to calm the mind.
Our next initiative in marketing messaging should be to position, or reposition, your product or organization, and create a compellingly unique selling proposition.
A unique selling proposition, or U-S-P, succinctly positions or repositions how you want to portray your story, your product, and even your organization.
It creates a strong, new memory about you.
That’s key, because when effectively communicated, it’s turned into a long-term memory in the hip uh campus.
New long-term memory is essential because it leads to the highest comprehension and your ability to convert a prospect into a customer.
And a strong USP is an easy way to make this new, long-term memory.
If you’re like many organizations, you might not have a branding statement.
In my book, I give you steps to create your own branding statement.
A branding statement is a marketing tool.
Hi, I'm Seth - The Guitar Guy!
You can find me at www.theguitarguy.org.
So you have been invited to a five-star restaurant, going to make it sound really fancy, let's take a look at some tips to know what to do.
Hi, I'm Hazely Lopez from Hazely Academy of Refinement and Modeling and I'm here to talk to you about how to behave in a five-star restaurant.
Well, you first may want to take a look at the menu before you actually get to the table.
Have you ever been disappointed with a promotional product you've purchased, such as an imprinted T-shirt, pen, or bag?
Me too, and you know what?
I'm in the business.
Hi, I'm Heidi Thorne of Thorne Communications, and I'm a promotional products marketer.
In well over two decades of being in sales, advertising, and marketing, I've seen a lot of people make a lot of mistakes when they buy promotional products.
But what I also found is that there aren't a lot of resources out there to teach people how to buy this stuff.
So that's why I wrote "Swag: How to Choose and Use Promotional Products for Marketing Your Business." In the book, we start out by discussing the promo with purpose concept, which looks at your marketing objectives, your values, and your image, so that you can select the right product for your business.



[loop] Right, so there we go
Now, you also have a pitch envelope, and I wanted to talk about the pitch envelope specifically for kick drums
Today some hard lessons all candidates should hear, courtesy of the American Presidential campaign.
If you debase the conversation, you debase yourself.
If you spew hate, you will be hated.
If you advocate violence, violence will visit you.
so this is something I teach my students during their first year and it's always met with complete disbelief, despite it being based on official data.
Many people believe this about Spain and Spanish workers.
Many Spanish workers sleep siestas at home or at work.
Spanish workers work less hours than in other European countries.
Spanish salaries are amongst the highest in the European Union.
True or false?
-Well, the key to avoid being convicted for DUI is really to gather all of the evidence together, to collect all of the evidence.
We want to know the maintenance and calibration history of the machine that was used.
We want to know the training and experience of the police officer.
We want to know to what extent he followed the regulations he's supposed to and to what extent he violated the regulations that he's supposed to.

So, I want to start by talking about the student debt crisis.
Today, there are over 40 million Americans who have about 1.2 trillion dollars in student debt, what do you think is the best way to help borrowers who are struggling the most with paying off their loans?
Okay, for openers, the United States Congress should refinance student loan debt.
To just bring down, at a minimum, bring down the interest payments on those loans.
You know, this is what's really appalling is it's set up right now so that the United States government makes a profit off the backs of people who have to borrow money to go to school.
And I'll just give you one example of that.
After you account for the bad debt losses and the cost of the funds and the administrative cost — just one section of loans, the section that went out between 2007 and 2012, we just happen to have good numbers on these — are now on target to produce $66 billion in profits for the United States government.
If the government would let students refinance their loans the way you can refinance your house, when interest rates are low or businesses refinance their loans when rates are low, if we would do that, we would literally save billions of dollars over time for people who have to borrow money to go to school.
Well, making college affordable again is a major issue on the campaign trail this year and Bernie Sanders has offered a plan for free tuition at public colleges, and Hillary Clinton has talked about how to reduce the cost of college.

I must give a presentation to my history class and am feeling anxious, but instead of using my anxiety to motivate me to practice and prepare, I begin obsessing on thoughts and images of disaster
I imagine myself flubbing my words and embarrassing myself to the point of passing out in front of the class
I started out doing very traditional research, looking at how consumers behave in traditional retail settings.
So when they go into a store how they respond to marketing stimuli like prices, advertising, displays and things like that.
How do they make the brain choices that they do?
How do they consume products?
How do they choose among different retailers?
So really essentially problems of choice and in very traditional settings.
And then I would say, perhaps in the last four or five years, I've now got really interested in internet retailing and how people connect over the internet, people connect from different communities.
Because I think a traditional retailing you face two constraints.
So constraint number one is once you locate a store in a certain region you've really defined you're trading area.
had like a handful of books, that's a little bit easier to summarize their work and to talk about them
But Walter Mosley has written and done so much, so forgive me if I'm missing major pieces of his work
So I don't know if anyone else feels this way, but when it comes to others like Walter Mosley where you're approaching them completely blind and you don't really know where to start, it can feel really overwhelming because you're just like there's so many books out there, which one do I choose
So there are a couple of different places you can start
The most obvious is to go with his Easy Rawlins series, which is his most popular series
Partially because the first book in the series, Devil in a Blue Dress, was made into a movie starring Denzel Washington
So in Devil in a Blue Dress, you are following this character named Easy Rawlins
My name is Julie Asti, I'm a Certified Financial Planner with Asti Financial Management, and today I'm going to talk about how to invest in a tax-free mutual fund.
Normally if you're going to be investing in a tax-free mutual fund, a tax-free mutual fund is going to be referring to a bond mutual fund that is going to be free from taxes, on the interest income that's going to be thrown off by the underlying bonds in the portfolio.
When investing in a tax-free mutual fund, it's going to be important to take a look at the taxes and how they're going to be handled.
For example, not all tax-free mutual funds that you're going to buy are going to be free from federal, state and local taxes.
If you live in California and you buy a tax-free New Jersey bond fund, you are going to be possibly depending on the type of fund exempt from federal taxes but because you live in California and not New Jersey the interest income from that fund is still going to be subject to state and local taxes.
Well I think that the truth is if you look at the privacy protections that we provide U.S.
consumers, they're every bit as robust as any other country in the world.
&gt;&gt; There's been a question about what the most significant innovation or development are likely to be over the next decade and I would hazard that there are two areas that need this innovation more than any other.
The first is energy.
We aren't nearly sufficient in respect of clean, sustainable forms of energy.
You know there's been broad discussions at Copenhagen, unfortunately insufficient to reach agreement on how to bring down the level of CO2 emissions.
But it does lay the basis for innovation in respect to energy.
I think that are still perceived risks that aren't quite clear and for some reason, solar is not quite there.
And for many countries that have developed a dependence on coal, wind becomes a very expensive source of energy.
My name is Julie Asti, I'm a Certified Financial Planner with Asti Financial Management and today I'm going to talk about how to invest in a money market fund.
There are really three main ways to invest in a money market fund.
The first way, maybe the most easy way is via your bank.
You ask about how the behavior of a person who may experience disability  following a brain injury, may be misinterpreted.
It can be misinterpreted many ways.
We talk about problems of awareness for people who experience disability following brain injuries, and  I see awareness as a person can't perceive, understand, and react to a situation like other people in that situation do.
It doesn't take a brain injury to have a lack of awareness.
You walk into the wrong party, you walk into the wrong situation,  and you're not going to know all the factors and you're going to be sort of the odd person out.
But we also have to talk about people and programs who are trying to work with that individual about their lack of awareness.
And what I mean by that, they don't understand how the person of focus is understanding the situation.
And much as we talk about the person who may experience disability following a brain injury not getting it because they don't understand the context of the  situation or the goals and everything,  those of us who are trying to help that person, we have to understand the world as that person sees it.
President Bob D'Andrea and the staff of the Christian Television Network join millions of believers around the world to mourn the passing of our brother Jesse Dixon.

While we offer condolences to his family, we also celebrate the rich ministry he shared with CTN for more than three decades.

Hello, my name is Emily Gasner.
I'm with Working Solutions, and I'm going to be talking about how to read a profit and loss statement.
A profit and loss statement has a few very important parts to it.
At first, at the very top of a profit and loss statement, you're going to see sales.
So those are everything you've sold, and what you sold them for.
Now I want to talk about primacy-regency, which are just really fancy terms for what comes first, and what comes last.
When you're planning your speech, and you've already pretty much decided on your organizational pattern that people are going to remember, you need to think in terms of what is the most important information I'm going to give?
On behalf of the whole House, let me say how shocked and heartbroken I am by the murder of innocent churchgoers in Charleston.
At times like this, the depth of our grief reveals the depth of our love and our resolve.
And our prayers go out to all the victims' families.
If you feel a cold coming on and need maybe some little help getting rid of it fast, we're going to try to go through that today on how to get rid of a cold fast.
I'm Dan Carlson, I'm a nurse.
Hey there, David Loughnan here from Elements Financial Planning
In today's video, I'll be talking about creating your 'Seven Essential Keys to Achieving Financial Intelligence'
It's a known fact that most Australians in today's society are time poor
Many are too busy fulfilling their simple daily tasks to even consider attending the necessary home work required to know whether their financial investments are on the right track
For most there money simply placed in savings or term deposit accounts that provides them with the illusion of security when they go to bed at night
In truth all that it's really doing is providing them with a place to store their money whilst providing them with minimal returns
Others place their money into risky investments, to make up for all the years they didn't contribute to there super savings
Others simply seem to play a game of Russian Roulette with their futures
None of which is financially smart moves, but which many have done and you know they've either been told by friends of being successful or simply they require no extra time or effort from their own busy lives already
Australians are notorious for under estimating estimating how much funds they need or are likely to need in their retirement years
Their retirement seems a distant reality, until they wake up one morning and realise retirement is just around the corner and they're going to need a lot more money than they've saved
By then however it's probably too late and, living in the luckiest country on earth won't mean anything when the government coffers are empty
Then there's the issue of Insurance or more accurately the inadequate levels of Insurance
The truth is the lack of insurance or inadequate Insurance cover, is one of the worst pit falls when it comes to protecting personal wealth and the wealth required to maintain your lifestyle
We seem to take more pride in material objects such as Insuring our cars, our homes, even our iphones rather than the ones that we love or worst still our own lives
Sadly many don't see the importance of Insuring their partner's, family or even ourselves
We simply take on the attitude that nothing's gonna happen to us and if it does we'll deal with it then ,when it happens
Protecting your lifestyle is important for many, many reasons
You want to have more options later in life, you want to live comfortably, you don't want to be dependent on the government handouts, you want to travel, enjoy the world and enjoy yourself
Sadly whilst this sounds good, many Australians are failing to make it a reality
Perhaps you have a well paying job, you might be thinking that there is nothing wrong about that
However, it only takes one simple event, only one for all that to be changed in an instant
This video is designed to get you prepared for whatever life throws your way
We believe many Australians leave themselves financially exposed and, don't take advantage of their financial opportunities
We want to help, Ok
We want you to revisit and polish up on the fundamentals
Much of what you'll learn about finance is not rocket science, but there are many conflicting opinions on the topic and so people tend to choose the easy route, do nothing
Ok the truth is you have to be smarter that that
I'll be releasing seven short videos over the coming weeks to help you gain financial control

Hello, I’m Mark Yudof.
I want to give you a quick update  on the state budget process and our advocacy efforts for the University of California.
We've seen sustainability increase dramatically over the past decade or so, as consumer demands have really shifted and aligned with their values and morals and ethics.

Emotionally intelligent people won’t set perfection as their target because they know that it doesn’t exist
Human beings, by our very nature, are fallible
When perfection is your goal, you’re always left with a nagging sense of failure that makes you want to give up or reduce your effort


You know what I'd like.

I had the opportunity to talk to a lot of Saskatchewan people this summer
And you know increasingly there's sort of these anecdotal stories of how our economy is improving even in the face of of ongoing challenges like low commodity prices
And now there's been some statistical reinforcement of those anecdotal stories, some evidence
StatsCan building permits showed Saskatchewan led the nation in terms of building permit growth 28 per cent
We're leading in terms of the pace of growth of manufacturing sales
And that's manufacturing in food processing, machinery manufacturing, chemical processing
And just today new car sales, new vehicle sales are up in Saskatchewan 6

There are still many challenges ahead
coined in the 1980s to refer to the practice of changing sides from public to private sector in the same area of activity
For instance, high military officers in the United States retired early to take well paid positions in the arms manufacturing companies they used to supervise
(iv) Certain forms of trading in influence and conflicts of interest
“Conflicts of interest” arise whenever private and public interests are in tension with each other in one and the same person
Auditors and accountants have expressed concern to the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) that auditors' consulting businesses are producing a conflict of interest, in addition to worries that other conflicts are compromising audit quality.

We have just had a wonderful conversation
I want to just tell you a little bit about why we did this
I think sometimes in celebration of Dr
What companies are trying to do, is they’re trying to take five or ten or 20 different markets and put it all under one umbrella and assume that the same kind of business model will work in every situation, when in fact it doesn’t.
So in other words, you know, the same kind of model exists whether you’re planning end of life care or planning for a pregnancy or trying to treat a chronic disease.
You know, you have the insurers playing a role in here.
This is financial adviser, Patrick Munro, talking about, what are life settlement investments?
I have received no tips before I mean thats fine, it's not really the main focus.
I'd rather focus on things I can control, like being friendly knowing the menu, delivering fast and easy service and the most important thing is that they enjoy their time with me so they'll come back

Hello everyone my name is Stephanie Moreno and I'm a Liberal Studies major
I'm financial advisor, Patrick Munro, today talking to you about fixed annuities.
Fixed annuities are a great investment for folks to consider investing in, because you have the power of triple compounding.
Really, you're able to put money away and it begins to compound; therefore, you're making money on your own money.
Because it's in an annuity, you don't have to pay taxes on the internal rate of growth, so you get another layer of growth inside the annuity; that it's not worn down by the fact that you have to pay taxes on it.

And, in networking you can get a lot of inside information about a company that might make you really want the job or make you run screaming from the room

What are the main trends in the Middle East?
In the Middle East in this year’s report we see that… in particular the Gulf States have improved in comparison to the rest of the region, where many countries have actually lost competitiveness.
This has been a trend that we have observed for about 5 years.
So when you look at the results going about to 2005 we see that that’s where the strength has started.
Why have the Gulf States gone up this year?
One of the reasons that the Gulf States have gone up this year, improvements in the macro economic environment but also improvements in the institutional environment in these countries.
and this is actually a result of longer term policies on those countries.
The oil revenues in these countries have enabled them to stabilize the macro economies and to conduct a number of important economic reforms that led to an improvement of competitiveness.
Iran and Lebanon from Middle East have been added to the rankings this year, people might be surprised to see that Iran is at number 69 mid table.
Yes, Iran is ranked for the first time this year at 69, we see in Iran that there’s a particular strength with respect with the macro economic environment where again like in the Gulf countries the hydrocarbon revenues are a big advantage.
Hi my name is Brenda Dao and I believe a hot topic in higher education today is the conversations on how do student affairs professionals, faculty and staff respond to the racial climate and injustices that students are currently facing today In specifically to students protesting and rallying together how do people in higher education respond to student’s demands and in a way create a more inclusive community I think the historic context to this is specifically has been rooted to the school desegregation and equal educational opportunity with the 1954 Brown v.

I'm Mike Campbell, with Doggie Styles, in Beverly Hills, California, and I'm here to talk about how to start your own retail business.
I think the most important aspect with starting your own business, is to find something that you truly love.
You're not going to be happy selling something that you're really not passionate about, because after a couple of years, you're going to be bored out of your mind.
You're not going to be doing as good a job as you could be.
You're not going to be as involved in the industry, and know the new trends, unless you really love that business, so the most important aspect of starting your own retail business, is to start something that you love.
With me, I had a corporate job for years, and just got bored out of my mind with it, real burnt out, so I started thinking about what I really love, what I wanted to do, and for me, I love dogs.
I've always been passionate about dogs.
I volunteer at rescue organizations, so starting a doggie boutique, seemed like a no-brainer, and to be honest, it really was a no brainer.
I didn't know a whole lot about it, when I started the business, and because I had that passion, and I think that passion comes across to my customers.

Learning at Harari got my son accepted to Columbia University!
He took AP English, both of them, AP World History and AP Latin and it was an incredible experience.
It was the first time he really waited for classes to begin.
He scored 5 in all of those exams, and all of those while attending a full-time high school.

Like I said, commercial breaks whenever I could
Probably too much, really
And then I would use heavy weights, get them up here, and really try to slow down the eccentric all the way down, and stretch, cheat them up if I had to, come down here, eccentric, and stretch all the way through
Then the same thing applies here, too
I would take a lighter weight, get in position – again, not at the same time
Just throughout the development of my arms
Building that foundation, I would get into this abbreviated position here, right there in the contraction, and I'd crank away
Probably one of the most difficult things for board members to really fully understand is the concept of inter-generational equity.
What really is that and, more importantly, particular as you deal with an institution many times led by people who are going to be shorter term people.
Remember, the relationship of the foundation is much longer term in terms of its support than the leadership of any one time of its partner institution.
They all want to deal with the point that I made earlier when I said one of the things that is important about foundation is to provide maximum sustainable support.
And so they emphasize on the word 'maximum' as opposed to the word 'sustainable.' And sustainable is the key element in there because of the concept of inter-generational equity.
What that means is while you've got money that you have today for today's generation of students you, particularly when you're managing endowments which are special kinds of funds that are handled by foundations where you invest them over the long term and only spend the earnings from those endowments.
ey everybody, so today I want to do a quick review of Fall Out Boy's new single "Immortals" which is being released for the Big Hero 6 movie soundtrack.When I think of Big Hero, I think of Guitar Hero, maybe because they have the word Hero in it.
I always found it funny that Fall Out Boy was considered pop punk because hwne i think of pop punk i think of Green Day I think of Blink 182 and I think those bands have a harder sound than Fall Out Boy has.
That being said this is probably the biggest departure we've seen from Fall Out Boy in recent history or the bands history all together.
They don't sound like a punk band or pop punk because this is like if Fall Out Boy went to the EDM category or got someone like Steve Aoki to produce this single because if you didn't hear Fall Out Boy's lead singer's voice in it you would probably wouldn't be able to recognize that it's a Fall Out Boy Song.
And also there's not very much guitars going on, so it's muted in that sense.
There's an electronic drum machine going on the whole song and it just has a souless kind of feeling And also just overall it's a very poor song.
You have a credit card, but you don't know how much you're paying in your interest.

Hey Guys! I'm Sara and I decided to create this channel to document my journey through amateur radio
I first got interested in the hobby my freshman year of college when a lot of the new friends that I had made were involved
Because of this I studied and that summer got my Technician's license
Since then I have joined K2GXT, which is the amateur radio club on my campus, and really tried to get involved in the hobby
So in the future I really just want to document this journey and share it on here so please subscribe and check out my Twitter, which @KD2GTM
My study placement that I undertook was at Bilkent University in Ankara, I studied Politics and International Relations there which I do back at Aston.
Bilkent University is a top rank University  in Turkey and I was shown through the diverse amount of modules that were available for me to choose from, things like International Relations in Movies - where we had to watch movies in lectures and then do essays about that - something that you wouldn't have been able to do back in Aston.
And it was interesting to learn Politics and International Relations through a different cultural perspective, because the way they taught the same modules that I would have done back at Aston was very very different, the way they taught it but it still was as interesting and I learned just as much as I did back at Aston.
The student body in Bilkent is very very diverse with students coming from all over the world, from different communities and different backgrounds and it was nice for everyone to mesh together to form like a family and everyone just got along really well.
Living in Turkey and being at Bilkent and living in Turkey... I gained so much experience, so much independence and I was able to prove to myself that I can live in a country by myself.
How to approach customers?
Two things must be done before approaching customers.
First, a clearly defined description of the product or service you sell must be constructed.
Hi this is Ryan Tapp on behalf of Expert Village and this is smack talking through broadcasting.
Although smack talking through broadcasting will use the same general tools that you would use when smack talking through technology.
It is not the same thing you see when you broadcast you smack talk using broadcasting you are really just humiliating your opponent in front in a large audience where as through technology it was more using the technology to sike them out.
In this section we'll be discussing another model known as the ABCs of customer service.
I'm Pamela Unruh on behalf of Expert Village.
I think it's also important just to make a point as we discuss business oriented environments and customer oriented service.
So, you are interested in possibly filling out a Walmart application right?
Well, you have come to the right place.
I don’t work for Walmart, nor am I hired by them to make this video.
Although working for Walmart is a positive choice, I’m sure you agree it’s best to be properly prepared before you go ahead and rush to fill out the Walmart application form.
I hope that by using my non-biased information, so you can make an informed decision before filling out your job application form.
After you watch this short video, you can find all my research I have gathered for you at walmartjobsguide.com.
The link is listed just below this video in the description area.
Here are just a few important things to make note of when applying to Walmart.
• Walmart does not provide a printable job application.
You must apply online which I provide the link on my website.
• Some of the common positions at Walmart are a greeter, cashier, store associate, customer service, trust driver, tire sales, automotive technician, beauty sales, assistant store manager, pharmacist, optometrist and many others which I list on my site.
• You must be 16 years old.
So, another question that I often get asked is How do you become a motivational speaker?
And I think it's an interesting thought.
I don't think anybody actually becomes a motivational speaker without one major thing and that is desire.
It is not something that comes easy in the sense, I don't mean that your desire doesn't come easy, but I think once you have that desire the pursuit of actually becoming a motivational speaker, a speaker that draws an audience, is something that can be difficult and it can be trying.
So relationships are absolutely key to our business.
We’re in a high service arena.
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEGUN TO WONDER WHAT TRUMP WILL DO IN THE LIKELY SCENARIO THAT HE WILL LOSE THE ELECTION, AND THE UNLIKELY SCENARIO THAT HE ADMITS IT
( LAUGHTER ) RESPECTS THIS-- THIS HAS JUST COME OUT-- REPORT REPORTS ARE THAT DONALD TRUMP IS, THINKING ABOUT STARTING A DONALD TRUMP TV NETWORK
UNTIL NOW, THE ONLY PLACE YOU COULD SEE 24 HOURS OF DONALD TRUMP WAS CNN
AND THE TRUMP RUMORS MIGHT BE TRUE, BECAUSE ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN LIVE-STREAMED THEIR OWN DEBATE COVERAGE UNDER THE HEADING #TRUMPTV
THIS IS EXCITING, A BRAND NEW TRUMP BUSINESS VENTURE

Moss is known for her marathon parties, but this was her first multi-day extravaganza
And according to Vogue, Moss intended the memories to last a lifetime: guests could get a commemorative tattoo right there at the party
Paris Hilton's 21st birthday Like Kate Moss, Paris Hilton doesn't go halfway on her birthday bashes, which may explain why the hotel heiress dragged invitees around the world to five different locales for her 21st birthday
Jack tells the camera something he will never ever forget
He tells of the last time he visited his grandma at the Hospital and after a long time of talking and catching up together, Jack's unknowing Grandma asks where he is and when he'll be getting there
This means that she has forgotten That he had actually been talking to her the whole time, which is obviously heartbreaking
She unfortunately passed away some weeks later with her battle with her illness
This is sad because It reminds me of the the last few days when my granny was alive And she didn't die of cancer or anything but she, she was locked away in like a hospital for the last few months of her life and She didn't really recognize anybody anymore
Hey everybody Chris the English teacher here
Today, I want to teach you guys about three different expressions that American English speakers use to say "how are you" basically
The first one is "what's up?" We use "what's up?", and it kind of means "What's happening" so for example if I say "what's up?" The other person will say, "Oh not much
I'm just hanging out here
" The correct response is going to be "not much
" We never ever say "fine" or "good" After "what's up?" Next we have "how's it going?" "How's it going?" is one that basically means "How are you?" or "How is your life going?" Here you would respond, "Oh, it's fine

I'm okay" etc Finally we have "what's going on?" "What's going on?" is basically the same thing as "what's up?", so here again We would respond "not much"
Remember in American English, When you see somebody and they ask you, like, "how are you?" "What's up?" "How's it going?" This is not a time to talk about like depressing stuff
Everyone is always positive like everything is great all the time

So she is admitted now

I hope to be able to carry more patients at a time
But 4 is, I think, my max for now

It makes time go by faster and it's like an enjoyable time

So guys, the question I get the most often, is "what is the most important thing to grow a YouTube channel?" And the number one most important thing is being consistent.
And this is really across the board, but I would say the most important thing is really deciding how often you're going to upload your videos.
So, you need to decide what's right for you.
You know, some YouTubers upload several times a day, some do it just once a month, but you have to decide what your schedule can be - and be realistic about it.
My name is Maria Enomoto from Consumer Credit Counseling Service and we're going to discuss on how to apply for free government grants, loans or scholarships.
Probably you must know or somebody has told you that the government has some funds to be set on some specific issues, like housing, education.

There are definitely days when I have a lot of sleep and I've taken couple naps in internal medicine
The way the software works for my watch is it will add in all the naps as part of your sleep
I think that's why I have all these upward bumps in internal medicine

So that's all the data I have so far on how much sleep I'm getting in med school
I'll try to do an update video in the future when I'm down with med school and I wanna make two disclaimers before I end the video
So the last thing about an Accordion has to do with prices.
A brand new instrument can cost certainly several hundred dollars.
Sometimes several thousand dollars for a new instrument and your probably not going to be to interested in that till you really become a player and you decide you want a quality instrument.
For a used instrument, depending on where you buy one from, if you get an Accordion from an Accordion dealer that has gone through it and has cleaned it and has gone through adjusted all the reeds and it has been tuned and somebody who knows what they are doing.

we scrutinize what governments, what parliaments do and for that you need independence
We are only bound by human rights - that is our standard, that's what we apply in our work
We help the states to implement their obligations towards all human beings and their countries
Independence is essential to our legitimacy
One of the things that we need to do is to make critique of governments and we need to be held to account by society and by the international community
In order for us to do that effectively we need to be independent and we need to be perceived to be independent

Hello guys, welcome to my channel   today i want to discuss about some questions that i receive from my lecture the first question is: Why is online banking useful ? Online banking is useful because, it is more efficient than an oldschool banking.
peoples only need internet connection to check their credit or transfer their money to another account The second  question is: What topics can people research online ? I think, so many topics that people can research on internet or online on internet people can search about education, politic, social life, technical tips, and many more.
The thing that excites me the most about the future is the use of data that we're gathering.
If you think about what we do: we install card access,  censors,  video sensors, burglar alarm sensors... their gathering reams and reams and reams of data was just sitting there not being used  unless something bad happens, and we need to do a forensic look at it.
Now, starting to take that data put into business intelligence systems and they can be data mined and be used for operational improvement, instead of just forensic investigation.
Once you get to that, that's the Holy Grail.
Welcome to Economics for Decision Makers Economics is the social science of choices, whether that choice is made by a person, a firm, or a government.
It is a science, in that economists try to explain and rationalize behavior through models and assumption testing.
Hey guys! My name is Ashley, and I've been going to the Walton Clinic for a few months now
I went in because I was experiencing some neck pain and some neck stiffness
After an evaluation with Dr
Matt, he saw that the natural curve in my neck was actually straight
And, so he set up a plan for me to have some appointments
And, after a week I had full range of motion back in my neck
And, after month I had no pain
I'm actually the third generation to go to the Walton Clinic
And, me and my family cannot say enough good things about them
I bet they're really devastated to see their kid's school going into the gutter, and they're just looking for someone to blame
Our challenge is to find the compassion for others that we want them to have for us
That is emotional correctness
I'm not saying it's easy
An average of, like, 5
6 times per day I have to stop myself from responding to all of my hate mail with a flurry of vile profanities
This whole finding compassion and common ground with your enemies thing is kind of like a political-spiritual practice for me, and I ain't the Dalai Lama
I'm not perfect, but what I am is optimistic
I have thought about it
I seriously considered buying a turnkey
I went through the process of an initial interview, talked on the phone with a turnkey company—really a great experience
They gave me a ton of information, showed me examples of some properties, what returns would be, you know, all the costs they consider—maintenance, vacancies—all of that, taxes, insurance
But ultimately it came down to, I‘m still able to buy properties in my area in Colorado 20 percent below market value, and I can usually get between 15 and 20 percent cash on cash returns
So, for recruiters that may be new to recruitment marketing, every one of you has a tool that has incredible visibility, even today, that is one of your leading recruitment marketing tools that you may not even be aware of, and that’s job descriptions
Job descriptions are sadly, one of the least involved tools in our recruiting playbook
Though they’re one of the resources, one of the recruitment marketing vehicles have done right, that have more reach than most anything we do
So, instead of taking that template job description off the shelf and reusing that for your next hire, you know, look at the job description, look for opportunities where you can actually tweak that and make that more appealing to the audience you’re trying to connect with
A lot of ATSs these days actually have increased some of their functionality so you can do things like embedding photos and images inside of job descriptions, embedding videos, adding hyperlinks
All these things will make your job descriptions more appealing to job seekers
It’ll help you tell the story that you’re trying to tell beyond just the core duties and responsibilities of that job description, and bring them to life even more which will ultimately help you create a more informed applicant and attract the right applicant
Another thing that you should really consider is the copy of the job description
This to me is really one of the biggest things that hold recruiting organisations back, because again, you rely on old templates that were likely written by a hiring manager, that’s an unrealistic laundry list of responsibilities and qualifications, and it’s something that a job seeker is not going to want to take the time to go through, particularly a passive job seeker, and even more particularly, a passive job seeker or any job seeker who is looking at that job description on a mobile device, which, for many organisations, is more than half of your potential audience, is reading that job description
So, when you’re re-thinking the copy of that job description from a recruitment marketing standpoint, think about copy
Write your job description as if it’s mobile first
Assume that your ideal applicants are going to be viewing that on a mobile device, so you need to make it lean, and then, when you’re actually working on the copy, instead of using terms like “we, our, me,” use terms around “you
” Frame the job description around the actual reader
Allow them to see themselves in that job
Use “you, your, and yours,” so a reader can actually see themselves in that role, and, when you’re writing the role, don’t write it from a compliance standpoint so that it’s just written in a way that checks all the boxes but doesn’t actually compel me to apply; write that job description as if you’re sitting across the table from your very best candidate
How are you conveying that job to them in a way that’s going to get them excited and help you close them? That spirit is what you should be taking into the job description and into the copy that you’re writing, to actually build something that is going to actually compel people to convert, and in this case conversion will be applying to that actual job
You know that can not even be a public or famous person your opinion in the network have much strength and be heard by all.

Why don't I ask them what helped them succeed, and find out what really leads to success for everyone
So I was all excited to get out there and start talking to these great people, when the self-doubt set in
I mean, why would people want to talk to me
I'm not a famous journalist
I'm not even a journalist
So I was ready to stop the project before it even began, when who comes walking towards me but Ben Cohen, the famous co-founder of Ben and Jerry's ice cream
I figured it was now or never
I pushed through the self-doubt, jumped out in front of him, and said, "Ben, I'm working on this project
I don't even know what to ask you, but can you tell me what helped you succeed
" He said, "Yeah, sure, come on
Let's go for a coffee
" And over coffee and ice cream, Ben told me his story
AUDREY SIEGEL: One of things I'm really looking forward to in 2010 and probably early in 2011 is the e-reader.
I think that this is going to change the way that consumers consume content for lack of a better word.
I always hate when I put the same word twice in a sentence.
Hi, I am J and today’s topic is “EMC E20-390 exam and its preparation” first of all I will discuss about E20-390 exam related skills and technologies.
Afterwards I will share my personal experience how you can reduce your chances of failure in EMC E20-390 exam which is related to “EMC VNX Solutions Specialist” and credits towards “EMC VNX Solutions Specialist for Implementation Engineers” Certification.
Let’s get started This exam focuses on the knowledge and activities involved in implementing VNX Series Block-based SAN solutions and File-based NAS solutions in heterogeneous virtualized open systems environments.
So as second step tell your opponent about a person who not only agrees with your opinion but that person should also hold authority in eyes of your opponent
For example, when Ghost Busters 2016 movie trailer became the most hated movie trailer on YouTube, director Paul Feig and feminist groups started calling it misogyny
But as response men bloggers argued by telling it ain't misogyny due to which it is receiving so much dislike
This is Patrick Munro financial adviser talking about comparing home equity loan rates.
It's important when you take out a loan from any financial institution for any reason that you compare the loan rates that are available between the institutions.
And home equity lines of credit are no different.
Alright, let's talk about the advantages of extemporaneous speaking.
First, this is, probably, the most useful presentation style for almost all of your situations.
Whether it be at work or whether it be in a classroom setting, those settings are moderate in formality.
That is one of the reasons why extemporaneous speaking is the best choice because it's not too formal and it's not too casual.
Formal would, much more, be your manuscript speaking and informal would be, much more, for your impromptu speaking.
Ok so you've placed the bagua in your space and you figured out where the creativity area is.
Now keep in mind that you can have an overall creativity area and that one you will find by standing in the front door to your house or your apartment.
And the area to the right of the entire house will be the creativity area.
But you can also figure out where the creativity area is in a particular room.
Raising a gentleman can be a little bit hard.
I can tell you, I have two boys of my own.
You have recently become an investor in corporations on Wall Street and you're following them more closely now and you're hearing more and more how do they pierce the corporate veil?
What does that mean?
NATO has now decided to launch an operation to enforce the arms embargo against Libya.
All Allies are committed to meet their responsibilities under the United Nations resolution to stop the intolerable violence against Libyan civilians.
Our top operational commander, Admiral Stavridis, is activating NATO ships and aircraft in the Central Mediterranean.
They will conduct operations to monitor, report and, if needed, interdict vessels suspected of carrying illegal arms or mercenaries.
This will be done in close coordination with commercial shipping and regional organisations.
And we will welcome contributions from NATO partners to our common endeavour.
At the same time, NATO has completed plans to help enforce the no-fly zone - to bring our contribution, if needed, in a clearly defined manner, to the broad international effort to protect the people of Libya from the violence of the Gaddafi regime.
I just completed an in-depth, very frank, and thorough discussion with President Kiir.
And throughout the meeting, I think it's fair to say that both of us spoke very candidly, very directly, and we got to the issues that I came here to discuss.
Throughout the meeting, I made it clear to him that he needs to do everything in his power to end the violence, and also to begin a process of national dialogue, a process by which there is the beginning of discussions - real discussions - about a transition government that can bring peace to the country.
It's fair to say that President Kiir was very open and very thoughtful and had thought even before this meeting about these issues.
In this video you will discover how to create more freedom with the Ameriplan business opportunity.
Hi everybody, Joe Barclay here.
And today's message is for those looking to create more time and money freedom.
I believe that the economic climate is hopefully, you know, making a turn for the better.
But I think it’s very, very important, again, back to the point of no advertising campaign being an island, no advertiser really needs to be an island or should-- can not be an island themselves.
&gt;&gt; So are role models important?
I think not only are they important they are vital.
We got Wario World Touch
Let me know in the comments if you guys remember Nintendo
Alright, we're gettin' started

It's actually a game that I'm gonna be taking on upcoming trips soon just cuz it's fun to kinda get back with the oldies
The last thing we got, and definitely my favorite, is allegedly what's gonna allow us to watch TV for days
So we already talked about the most difficult day as a motivational speaker.
I think couple other things come to mind, maybe the funniest thing that ever happened to me as a motivational speaker, and I would say it was early on in my career, I've already done my very first pay job and I was asked here locally in Waller Creek, California, to do an hour and a half speech for no money on being a great listing agent, which is, you know, listing people's properties.
Well, the class was to be ended up by, I set the class up to be a three-hour class and I was going to deliver some extra information and I figured that after about an hour, hour and fifteen minutes, I would give the class a break to use the restroom and then I would finish up the class.
Well, sure enough the first break comes and the class coincidentally, and we still up to this date, don't know why, was majority women and sure enough on the first break, I had a lady who is English, she had an English background and spoke with an English accent, come up to tell me that my zipper had been down during the first hour and fifteen minutes of the class.
And she said that it was tough for the students to concentrate on my speaking and the stuff that I was delivering while my zipper was down, and would I please correct that situation.
Hey guys, how you doing? It's Matt Talbot here in the Non-prime office at Sherwood Dodge just making a quick video here

Generally speaking, you are all consider yourselves peers
You have a roommate
Unless your roommate is like Michael Jordan you pretty much would consider yourself of all fairly equal
Now, you would be consider inferior relatively speaking if you are of a lower status in those around you
Let say you are a student and you’re referring yourself of to your teacher
Your teacher in that scenario will have a higher status than you
Or you would have a lower status than your teacher
Now, the flip side is if you are engaging with somebody who has a higher status
So let say the CEO of the company
Or in this scenario this example that we have here, we have a drill sergeant and one of the cadets
He would be definitely of a higher status
He is the one making doing the push-ups right


We have our swan We have our Pinkie Pie and look at her rowing Going down the ocean, going down the river Look at her work, this is adorable

Being appreciative is very important and it says a lot about yourself.
Okay, we're talking about different styles of improv comedy, and the more you learn about improv the more you'll find out there's these different kinds you can study.
What I want to talk to you about now is narrative long form.
That's a kind of long form improv, long form meaning scenes that are related together instead of disconnected, and these scenes are connected by a story.
In a narrative long form you get to follow characters along a journey, or follow a location or a group of people as they evolve.
There are actually not many disadvantages to extemporaneous speaking.
The main one would be that you run the chance of groping for words.
Like, you get lost, you'll lose your place or you'll forget for a moment, but there's a really easy way to prevent that.
That is with a lot of rehearsal or a lot of practice.
I had a large diamond that I wanted to sell, and it was from a relationship that I'm no longer in.
So I figured I might as well cash some money out of it, rather than just letting it sit around.
But I had no idea who even buys jewelry in San Diego.
So I got my 21-year-old to go online and do some research, and he came back with San Diego Jewelry Finders or Buyers, San Diego Jewelry Buyers.
He said that he did similar to like a Zagat, and that they were the best out of all of them in San Diego.
And because the kids are good with computers, I believed him.
So we ended up making an appointment, came down, met a guy named Timothy, who is a gemologist.
I had some other pieces that I was thinking about maybe selling, but a lot of them were family heirloom type jewelry.
This one is one of them.
He said if this one was not a laboratory grown ruby, it would have been worth a half a million dollars  Grandma, they would have owned it.
So I kept it, and I thought that that part of it really made me feel even more comfortable and confident, the fact that he wasn't trying to buy everything.
You know, the big diamond, which was the one that I knew was probably worth something, was the one that he was more interested in, as well he should be.
Now my son, being the computer savvy person that he is, is sitting next to me while Timothy is getting the numbers for what that diamond is worth.
And he shows me on his phone, wholesale.
When I came to Aston, I was able to take Spanish as part of the University Wide Language Programme which is really great because it enabled me to find a study placement in Spain.
I went to the University of Granada where I had to take classes in Spanish, and that was challenging at first but people are very friendly, the classes were small so it wasn't too intimidating to ask questions and overall the social aspect in Granada was really great.
In this video you’re going to discover what a marketing trip wire is.
Before I get into that, if you’d like to know some advanced insider tactics that people are using right now to get 248% ROI on their ads, I’ve got a special video for you, just click the link that’s below right now.
Marketing trip wire is basically a low ticket product offering that solves a specific problem in your prospects life, and you put it at such a low price and you add such high value to it, that it becomes an irresistible offer.
And really what it’s meant to do is just take people that are prospects that have just opted in on your email list and haven’t bought anything, and turn them into buyers as quickly as possible.
Because once somebody has opened up their wallet and bought from you, then you have a much higher chance of selling them other things on the backend.
So that’s why you’ll see a lot of funnels these days will start with like a $7-$17 product and then they move people up the chain to higher products because once they’ve bought from you, they’ve gotten to experience the value that you can provide to them, with very low resistance, then they’ll develop that trust with you and their willing to buy some of your higher end products from you down the road.
One thing that you need to understand is that online advertising is becoming increasingly difficult to pull off successfully using the traditional methods because people are simply becoming blind to them.
The most effective way to combat this is using native advertisements which is just a fancy term for ads that look similar to the content around them.
It sounds counter-intuitive, but the best way to get noticed is to actually blend in.
Think of soap operas and infomercials.
They are the original native ads and have been running successfully for decades, selling billions of dollars of products.
Now if you want to start leveraging native ads, there’s two choices you can make.

Hi there, Seb here, and if you are looking for tips on Total Life Changes business cards and some tips on how to use them you are definitely in the right place and if you want some more training on hot to build your TLC business and generate some more sales you can go on my website here at any time but in this video I wanna give you some tips that will help you to get more contacts for your business and expose your business to more people
So my favourite place to order business cards is Vista Print, a very reliable company, they haven�t failed me yet
I�ve had tons of orders through them they have served me for years
I would recommend ordering through Vista Print and there is a link in my video description inbox if you haven�t actually got a link already of where to buy business cards
Now the next thing we do is that we network locally in order to hand these business cards out
Go to networking functions
Look locally and see if there is anything for local business owners
There must be something in your area or maybe you have to travel a bit but it�s definitely worth networking, gong to these events at least once a month
Now the problem is, most networkers in TLC and other companies, they will go into these networking events and they will just throw up information
They will find any living breathing soul and just tell them all about their business
This is the wrong way to go about it, you want people asking you what you do and you wanna make it interesting so instead of you saying, �I am a distributor in TLC,� what you wanna say is, �I get paid�
� Maybe you can say something like this, �I get paid to help people lose weight
� So that�s actually quite interesting and then people can ask you more and you just tell them but in snippets of information
And they will say well, how does that work then? And you would say, �well one we help customer lose X amount of weight in X amount of time
� And you keep it short and sweet because the shorter you keep it, less is more especially in networking
You want people asking you questions and you are able to just give them small snippets of information and if they are really interested then you can have them take a look at your website or video or something like that
Now the next thing you wanna do is actually personalize these Total Life Changes business cards
My favourite thing to do, I�m not actually in TLC by the way, I�m in another company but my favourite thing on flyers that I hand out for my network marketing business is, I like to put my picture on the flyer, so when I speak to this person and we have a conversation, they�ll take the flyer home, they�ll see my picture and the rapport is kind of regained because they will actually�
They will remember me just from seeing my picture
They remember that conversation
That can be a real great way to personalize and also stand out from the crowd
Now the final thing you wanna do is gather as many business cards as possible
I didn�t want this to happen but this is probably the most important thing you should do and then follow up with these people afterwards
Give them a call and just ask them, �Hey, are you open to additional streams of income? You know, you can probably phrase it a little bit better than that but actually follow up with these people saying, �Hey, you know we had a conversation about TLC or whatever and I just want to follow up and just to see if you are actually open to what we�re doing business wise
You know, would you be open to a side project that wouldn�t interfere with what you are currently doing? Very easy line and you get a yes or maybe you can take it from there
I did some videos on how to deal with in terms of answers to that question but this information should help you here in today
So if you like these tips make sure you go to my website, http://MLMSuccessWithSeb
com where you will get 10 tips on how to generate leads for free starting today and I really look forward to helping you out further in more of my videos
CHRISTI HILL: You absolutely need to be a part of the conversation.
You have to get comfortable with the ambiguity of not being able to control what the conversation is.
It is two way, not one way, and then looking at it as multiple ways.
So being able to understand that, and respect that, within the consumer experience, and what you test, what you pilot is not necessarily what gets replicated when you go to mass.
And individual's perspectives becomes the perspective of the brand very quickly.
According to "Project Blue: Capitalising on the rise and interconnectivity of the emerging markets" published recently by PwC, rapidly accelerating growth and increased intra-trading across South America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East (SAAAME) is leading to a radical shake-up in the competitive environment for financial services businesses, both within the SAAAME region and beyond.
Dominic Nixon, Asia Financial Services Leader at PwC comments: "The real story is not so much the speed of growth within SAAAME, but how interconnected the trade flows between these markets have become." she says.

Now often times, not too long after you've started your band, started performing, started being an artist.
You'll have some magazine, some newspaper, something like that.
Maybe it’s a record label come along and say, "Hey.
If you pay us this amount of money, we'll give you this amount of space in our magazine.
Or we'll give you a song on our upcoming demo CD.” Or something, and the artist thinks, wow, I get to be in a magazine, right?
And you start thinking, oh but I'm not sure five hundred dollars seems like a lot to pay for an ad that's about the size of an over sized pea in a magazine.

I also had interacted with enough health care professionals both in the Austin and San Antonio area to you know recognize that San Antonio is a great place for getting good clinical experience in good clinical practice
Not that you wouldn't get that in Austin but San Antonio is just a much larger market, it's got a unique population, and the reputation that UT Health Science Center's School of Nursing had in Texas-- I heard very good things about it and I'd also met nurses in the Austin area who'd also am graduated from the program and had nice things to say about it
So for me, between the idea of coming to a place that would have you know great opportunities for clinical practice, with also tuition that was subsidized by the state
As you know all Health Science Centers in Texas charge about a third less than your typical state university systems do
So you know that was also an added bonus, I also knew that San Antonio was a military town

But really, it's a true sign that Vegeta's growing up

That's grown up stuff for a guy who was all about himself not that many years ago
His atoning for his past sins is a truly remarkable and poignant moment in Dragon Ball
Those don't come often, but when they do

Now we've got Super, and Vegeta's just as grump ever
But there's actually something different about him
He's a lot more relaxed and more willing to spend time with his family

This is Patrick Munro discussing what is the penalty for cashing in a 401K early.
A 401k is a governmental retirement program designed to allow working employees to put away money for retirement and not pay any taxes on the growth of that money.
It's a privilege to have a 401k, the government grants you the privilege and if you don't have to pay taxes on the money, it will grow even quicker.
However some individuals have, basically have problems with their cash flow and they have to collapse their investment.

Hi, my name is Paul Adams and I'm President of Sound Financial Group You're probably watching this video because you had some interest in looking at a career as a financial professional I just thought I'd share with you the three major benefits that exist as a part of being in our industry
That's freedom, opportunity an autonomy
You see, people who join the industry as a financial professional have a tremendous opportunity to build a business
They can build a business that drives the financial outcomes that they need to live the life that they wanna live They have the freedom to choose when and where they want to work, and they have the autonomy to choose who is that they want to work with
So, imagine being able to build a career for the next two, three, or four decades where everybody you work with you call friend
We call that building a good life for the rest your life

Yes, it's best if you coat Western Red Cedar siding on all six sides.
I think a big part of this is not having a fixed idea about how a person might do a thing that needs doing
I think, you know, obviously in our heads we use a lot of shortcuts in our brains
We think an accountant looks a certain way and talks a certain way and dresses a certain way
And when we see a person who does that, we think, yeah, that person's totally going to be a great accountant
So we think the same
We can picture a developer, designer
We can picture a manager
We kind of know what, what all these people look like in our heads
And that influences who we pick to do these roles
In a previous career, my manager hired a guy for a sales role
And I remember laughing to myself
I was like, this guy won't last a week
He was so quiet and shy and you could barely hear him when he spoke, and that wasn't very often
And sales is really macho, you know


if you feel that anger is coming up, is coming up from down there in the bottom of our consciousness
So when the storm is about to break out, we know
We feel signs of the storm
So we have to prepare in order to be able to resist, to deal with the storm
Yeah, the campaign for real beauty was really breakthrough.
It started in 2004 and I think the reason why it was so innovative was it’s actually built on three pillars.
We spend an exorbitant amount of time speaking to women and understanding what they're looking for.
Two, we challenge beauty stereotypes.
So, we helped women understand or encouraged them to believe that that beauty is more than just being young, skinny, and blonde.

NARRATOR: And achieving meaningful use provides incentives
PATRICK HAMILTON: Congress and CMS have acknowledged the fact that there is a resource commitment that is available and that providers should take advantage of the money that Congress has made available through the Recovery Act so that they can be incentivized in order to implement these electronic health records and actually use them in a meaningful way
In terms of the incentive program, I always tell doctors who are a little bit hesitant or resistant to the idea of change and the implementation of electronic health records that in 10 to 20 years, we're really not going to be having this discussion any further
This is really the wave of the not-too-distant future

Number One: As a Project Manager you have to educate yourself because there is so much written on teams and team conflicts so there are multiple resources you can access
The best place to start is to Google
Number Two: Educate your team
Just educating people to let them know that this will occur and when is very helpful
Let the team know ‘Hey, this is normal

Hello, I'm Cheri Ashwood.
I'm a guidance counselor, and today I'm going to tell you how to get a student loan with no credit history or co-signer.
of the differences between these courses so you can make an informed decision about which capstone course you want to choose
Starting with EDGR 698, Action Research
Action Research is something that every teacher does throughout the course of their career, whether they know they're actually doing Action Research or not
Now it's important to note that you don't have to be a teacher in classroom to do Action Research
You can sign up for this even if you're not in the classroom
What I suggest you do for all these is take a look at MED capstone pamphlet
There's some detailed information in there
After you've done that, we can make a decision based on what I have here
So what does Action Research do
We find a problem at a local level
When I say a local level, I don't mean your community
I don't mean your city
As a teacher I believe there is a need to make accommodations for all learners.
Prior to these courses, though the @One Certification Program I thought my grasp on Accessibility was strong.
I was required to include a disability statement and phone number on my syllabus so students could make their own arrangements.
My thought was yes things should be made accessible but that wasn’t my responsibility.
There was an office and they knew what to do.
This was unrealistic and immature.
Through this course I learned it was also my responsibility to work with the campus disability office and the student.
Making sure their needs were being met.

I will do that too

Well, I talk to my friends and the people I know about these issues
Just helping to spread the awareness

You made me aware of the way we treat animals
If you can minimize your own impact on the lives of the animals, and also ask your friends to do it, you’ll be making a great difference, Nina

So my name is William Knowlman and I study Maths and Spanish at Aston University and I was lucky enough to find a placement with Pricewaterhouse Coopers which is a tax and audit firm in Chile.
now Chile is a country I don't know a huge amount about before going there but what I realised upon arriving is it's actually got fantastic opportunities for graduates that can speak English and Spanish, or are bilingual.
And this is because there's plenty of multinational companies out there crying out for graduates that speak two languages.
I think the best thing that I got out of my placement was obviously the Spanish-speaking.
I found... immersed in the culture, perhaps the culture doesn't speak as much English as you'd find in Europe, really helped me grasp the language.
It was something that was rather nerve-wracking at first but really helped me and I find myself in quite a strong position finishing my degree and also a good position to return to a Spanish-speaking country.
I think working in Price has give me a good... gap bridger between doing a maths degree and going into business which is now - from the placement - something I've realised I want to do.
It's perfect - it's given me the tools in tax, in Excel and things like that and a bit of knowledge, background knowledge that I can use in the business and I hope that this will be able to bring me into a job, incorporating all these skills that I've learned on placement.

Mary Barbara, autism mom, board certified behavior analyst, and best-selling author
Last week, my video blog was all about not overusing a child's name, especially when placing a demand or saying no
But we want our clients and children to learn to respond to their names when called which is a huge skill that many children with autism struggle with
A child not responding to his name once called can be one of the first hallmark signs of autism
This is considered a red flag on the Modified Checklist for Autism and toddlers or the M-Chat and a diagnostic indicator on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule known as the ADOS
So since many children with autism have difficulty responding to their name, I thought I would address it in this week's video blog
I created and have used the following procedure to teach children to respond to their names with dozens of children with autism and have found it to be very successful
The key here is to pair the child's name with improving conditions, which is called reinforcement
Since any behavior that's reinforced should maintain or increase
The following is an excerpt from page 106 of my book, "The Verbal Behavior Approach
" First, tell everyone in the environment to stop using or limit the use of the child's name throughout the day
Most importantly, as I said last week in the last video blog, do not link the child's name to demands such as "Dennis go get your shoes," "Dennis come here
" Limiting the use of the child's name will actually help him to learn to respond to his name when called because he won't tune you out as part of a long list of demands
Next, gather several of Dennis's reinforcers which should be his strongest consumable or controllable reinforcers, such as chips or bubbles and then go behind him when he's engaged in another activity, you have your chips and bubbles, call his name while standing behind him and then immediately touch a shoulder and hand him a chip or blow the bubbles
Gradually fade your prompts by standing a foot or two farther away and by delaying the touching of a shoulder by a second or two
By using this procedure, Dennis will learn that when he hear's his name good things happen
For best results, I recommend using this procedure in both the home and school environments and I also recommend taking data every trial for 10 or 20 trials per day so that your distance and the reinforcement can be systematically faded out and your client will become more successful with responding to his name

Ah-having said that-ah-I think that we are seeing this meltdown, but I see this meltdown for good.
I think that what is happening now is-we're forcing back to ethics.
We lost track-not we-I mean, I don't want to generalize-but the system lost track of ethics.
One of the things today with the-- with multi platform distribution outlets and numerous media types that are out there, advertisers and their agencies really have to-- really have to think about all of these platforms early in their origination of their communications messages.
So really the idea is today, no communications message, no advertising campaign is an island.

Because Earth is our point of departure
It is where we live and it's how we understand other worlds out there—potentially, exoplanets around other suns
So it's our job, through an improving, growing space communications infrastructure, to bring the data back from Earth
In some cases, terabytes a day to understand this planet
The other thing that's very important about the Earth is our planet lives in space
We live in space
As our planet lives in space, we need to be more situationally aware what space does to our world
We interact with the Sun, and we interact with the collisional debris of our solar system
That cosmic collisional debris produces signatures in the climate record of our planet
And yet, we are just literally at the precipice of understanding what is out there
Today, we understand where our planet is collided with by pieces of asteroids and comets
&gt;&gt; Okay, well, there's been a lot of discussion here about the Middle East.
I was on the panel on the balance of power in the Middle East yesterday because one of the world's most retractible problems is the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians that's went on for such a long time.
So there is a lot of discussion here about what to do about that because the Palestinian Prime Minister, Mr. Fayyad, the Prime Minister of Jordan, the King of Jordan is coming here.
And we are really looking in the coming year for some new impetus behind the Middle East peace process.
One of the reasons that Kathi was so good to work with was that her...was how professional she is and how organized she is, that's her job.
And she stayed in constant communication with me so it was very easy to have her as a performer and I would have her back at any time and I would recommend her to any of you who would have her for a library seminar.
Well Kathi and I met at a downtown [inaudible] meeting earlier, and we were talking about what she did and it sounded like a really good fit for the kinds of things people are interested in, in the general population.
So we talked about having something at the [inaudible] Library and this was the day that we set up to have it and it was a fantastic success.
We had 55 people here, which was really good for a library talk on a Saturday morning, people have a lot to do.

In the natural resources and energy field there's a strong emphasis now on evaluating whether certain policies or programs are doing what they should do
The number of programs in the energy field that are being rolled out to encourage energy conservation and energy efficiency has been exploding recently
The Opower program is a behavioral program in which residential customers get what are called Home Energy Reports
These Home Energy Reports give the individual information about tips on energy use
It tells them how they’re doing compared to their past energy use, and compares their energy use to that of their neighbors
And the idea is to try to nudge these customers to saving energy
And we tease out the effect of the program by comparing - by statistically comparing the energy use of the treatment customers - the customers getting these Home Energy Reports – and the customers who don’t

I have run a successful legal nurse consulting business since 1989. I mentor nurses who want to become legal nurse consultants.
This is a tip about the legal nurse consultants role in attending an IME It is also known as an independent medical examination.
Some attorneys also refer to it as the insurance medical examination or the defense medical examination or DME these exams may have a different name in your state.
Most attorneys may be familiar with the idea of an LNC attending an IME but some need to be sold on the benefits and purpose of having an LNC be there instead of an attorney, paralegal or secretary.

You can get it over the counter and it's become recently available now in many countries as an OTC or over-the-counter drug, but why would you want to take a drug like this over the counter without seeing a doctor.
Fluconazole's quite a powerful drug with many potential side effects.
If you go to many databases online, you can read about all the nasty side effects from diflucan or fluconazole.
It has some very powerful effects on the liver.
So my advice to you if you must take this drug is to take it in a very short period of time and certainly don't repeatedly take this drug.
Once you've finished your course, ask your naturopath or health care professional if you can go on a course of St.
Mary Thistle, a good herb to help mop up any liver toxins.
Sneezing is a very normal thing to do and unpredictable.
But, we can try to do it as most delicately and politely as possible.
Hi, I'm Hazely Lopez, Director of Hazely Academy of Refinement and Modeling and I'm here to talk to you about how to sneeze properly.
It's important now that we look at this.
And so with the challenges for marketers is to be able to understand, again, this very difficult issue of giving up control of the brand in order to allow for consumers to have more power to communicate about the brand at a much faster rate.
And in that co-production model, co-branding kind of model, it's going to be important for companies to be aware of how to use that, how to use social media in the right way.
DAVID KIRKPATRICK: We're moving towards a world where even your television advertising is going to be influenced by the dialogue you're having with consumers in Facebook, or if Google launches its own social network, or in Twitter, or wherever.
because the Bible says creationism is the truth
" And I think that's so telling right there
And I realized there may be a lot of people out there who had no idea how not based in science Ken Ham's views were
And when you expose that nonsense to the masses, that probably benefited the scientific community
Like, "Oh, this is the hyped debate
This is the best the other side has to offer and it was horrible
" And maybe that exposure of someone who has such a silly idea is what we need
And I was thinking that maybe by exposing a lot of their teaching to the masses, it'll actually help
And the few bucks I had to pay to get into the Creation Museum it's a small price to pay for the opportunity to expose what they're doing
And so I think I've changed my mind about this
there are some tastes of home as well
Again, there are a lot of North American imports there as well
I would say yeah, try out some of the French cuisine, especially if you do like seafood
Because from all my seafood-loving friends, they say it's fantastic
Things will always be a little bit more expensive, just because of the currency conversions
So like a meal at McDonalds is about 5-6 euros, which is about 8 dollars Canadian
It ends up being a little more than what we pay here
It's also because tax rate is higher in France, so a lot of things are going to be more expensive
Rent is definitely going to be expensive, especially if you are living off of campus, like I did
Rent definitely was definitely much more than what I paid in Waterloo, so
I know it's not the most optimal situation but we can operate
You can operate a vehicle with three log nuts and that's how I would approach that

I'm going to recap, I can't call dispatch
I'd certainly would try a cellphone then call the dispatcher on the cellphone to let them know
As I said you're on a bridge and that area with no communications are working kind of a black zone too much metal of the bridge, uncommunicatable

Hi guys, um so this is The Book of Mormon Two-Minute Challenge  I'm really excited to be doing this I believe a lot of members are going to be doing this soon, taking part in this challenge so let's see if we can keep this under two minutes because i'm really bad at timing things so The Book of Mormon Two-Minute Challenge basically i just wanna share my testimony with you about The Book of Mormon um, The Book of Mormon is the most wonderful book on the face of the earth, It's the most correct book, and in the words of Joseph Smith it's the keystone of our religion.
Hi I'm Jessica Smith and this is what is a certificate of deposit.
Sequences are fundamental to computing.
A sequence is an ordered set of values.
Here we have the colors of the rainbow in order.
There isn't just one class for sequences or one data abstraction that describes sequences in Python or in programming languages in general.
The sequence abstraction is a collection of behaviors about how sequences can be manipulated.
The two important behaviors that define something as a sequence are that a sequence has a finite length and a sequence has an element, that's another value, corresponding to any non-negative integer index less than its length starting at zero.
Okay, we're still working on that introduction, you've got your attention getter, you're going to come in really strong with that.
Well, you're going to follow that up with credibility.
Now what do I mean by credibility?
Either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be elected President and like you, I have some differences with both, but my job is to be an independent fighter for Iowa
I'm working to cut your taxes and create jobs and in dangerous times, I'm working to keep Iowa families safe
When Congress failed to pass a budget, I had my own pay withheld because no matter who's President, I'm accountable to you

Hello Scotland Peter Toth here from Australia.
we cannot buy our security our freedom from the threat of the bomb by committing an immorality so great as saying to a billion human beings now a enslaved behind the iron curtain "give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skins, we're willing to make a deal with your slave masters." Alexander Hamilton said, "A nation which can  prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master, and deserves one.
Now, let's set the record straight.
There's no argument over the choice  between peace and war,  but there's only one guaranteed way you can have peace and you can have it in the next second surrender.
Admittedly, there's a risk in any course we  follow other than this, but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement, and  this is the specter our well-meaning liberal friends refuse to face that their policy of accommodation is appeasement,  and it gives no choice between peace and war, only between fight or surrender.
If we continue to accommodate, continue to back and retreat, eventually we have to face the final demand the ultimatum.
And what then?
This is my 26th year in education.
I've been in about five or six schools in about five states, and pretty much every educator I have met wants to help kids.
They want to teach.
They want kids to learn.
And the beauty of the community school strategy in a school is that it is the method by which — the strategy by which teachers can teach, and they can accomplish that goal because what they have in front of them, their students, can gain access to the teaching and the learning and all of that research that the entire nation is spending money on figuring out how to teach.
They all of a sudden can gain access to that.
Hi this is Eric Sterns with Expert Village and we are discussing signaling with respect to emergency situations and what we are going to talk about now is the nature of what signaling is.
What you are doing is whether you are using visual signals or audible signals, you are breaking a pattern.
There is an established routine that people tend to have when they are driving or hiking whether it is visual or audible with the car horn or with the radio running and what you are doing whether they are drive or walking is someone who is in the same vicinity as you, you are using their tools to break their pattern to notice something is not right.

Hi there could you state your name?
My name is Jerry Day.
Hi Jerry, okay I was going to ask you some questions here.
So what kind of symptoms were you experiencing before you came in to see Dr. Polzin?
Hi everyone, this is Yasuko and it's time for Massage Monday
I often get questions on my videos like "Will this work for me?" or "How long will it take to see the results?" It's a valid question and I would wonder that too if I watch a tutorial video for something that I want to see the results
Instead of repeating myself over and over again here's my answer - I don't know
I don't know you but even if I knew you, I don't know how long it's going to take to see the results or if something works for you at all because everyone is different
The only way to tell is by actually trying it
I don't even know if something works for me unless I try it
If you happen to see lot of happy comments maybe it will work for you too but you never know unless you try it
Everything you see and hear in this world is someone's opinion anyway
When I share something that I learned from others, I'm sharing someone else's opinions
For things like Acupressure it could be someone's opinion from thousands of years ago
Hopefully what I share or the opinions I share works for you in a way it's presented but if not there's ton of information out there and I hope you find the solution that works best for you
As you try the possible solution, remember to take the ownership of your body and listen to your body
Stop doing things if you feel they're doing disservice to your body
Go to a doctor if certain symptom persists
Only do things that will make your body, mind and spirit happier
And that's my opinion
Hello, my name is Emily Gasner and I'm with Working Solutions, and I'll be talking about how to apply for a minority loan.
Oftentimes there are programs around the country that are specifically geared towards minority business owners that need financing.
And so what you can do is research on the Internet in your particular area, which one of these programs is right for you.

If we if our default is there inside of that space, it's like putting a limiter on our potential
When we're in that space, do you think we are attracting people to us or you think are we may be pushing some people away
Are we making people want to be around us a lot or we may be only attracting other angry people or other stressed out people that we can relate to

There's another range of emotions
Now that doesn't mean you can't bounce into stress, which is just fear
You can't bounce into anger or you know defending somebody or something
Felienne: Hi.
My name is Felienne, and I will help you take your data analysis skills to the max.
So maybe you've thought about improving your data skills.
You hear people talk about big data and open data.
And you're like, I should learn that.
But on the other hand, you think, isn't that for these guys, for the nerds?
Well, I'm here to tell you that programming and data analysis is really for everyone.
- So here is a sure-fire way to get more connection cards filled out by new visitors every single week
Are you ready? Here it is, ask for less information
And I'm serious here because I see so many connection cards that are asking for perhaps half a dozen, even a dozen, different fields of information from new visitors and it's a very simple premise here
The more information you ask for, the less cards you are gonna have returned
It's already difficult enough to fill out a physical card, walk to your connection desk, welcome desk, whatever you call it, hand that to a real person there
They exchange that for a free gift
There are so many moving pieces here
There's a lot of variables, so what we gotta do is remove as much as variables as possible so that we can have more cards filled out by our new visitors so for instance, we do this all the time in digital marketing and this is a comparison between physical interactions and onboarding of individuals versus the digital side, on the digital side of things, when someone comes, cold, has never met us before online, what do we do? We wanna get their information, much like churches, what we're trying to do with new visitors
All we ask for, though, is their email address, right? Because it's a digital interaction and so it's a little bit different
We ask for someone's first name and their email
Sometimes, all we ask for is their email and nothing else and what we'll find is, and we can track this because it's done digitally and on a bigger scale, the more fields that we ask for, if we ask for first, last name, and email, three different fields, we'll notice a drop in responses
Now, if you are gonna be doing this, you also have to recognize that the more fields that you ask for, when those do get filled out by people, those are gonna be higher quality responses, right? Because you're separating some of the people that don't wanna respond, you'll get higher quality responses the more form fields that you ask for but when someone's already visiting you at church, they're a pretty high quality responder already and so, to get more cards filled out, just ask for less information
What would I recommend that you ask for? I recommend that you ask for first name, last name, email address, that's it
Maybe, if you need a fourth thing, you could throw phone number on there
There's basically three big things you could ask for, right? Phone number, email, and actual address, physical address
Don't ask for all three, don't ask for their postal code, their ZIP code, their gender, how many people are in their family, if they want to get connected to a small group, if they wanna get baptized, if they want to dedicate their life to Christ, there's so many things you could ask
Get the information first and then follow up secondarily and get that information on the next interaction
I'm not saying you shouldn't get that information just don't ask for it upfront
FORWARD FESTIVAL &amp; NEXXPO - THE FUTURE'S HAPPENING NOW trt 1:18    The Forward Festival this past week was just outstanding.
The eight days of events highlighted the innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship that are simply exploding in the Greater Madison Region.
The Greater Madison Chamber of Commerce's neXXpo event held in conjunction with the festival was a perfect complement and emphasized the importance of new technology start-ups to the health and vibrancy of the entire business sector.
The week was full of excitement, success stories and potential.
But it also exposed some areas in need of attention.
It was impossible to miss the sense of apprehension over misguided politics like the proposed ban on fetal tissue use, or the terrible risks involved in devaluing the University of Wisconsin.
But these issues too served to focus the vision for the future that is being created along East Washington Avenue, at the UW Research Park, Epic and elsewhere.

Hello, my name is Vic Schumacher with HPE Financial Services.
Today we are going to talk about how do insurance companies make money.
Hi, I'm Molly Stewart with Home Warranty of America and I'd like to talk to you today about Vyral Marketing.
They have been wonderful, helping us with our success stories, our testimonial videos that we've been able to share with our clients, and it's been really great talking to other top-producing team leaders and owner/brokers throughout the country on their Vyral experience.
They have database marketing, video marketing, social media, they handle that as well too, and to hear the success stories from them as well too, it's been really great.
So I highly encourage you to use Vyral Marketing and find out how they can help you grow your business too.

I run a social enterprise in the United States called Rubicon Programs.
In the circus, they are chained down in boxcars for most hours of the day, sometimes for days on end
This cruelty caused me to have second thoughts about all animals, and how we, humans, treat them
It didn't seem right that I was paying attention to certain animal rights' issues and not others, so I eventually started to question the treatment of farm animals who are held and slaughtered for food
I learned that breeding mother pigs are forced to live in cages so small that they can't even turn around for their entire lives
Their piglets are taken away from them within weeks to be fattened up for slaughter, and the mother pigs are forced to go through this process again and again
As for cows, I thought that there could be nothing wrong with dairy, I thought cows just produce milk
It's a natural process, so how could that be cruel
&gt;&gt; The big question that I think needs to be answered is how can we provide entrepreneurial education to the poorest of the poor?
Access to education as we know it is no longer sufficient or valid, only access to education but education that has no quality, does not produce any tangible results.
Many of the world's poor have access to education and, in fact, have been to third, sixth, ninth grade.
That has not changed anything, so what we need is more practical entrepreneurial education to everybody.
She helped me build such a strong foundation in math that as an engineering student today I am so grateful for

My first college class was such an overwhelmingly good experience
It probably could have just as easily been a bad experience, but it was a great one


An experience which made me start to believe in school being possible for me, an experience which made me begin to believe in myself
And it’s an experience which could have easily done the opposite
This was only the beginning though, because this experience was not exclusive
Hey, Rhett and Link here, just hanging out in our magic coffin
We really wish we could be with you there at Vidcon but we're in production on our new series, Rhett and Link's Buddy System
It is a scripted musical comedy which features a lot of totally normal things, the least of which is this magic coffin
And a rollerskating/rollerblading fight, and a barbershop quartet that we sing with clones of ourselves
And possibly a talking exercise bike
Actually, definitely a talking exercise bike because that is also in there
And lots of other stuff
We're super excited to be working with YouTube to bring this to our fans on the platform via YouTube Red
So look for Rhett and Link's Buddy System this year on YouTube Red
In the meantime, we're gonna be hanging out in our secret magic coffin
It's a secret now? Yes
Don't tell anybody about our magic coffin

How are you? Bonjour, comment allez-vous? I speak English



I want to leave
Apparently, fireworks went off and totally freaked Kuma out and he did something that he's never done before which is fu**ing bolt

He ran outside of our yard and Josh and I were driving back from yoga, and I seen my brother walking down the street
Like my brother's a pretty tanned dude, like big dude
Just looks miserable white and like panic-stricken and his girlfriend Kelly was freakin' crying, and we're like, "What is happening


He ran off and we can't find him
Louise was a fairly popular comic book artist at the time, having an incredible run on Golden Age Aquaman
But again, as far as I know there is no evidence to say that Steve Ditko even knew that this character existed, which would make for one incredible coincidence that only the Parker luck could provide
But what ever happened to Shannon Kane, the Spider Queen, you might be wondering
Well interestingly enough, she fell into the public domain
But that is not the end of her story
In 1993 Marvel created a series called Invaders, and with issue number one we saw the Spider Queen
And I want to point out that this Marvel character is technically not the same as the Golden Age character of the Spider Queen, it is a character inspired by the public domain version
Mr. Speaker, this May 14th marked eight years of incarceration for Iran's seven Baha'i leaders.
They have been imprisoned for practising their faith--a fundamental right guaranteed under international and Iranian law.
They are among hundreds of prisoners of conscience held in Iranian jails on the grounds of their religious beliefs, political opinions, and civil activities.
Some potentially risk torture and execution.
When somebody finally decides that they want to run for state wide office whether it's governor, whether it's US Congress, whether it's a US Senate seat.
A major effort and an energy.
That person has made a commitment that they want to do a couple of things.
One, they want to try to raise ideas and if we didn't have people who are willing to step up, we would not have good elections and we wouldn't have the exchange of ideas that occurs.
Unfortunately, we have this whole thing on incumbents.
It's hard to ever beat an incumbent.
Voters vote for somebody that they know.
Hi, I'm Patti German, and I'm a licensed Marriage and Family therapist, here in New York City.
In this clip, we're going to talk about how to become independent.
"Nice!" "Aw." Hi I'm Rokosz, your digital lifestyle expert and we're talking about how to buy Wii games and accessories online.
Well the first thing you have to know is is that when you're buying things online you basically have two choices, well three.
One is to buy em from a reputable source; Amazon, or any of the major big box retailers that also have online activities; a trusted buyer, that's your first.
A second is used, always a little bit more tricky, your major auction sites can do but there's a little bit more risk because you know when you're dealing with basically DVD's or game DVD's a scratch or two you may not see can ruin your whole experience on it.
So again buying from a trusted resaler or refurbisher is the other way.
The third way is to just flat out get ripped off, alright.
Hey there, I'm Lucy and I want to make this video talking about the Discover It credit card, because that's the card I use.
So I'm a college student and they do have a Discover It option for college students.
It's a little bit different than the actual one.
It has an $800 limit, but it's really great.
I couldn't be happier for my first credit card.
There's no late fee on the first late payment.
There's no annual fee.
No over the limit fee.
And you interest rate does not go up due to late fees, just to name a few of the advantages of this compared to other cards.
PATRICIA VISEUR-SELLERS: Hi.
is becoming narcissistically encased in our own mental vortex, our own constant talking, building a world-- it's an imaginary world
Whatever you have, we need it
We need water, we need supplies

Please send those as we are a part of your country
And those supplies have not been sent
Donald Trump has not done it
Rather than sending aid, he is sending insults
Rather than helping American citizens, he is wondering why in the hell they aren't paying their debts
Keep in mind, that's coming from a guy who routinely doesn't pay his debts, and has declared bankruptcy at least five times throughout his life
Nonetheless, the situation on the island is dire
And how do we know that

Now here are the servers.

My name is Monique Burns of Great Day Property Management
We are a Detroit, Michigan property management company that buys the properties ourselves

We place the tenants, and then we sell the properties to investors all over the country and all over the world
Right now they are enjoying their 12%-18% return on investment
In this video, I am going to discuss the services that we offer
One of the first things that we do is we find the location of the house
In Detroit, you can go on Google Earth
You can read statistics
It does not matter
Unless you live here, you don't really know how one street will perform compared to another street
My husband is a Detroit native and he has a really good sense of really good places to buy properties
In Detroit it is like block by block, or street
You go one street over, it can be the end of your investment
Another service that we offer is the renovation
That is another part that my husband does and when he renovates the houses he does it such that we get as few calls as possible
So when our investors are first buying the properties that first year, the repairs are very very minimal
Then we also offer tenant placement
That is where I come in
I have quite the extensive background checking that I do
It even includes visiting where they currently live
Which can be a real eye-opener
Then we also offer one of the best insurance rates of any other Detroit landlord that I have ever talked to
That was through a lot of research and we are really happy with this insurance company so that is something we can help you with when you become an investor, is a really good insurance rate
We also are great about the taxes because we have our contacts in Detroit that help us make sure that we have the best amount of taxes due that they are fair and reasonable
Another thing that we are able to do is guide you through a 1031 exchange
We have experience with that

We know the timing of it all, so we are happy to work with you through that
We can also help you start your own LLC if you don't want to own the house in your own name

Hi my name is Jessica, and you can't really tell now, but awhile ago I really struggled with losing weight.
I tried so many different diet plans that all turned out to be bogus, I was so frustrated that I was still overweight!
My weight problem was starting to really effective my life.
I was very self conscious about my body, especially around men, and my self esteem really plummeted.
Then I ended up seeing Dr. Oz talk about how raspberry ketones are supposed to help you lose weight, and I wasn't really sure if it would really work.
But then I had a friend of mine tell me how a product called Raspberry Ketones Max actually helped her to lose weight, so I decided that I wanted to give it a shot.
Now I have to say, that I am SO glad I found out about it!
that the environmental challenge is the great challenge of our age
Every generation faces its own unique set of challenges
In the past, we've had folks who've worked to bring about greater civil rights for certain parts of the human population
We've had folks who've worked to transition us to new technological forms through the Industrial Revolution
We've had folks who've been in generations that have had to fight great wars against fascism and so forth
This particular moment is really, I think, about making sure that human activities are ultimately compatible with ecological realities
If we don't sort this out, nothing else matters
There's a quote from a guy I know named David Oren
David and I taught a workshop together some years ago
And during that workshop, David said something that has stuck with me and resonated ever since
first global more than ever because more than ever the world is becoming a fragile environment in which billions and billions of people are more and more dependent on the great advantages and opportunities of technology, the Internet, water, food, the environment, all of which in order to sustain it and make it more available to millions of people is going to require more and more innovation in every aspect of engineering that we now do

ONE OTHER COMMENT I WANT TO MAKE, IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT A LOT OF MILLENNIAL'S, YOUNG VOTERS, ARE DISILLUSIONED BY THE ELECTION PROCESS
A LOT OF THEM WILL HAVE CONSPIRATORIAL ANSWERS WHEN YOU ASK THEM WHY THEY ARE NOT POLITICALLY ACTIVE
THEY FEEL LIKE THE ELECTIONS ARE RIGGED, MY VOTE DOESN'T REALLY MATTER, I CAN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE
THE REASON WHY IS NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE AGAINST ESTABLISHMENT, THEY ARE AGAINST THE PROPAGANDA MACHINE THAT EXISTS
IT'S DIFFICULT TO FIGHT AGAINST THAT
HI, I'M NANCY-ANN DEPARLE, DIRECTOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF HEALTH REFORM AND I'M HERE FOR MY WEEKLY UPDATE ON WHAT WE'RE DOING ON HEALTH CARE REFORM AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
CONGRESS IS WORKING HARD ON PROPOSALS FOR HEALTH REFORM THIS WEEK THAT WILL CUT COSTS AND ASSURE QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS.
HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE, WE ARE CONTINUING TO MEET WITH AMERICANS WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE HIGH COST OF CARE.
LAST WEEK WE MET WITH SEVERAL SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO TOLD US THAT THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE IS PREVENTING THEM FROM HIRING MORE WORKERS.
IN FACT, ONE BUSINESS FROM NASHVILLE TOLD US THAT THEY HAD TO LAY OFF 15 WORKERS OF THEIR 55-MEMBER WORK FORCE.
SEVERAL BUSINESS OWNERS SAID THEY ARE CUTTING BACK BENEFITS, AND ASKING EMPLOYEES TO PAY MORE OUT OF POCKET.
NEXT WE WILL BE MEETING WITH FARMERS, RANCHERS AND FISHERMEN -- THE PEOPLE WHO PRODUCE FOOD IN THIS COUNTRY.
MANY OF THEM ALSO SAY IT IS HARD TO FIND AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE OUT IN THE HEARTLAND, AND THAT THE COST OF THEIR CARE CONTINUES TO RISE.

Taking tests and writing papers and while theory is important my co-founders and I are believe is the best way to learn entrepreneurship is like doing it the practice of it
The idea was three-day startup is that the best way to learn how to start a company is by starting the company
We get students together over a weekend for three very intense days of starting a company
I think I was really surprised about some of the skill sets but a lot of Davidson students could bring to the table on such a short notice
And the fact that we were able to produce a functional prototype in three hours that would actually be downloaded onto a phone and actually do what it was supposed to on such a very short-term basis, I thought that was really amazing and showed me the potential of Davidson to create something on a short-term basis
what we could do if you actually devote large amounts of time to it
I wanted to learn more and I wanted to grow my understanding of what it meant to be in business and what it meant so start your own business
So I saw this there's an awesome opportunity when we went out and we talk to customers about if they would like our products and it was an intense instigator like process that I thought was an incredible opportunity and something that I'm so fortunate Davison allowed for it to come to campus
Initiatives like this provides students a space to reimagine the possibilities of where the liberal arts can take them
It provides space for exploration of possible career pursuits, of places where your passions can plug into what you've learned during college
It's a singular opportunity to just find where your leadership strength emerge and to really realize your identity in a new way and to get a full experience that Davidson offers
The rate of change in the world is increasing, right
This is happening through technology and a number of other factors, but innovation and entrepreneurship moves incredibly quickly
By having these programs here is equipping the students to have really great careers and really great lives
Everyone should take the opportunity to get involved some entrepreneurship programs if you never know what lessons you can learn from them
Why is abortion so important to you people?
What is it about that procedure that's so important to you?
First of all, we're not "you people," so I'd like to first address that.
"You people" is not appropriate, I don't believe, for this forum.
This is financial advisor Patrick Munro discussing what is a notary bond.
Greetings and welcome to the Chapter Guide for the Class Presentations of Chemistry 222. In Chemistry the topic for Class Presentations will be compounds, and your first goal is to reserve a compound with me, the instructor that you want to present on.
I want everybody to present on a different compound,  that's why I'm making you go through a "reservation system". Possible compounds would be things like ethanol, acetone, sodium chloride, I'll even accept things like DNA and various other related species.
If you don't know what to pick, please talk to me and we'll figure out something that sounds interesting to you.
Once you have a compound reserved, you should start working on a paper and a presentation that you'll give towards the end of the term.
The paper itself will be about five pages long and you'll need a title page and a separate list of  references, and all of this information can be found in the Class Presentations Frequently Asked Questions or FAQ which can be found in your syllabus.
The presentation itself should be no more than five minutes.

My name is Phillip Beningoso I'm an investment professional and I'm going to be discussing how to calculate return on a stockholder's equity.
Now return on equity or stockholder's equity, R.O.E.
is one of the most important financial measures to consider when evaluating a business for possible investment.
That tells you how much profit the company is making with the money invested by stockholders.
Let me give you a couple of steps here for calculating and understanding R.O.E.
Hi I'm Jonathan Ayres with Network For Success and today we're going to talk about what is high level language?
Well gosh another technical term that is very complex and the average person could probably not ever have anything to do with high level language because this is talking about programming of computers and programming of computers is very complex but let's just talk real quick about what high level language is.
The first therapy dog on record was Smokey a four pound Yorkshire Terrier who was found in a foxhole in New Guinea.
She flew in 12 combat missions then worked with wounded soldiers at the 233rd combat hospital.
Hi, I'm Mike Campbell at Doggy Styles in Beverley Hills and I'm here to talk a little bit about increasing retail sales.
I think that it is important first to note that different industries, different fields are going to use different methods to increase their sales.
For instance, this is a pet store, we don't have a lot of competition close by so its very easy for me to standout.
I don't need to do as much advertising and promotion to let people know that I'm here.
Once they're aware of this store, they remember us and they don't confuse us with other stores.
On the other hand, I have a little woman's clothing store that just opened up next store.
Its going to be much more important for them to do a heavy amount of advertising and promotion and marketing trying to get their name out there, trying to get people to recognize them and know them from the clutter, from all of the other woman's clothing stores.
And there are probably 30 woman's clothing stores in the three block radius of my store.
So for me, its much easier to get that awareness.
The awareness is really key to increasing the sales.
Its not just the amount of money people are spending when they come in, its getting more people to come in and spend that money.
In terms of I had 13 out of 16 of my students get a D or below in sentence structure
It was the same thing
Once we’ve analysed that data we identify stage targets and this is what drives our whereto next
So once we’ve got that whereto next we know what we need to go back and explicitly teach in the classroom
We also meet again for another data day where we bring all those samples back
We have that consistent teacher judgment just to make sure still we’re on that same page: What’s your As, Bs, Cs
And those target students that we identify that we were going to track for growth we check in to see if they’ve made that growth


My name is Maurice Williams I'm the owner of move well fitness a personal training in Lifestyle Fitness studio in Washington DC and I am so fortunate to Have the opportunity to have Stacy Wischer's Fitness Fix Monthly Newsletters Prior to working with her and having her newsletters that are just very simple to just put into my infusionsoft account and rearrange a few things and in Ten minutes or less I can have them sent out
Prior to that I was spending easily two to three hours finding information to put it in into the prior Newsletter format that I add and It was very tedious
I did not look forward to the days when I had to do it, but now that I have her program It's so simple for me to do that in addition to the newsletters, We also get weekly social Media or Daily social media things that we can post to our various social media accounts
Whether it's Twitter or Facebook ETC and same thing I had to kind of search and dig deep for information but now I have all that so it's Simple fix for me
Hi I'm Chris Morales, I been in practice of criminal defense for over 20 years now.
I always get a lot of questions about sentencing.
So I want to go over the basics of sentencing with you today.
There are three types of crimes there is infractions there are misdemeanors and there are felonies.
For infractions the most that happen to you is a find and you cannot go to jail if you are convicted of an infraction.
For misdemeanors the most time you can do in jail is one year.
That's the maximum for a misdemeanor.
Hi there, I'm Tracy Goodwin, and I'm the red sweater lady.
out to create something that would perhaps encourage someone to follow Hannah's path
But I have seen a lot of articles that mention this psychological effect where after you're exposed to suicide, suicides go up
So because of that effect, if people who are already in a bad place watch this show, the show could lead them to even worse places and that's not what anybody wants
But I don't know if that means that shows shouldn't have any graphic, dark scenes at all
If those things are always censored, then I wonder how impactful of a discussion could be started
So speaking of discussion, I feel like that's where "13 Reasons Why" deserves quite a bit of credit
I think "13 Reasons Why" has reached a very large audience and because of that, it's stimulated a pretty big discussion
Hello this is Bobby Cox, Commissioner of the Indiana High School Athletic Association, here to provide for you today a summary of the January Executive Committee Meeting
Today with the committee entertain three proposals from the Indiana Association of Track and Cross Country Coaches with respect to changes in sports of track and cross-country
The first proposal set forth by the Association was to allow a student athlete to be entered into for event excluding relays in the IHSAA tournament series
The committee after a long discussion decided to table that proposal and they will come back and seek more information from the Track and Cross Country Coaches Association to make a decision about that proposal
The second proposal was a proposal to increase the number of semi-state in the sport cross-country from 4 semi-states to 5 and alter other levels of the tournament
That proposal was failed 0 to 19
And finally the third proposal set forth by the track and cross country Coaches was the opportunity to substitute a pre-designated alternate in the event of a student-athlete being injured during the meet and that student being able to fill the lane or fill the position during the meet
That proposal past 19 to 0
The Committee also heard today to financial reports for the fall sports and the football financial report
I'm pleased to report to the membership and to the public that the football tournament revenues increased from 2015-16 and the fall finance report also reflected an increase from previous years

This question comes from Cory on Mint's Facebook page.
And this is Cory's question.
What is the best way to pay off $32,000 of student loan debt?
Cory that's a very good question.
It really depends on the interest rate that you're paying on that student loan debt.
There are certain types of student loans that have very, very good interest rates-- 2 1/2%, 3 1/2% and in many cases, that interest is tax deductible.
The President: Everywhere I go across America and around the world, I hear from people -- especially young people -- who are ready to start something of their own, to lift up people's lives and shape their own destinies.
That's entrepreneurship -- that spark of prosperity that creates new jobs and new businesses, new ways to deliver basic services, and new ways of seeing the world.
That's why, since 2010, the Global Entrepreneurship Summit has brought together the best innovators, thinkers, social entrepreneurs, and investors to a different region of the world -- from the United States to Sub-Saharan Africa.
And I've seen firsthand what a difference it can make for entrepreneurs, especially for women and people from marginalized communities, to connect with each other and get feedback on their ideas, to build the networks that can help turn their dream for a business or program or app, into reality.
This week, innovators around the world are marking Global Entrepreneurship Week.
I'm calling on the private sector, foundations, investors, and universities to help us increase opportunities for all entrepreneurs, no matter who they are, where they're from, or what they look like.
And I'm pleased to announce that next year, the United States will once again host the Global Entrepreneurship Summit.
It was one of my first cases.

The North Atlantic Council has just discussed the situation in Syria and in particular the horrific use of chemical weapons around Damascus on the 21 of August.
We condemn in the strongest possible terms these outrageous attacks, which caused major loss of life.
NATO Allies expressed their full support to the ongoing UN investigation.
They deplored that the Syrian regime failed to provide immediate and secure access for the United Nations inspectors to the sites of the attacks.
The Syrian regime maintains custody of stockpiles of chemical weapons.
Information available from a wide variety of sources points to the Syrian regime as responsible for the use of chemical weapons in these attacks.
This is a clear breach of long-standing international norms and practice.

It happens to all of us but did your recruiter see that photo? We turn to the smarties at the American Genius and Jobvite to find out
In a word, yes
Whatever you're willing to put out there on social media is accessible by anyone at any time
It is difficult for an employer or a recruiter to resist looking at an applicant's social media feed, practically making it a part of the process
A whopping ninety-two percent of recruiters look through a social media feeds of the applicant that's applying for jobs that are open
The infographic from the 2015 Recruiter Nation study found that what they look for can be broken down into nine categories their feelings towards each category was represented in percentages of either positive negative or neutral
The top negative feelings that recruiters had towards social profiles were spelling or grammatical errors in posts or tweets and reference to marijuana use
So, in summary what are three quick things that you can do now to make yourself look better towards employers? Make sure your autocorrect is on for both iphone and android phones the link is in the show notes for how to do this
On a computer i swear by Grammarly
It check your spelling and grammar is a plug-in for your browser, it's easy
Untag yourself from any photos that have any semblance of a day, pipe, bowl


you don't want to be getting into that conversation being like, "it wasn't mine" with a potential employer


yuck! While you're at it would be safe to remove anything that sexually-explicit or related to alcohol consumption
Fifty-four percent of recruiters felt negatively towards it
Lastly, you can just update your privacy settings so that it's only showcasing what you're doing to close friends or family
emphasis on health inequities
Public health has been concerned for a long time, particularly in Toronto, with what makes people healthy or unhealthy and what we now call the "social determinants of health" have been a preoccupation public health and Medical Officers of Health for a long time
My predecessor a century ago Charles Hastings, who we talk about sometimes in this organization, campaigned for the improvement of income levels and better housing for people because he recognized that those were key factors determining whether people were healthy or not
Ernst &amp; Young's Customer Experience Series, has found the cost of electricity was one of the most significant ongoing expenses for consumers after rent or mortgage payments, with 92% of customers reporting that electricity bills accounted for a moderate to high amount of their total household running costs.
However, while the increasing size of electricity bills is weighing heavily on the minds of most Australians, perceived barriers such as time, effort and a lack of clear information is preventing them from switching service providers to seek a better deal.
Good morning, I'm Ryan Misner, Assistant Director, Examination here at NCARB
Today is Thursday, April 13 and I just wanted to check in with you quickly and give you an update on where we are related to score report releases
If you've had a chance to log into your NCARB record this morning, you may have already seen that our score reports have been released for Programming &amp; Analysis

That means we have two more score reports to get out and those are in process already
Project Management and Construction &amp; Evaluation we're hoping to get out the very beginning of May- ideally that first week but we'll be in touch about a specific date on when you can expect those score reports to be released
For those of you that passed, congratulations! For those of you that didn't, that's okay too especially if you were one of our early testers and took advantage of those early tester incentives
Look for that free seat credit to be applied to your NCARB record by the beginning of next week or so
Whether this was your first test, your last test, or somewhere in between, there are a lot of resources available for you as you begin to study or study for a retest


What happens if I am hit by a person who does not have insurance or who does not have enough insurance to cover my damages?
First off, California requires that every driver carry a minimum liability policy.
The minimum policy is what's known as a 1530 policy.
But the reality of the situation is since there's so many people in California, a lot of people don't have insurance, or a lot of people don't pay their insurance on time.
So you cannot rely on that person to cover for your damages.
If you are hit by a person who has no insurance, you may have the option to sue them.
You may get a judgment against them, but getting a judgment does not mean you're going to get paid.
You have to collect on this judgment.
The chances are people that have no insurance are not going to have the assets necessary to pay out this judgment.
Secondly, collecting on a judgment is not a fun process.
The value of digital marketing in today’s marketing venues is that you’re able to reach people that you haven’t been able to reach before.
I can’t make you watch television when my commercial airs.
Hopefully I can get something to you in the mail.
But when something, somebody is actually going out there and doing some research or looking at something else, you have the opportunity to reach them in many ways through banner advertising, through enthusiast sites, to your own site.
So it really gives you the opportunity to reach people in more areas.
Some of the great successful stories that we’ve had in the campaigns that we have used is really talking about student successes and their outcomes.
John Holdren: Hello everyone.
I'm John Holdren, President Obama's science and technology advisor.
I wish I could be with you today for this celebration and personally congratulate you on the official opening of this extraordinary new facility.
But while official duties are keeping me in Washington, I do want to give a big shout-out to NASA and to architect Bill McDonough and his team.
You can all take great pride in this extremely green building, which I understand is designed to be the highest performing and most energy efficient building in the federal government.
President Obama has noted that...quote...upgrading the energy efficiency of America's buildings is one of the fastest, easiest and cheapest ways to save money, cut down on harmful pollution and create good jobs right now...end of quote.
And I know I'm speaking for him, as well as myself, when I say that it's great to see NASA taking that advice to heart, applying some of its most advanced technologies, right here on Earth, to create a building that achieves a platinum rating for environmentally sustainable construction.
Sustainability Base at Ames will generate more electricity that it uses over the course of a year.
It will use 90-percent less potable water than conventionally built buildings of equivalent size.
Its maintenance costs will also drop, though the use of some of NASA's most advanced intelligent control technologies, originally developed for our nation's human and robotic space exploration missions.
In short, this new building represents a better way of doing business for NASA, the federal government and the American people.

But the one that looms largest is Russia

Hi, I’m Stephanie Ciccarelli, co-founder of Voices.com.
In this video, you’ll learn how to upload and feature your demos at Voices.com.
You’ll also discover how to best promote them to clients.
Since audio is not something you can technically "preview" before listening, descriptions and keywords are very important.
You need words to attract prospective customers, build trust and identify what it is that the listener will hear before they choose to click play.
Your demo may be what determines whether or not you book the job but it's TEXT that attracts people to your demo and encourages them to listen.
Remember, the Internet is a visual medium.
The Internet is also text driven.
Since audio cannot be "previewed" or heard before actually listening to it, text is required to set the tone for what someone is going to hear before they hear it.

On the cosmic scale, transmission delays can be a real kick to the cosmic pants
Take the Curiosity rover for example
It landed on Mars and it took 14 minutes for a transmission from the rover to get to Earth
14 minutes, that's half an episode of Jeopardy before you find out if the rover landed safely or if Jawas had sold it for scrap parts
So is there a way to communicate faster than the speed of light

One of the checks we just established is we need to make sure that the packets we sent to the device come out and look exactly the same.
So we need to compare two packets and all their fields.
Now we could write a method to achieve that ,however there are some shortcomings with this.
The first one is, not all the fields which we, which we have in the packet are actually sent to the device.
For example, packet kind is only used to guide all generations.

RADHIKA COOMARASWAMY: I think the purpose here is to try-- so far, a lot of the discussion on sexual violence has been in the Security Council of the United Nations at the moment, the last two years.
I think the idea is to try and get the Human Rights Council to also make this a high profile issue.
To get as many delegations on board with regard to this.
So I think the purpose of today's session was to try and really bring the profile of the issue to the council here, and to emphasize the need for a human rights framework with regard to this issue.
And to focus on the survivor, the victim, and her needs and her rights.
I have a special [INAUDIBLE] on violence against women.
In today’s world people are just so overwhelmed by information that you really have to set yourself apart.
And I think that the digital tools such as YouTube and internet based information, we use TV infomercial mediums to educate our consumers about the Car MD product and technology.

Among India's growing middle class, there's a dawning of philanthropy, he says
Many people are attaining wealth at a much earlier age
CHANCHALAPATHI DASA: My parents probably would have a house -- we come from a middle-class family -- would have a house when they were probably 50 years of age

We're wrapping up our campaign stop in Winnipeg today speaking with elected officials and regular Manitobans about CDN oil &amp; gas, jobs, &amp; the economy
Manitobans are excited by the opportunity for growth and development and are looking for ways to attract investment into the province
Given the growing global demand for oil and gas, there are opportunities for all Canadian jurisdictions to benefit from our natural resources
Whether it's helping meet power generation needs by using clean Canadian natural gas, or looking at ways to attract investment in building the infrastructure to bring our oil &amp; gas resources to the rest of the world, Manitoba is up to the challenge
We encourage Manitoba to support the building of Energy East, and look for ways to bring more oil and gas jobs into the province
Canada's oil ndustry benefits the entire country and there are many ways we can help it grow and increase those benefits for Manitobans and all Canadians
From consuming our own responsibly produced resources, to being a part of the network that helps bring these same products to the rest of the world
Thanks to our hosts in Winnipeg &amp; we look forward to spending more time in Manitoba

It's been in existence for about 30 years and traditionally it's focused on steroids and small peptide Ramon analyses
I'll be heading up the lipidomics core
We're gonna be looking the lipids in red blood cells and bone marrow aspirates
Lipidomics is where we take a substance of any kind, you can look at plant material, you could look at human material, you could look at just in our case, with this malaria project we'll look at the red blood cells and bone marrow aspirates and try to evaluate all the different kinds lipids that are there, and lipids are just fats
So anything that is basically not water-soluble, you would have seen this in cooking at home and we're going to look to see if we can evaluate all the different kinds in a qualitative sense where we don't try to give you a number of how much is there back out, but just what types lipids are present and we're also going to do some more rigorous quantitating
Where we evaluate how much of individual molecule types are present in response to the malaria infection
Well it's its really a great opportunity

The point is, you know, even as a young person, you can hurt yourself, and you don't know it now.
And we'd be bad parents if we didn't offer a solution to it, and the solution is just moderation.

Circumplex model The circumplex model of emotion was first developed by James Russell
This model suggests that emotions are distributed in a two-dimensional circular space, containing arousal and valence dimensions
Arousal represents the vertical axis and valence represents the horizontal axis, while the center of the circle represents a neutral valence and a medium level of arousal
In this model, emotional states can be represented at any level of valence and arousal, or at a neutral level of one or both of these factors
Circumplex models have been used most commonly to test stimuli of emotion words, emotional facial expressions, and affective states
Russell and Lisa Feldman Barrett describe their modified circumplex model as representative of core affect, or the most elementary feelings that are not necessarily directed toward anything
Hi, I'm Tom Choisnet, enrolled agent and this comes up all the time, people like to complain, "Why am I paying tax on my state income tax refund?" Well that's an honest lament.
But what the truth is is that you can deduct everything that's held out of your check and (any) anything you paid during the taxable year, that's deductible too.
NOW, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT BRANDON MARSHALL IN PARTICULAR
HE IS ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO JOIN THE PROTEST, AND AT THE TIME COLIN KAEPERNICK WAS ALONE, AND BRANDON MARSHALL TO LEE ñ TO GET ME AND SAID, I'LL JOIN YOU
HE'S FROM THE DENVER BRONCOS, ANOTHER TEAM
BRANDON MARSHALL IS A SUCCESSFUL PLAYER BUT NOT AS WELL-KNOWN AS COLIN KAEPERNICK, OR SOME OF THE MORE WELL-KNOWN STARS ON OFFENSE
HE'S A DEFENSIVE PLAYER
Professions, then, are achieved statuses
So is being a student, or a parent
Beyond this difference, there’s also the fact that some statuses are more important than others
A master status is the status others are most likely to use to identify you
This can be achieved, like “professor,” or ascribed, like “cancer patient
” And as that example shows you, a master status doesn’t need to be positive or desirable
In fact, it doesn’t even need to be important to the person who holds it
It just needs to be important to other people, who use the status as their primary way of locating that person in the social hierarchy
Also, statuses tend to clump together in certain ways
Most CEOs are college educated, for example, but they aren’t always
And a mismatch or contradiction between statuses is called a status inconsistency
When we talk about PhD students working as baristas, we’re really bringing it up in that way, because there's a status inconsistency between PhD and barista
My name is Janelle and I’m from the United States.
I speak English and Spanish.
Like the rest of the Language in Motion Team, I’m a language lover and I am also passionate about traveling and learning about other cultures.
During this video, I will explain and demonstrate a couple of ways that English speakers use body language and gestures to communicate.
You may find that there are similarities between non-verbal communication in English and in your native language.
Or, you may find that there clear are cultural differences.
Gestures The use of gestures can sometimes substitute spoken words.
For example, a wave says hello or goodbye.
Rubbing your hands together suggests that you are excited or anxious for what is coming next.
To signal that someone is to stop making noise, hold an index finger against your lips.
Gestures can be used together with words to emphasize a point.
Using a gesture with a conflicting verbal message results in confusion.
Body language Posture effects how a person perceives the speaker even before the speaker starts talking.
Sitting with proper posture, a straight back, arms at your sides, hands folded or relaxed and not on your face, are important in professional settings such as during a presentation or an interview.
Relaxed posture is acceptable with close friends but may not always be acceptable with family.
Hi there, this is Jonathan Ginsberg.
I'd like to offer you some tips about how to improve your chances of winning your Social Security disability case.
One thing you should definitely do is prepare for questions that you know you are going to get.
This is really something that your lawyer should work with you on prior to your hearing.
I do it with my clients usually a week or two, even three weeks before the hearing; we actually practice the questions.
Usually, I spend more time on the pre-hearing in that meeting than the actual hearing lasts but I want my client to be prepared and there are certain things that you are always going to be asked.
For example, if it's a physical case, where there's a physical problem, you are always going to be asked, "How long can you sit at one time?
How much total sitting can you do?
What kind of breaks do you take?
After you've sat for 15 minutes and you need to get up, how long do you have to move around for?" And again, how much total sitting can you do during the day?
You'll be asked the same thing about standing; How much standing can you do?
How much walking can you do?
How much lifting?
Don't say "Not very much"; you want to say five pounds, I can lift maybe five pounds, a gallon of milk, which is eight pounds, by the way, is too heavy.
They want to know how much you can lift frequently; how much you can lift occasionally.
Problems with activities of daily living; getting dressed, bathing, preparing meals, taking care of personal needs.
Those questions are always going to come up.
Natural eye contact in conversation, and in presentations for that matter, is about four seconds.
It's about a complete thought.
Measure it when you're having conversations with friends.
So employers are concerned that you don't really have a proven track record of responsibility and you don't have any references
So what your best bet is to pull from your life experiences that prove you are responsible and professional
Things like volunteer work, school activities, sports, odd jobs are all great examples to mention
"I'm a very motivated worker and fast learner
During my time volunteering at the local thrift store I learned how much I like customer service and the retail world in general

This is financial planner Patrick Munro checking in with you today about how does an annuity work?
An annuity is, got several phases to it.

The triangle, three points, so we have Africa as a source for slaves, the labor force
we have the New World, where the commodities are produced, sugar

First, on behalf of the people of Israel, I wish to send condolences to President Obama, the American people and the family of Kayla Mueller We stand with you.
Israel’s survival is not a partisan issue, not in Israel nor in the United States.
This doesn’t mean that from time to time Israeli governments have not had serious disagreements  with American administrations over the best way to achieve the security of Israel.
Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, declared Israel’s independence in the face of strong opposition from US Secretary of State George Marshall.
Likewise, Prime Minister Eshkol’s decisions at the start of the Six Day War, Prime Minister Begin’s decision regarding the nuclear reactor in Iraq, and Prime Minister Sharon’s decisions to press ahead with Operation Defensive Shield; These were all strongly opposed at the time by American administrations.
Disagreements over Israel’s security have occurred between prime ministers in Israel from the left and from the right and American presidents from both parties.
None of these disagreements led to a rupture in the relationship between Israel and the United States.
In fact, over time, our relationship grew stronger.
But we do have today a profound disagreement with the United States administration and the rest of the P5+1 over the offer that has been made to Iran.
This offer would enable Iran to threaten Israel's survival.
This is a regime, Iran, that is openly committed to Israel’s destruction.
It would be able, under this deal, to break out to a nuclear weapon in a short time, And within a few years, to have the industrial capability to produce many nuclear bombs for the goal of our destruction.
This is not a personal disagreement between President Obama and me.
This is financial adviser Patrick Munro talking about top annuity producers.
I happen to be a top annuity producer and I would like to share with you how I got to that level of production.
It's a situation where you have to work with a compliant insurance company or companies as a broker.

One of the common issues that I'm asked to assist with is the fear that agency owners are only outsourcing so they can sack their local staff
I have to be honest, I thought the same thing years ago when I was working for a property management company and they had employed an overseas VA and it was my job to upskill them
I thought they'd be upskilled and I'd be sacked
In reality, outsourced staff can't do inspections
They can't build face-to-face relationships with your clients and they can not be licensed
These are all tasks, if done well, they'll make your agency stand out from the crowd and can support you in your local admin tasks
We have a bunch of case studies with clients where we explore their fears prior to outsourcing and the reality after working with us
SECRETARY KERRY: Just last week, the U.S.
Fifth Fleet, based here in Bahrain, interdicted an arms shipment that originated in Iran with arms that were clearly moving in the direction of Yemen.
We will continue to push back against this kind of provocation in the region.
Now I want to talk about old material and new material.
And again, I'm going to bring the audience into it.
China has a very tremendous opportunity to help the world to get out of the economic crisis.
Well, number one, it's my brother's company
Number two, I haven't had any active role in over 20 years
Um, number three, that the actual result is that my brother's company actually increased jobs in Indiana
Um, there are more jobs in Indiana now than before
And then finally, the reason they're doing this is because they've been missing in action on all of these efforts to try and keep jobs in the United States
I would ask them to work together with me on the "End Outsourcing Act
" I would ask them to work together with me to meet with the Carrier and Rexnord workers to try to keep jobs here
As a utility brand, we’re still new in the social media space.
One-- a lot of the work that we’re really focused on today is building up the content and the information that consumers need to make a smart, informed decision.
So we use some of that information ahead of the sale and then we use a lot of that information behind the sale.
Hi, this is Rocco Beatrice, Managing Director for Estate Street Partners and the subject is divorce asset protection, how to protect the assets in divorce
Well quite frankly it may be too late
The problem is in divorce is that assets usually owned by both spouses are subject to a fair and equitable distribution
But having said that, the use of an irrevocable trust even while divorce is being contemplated could be of help but if you are going to try to protect assets in divorce it really has to start with your parents
If you're going to inherit - let's say your parents are rich and you're going to inherit a ton of money you've got to talk to your parents about asset protection
You don't want that inheritance to become a marital asset
That in divorce is the subject matter
What are marital assets? Marital assets are those assets that were acquired during the marriage, in some cases before the marriage
The way to try to avoid that is third party, irrevocable trust, assets are not subject to equitable distribution in a divorce situation between divorcing parties
A third party is an irrevocable trust with an independent trustee - that is a third party asset not subject to equitable distribution between the parties
Now equitable distribution - it's not 50-50
When you go in front of a judge the judge is going to consider how long was the marriage, what assets were acquired during the marriage, and it's going to be whatever the court seems to want to take in consideration
They deem it to be appropriate
One such example would be "Who owns the dog? Who's going to get the dog? The Cat?" You can see how


And they're in a marriage, what was the acquired living style that they're going to need? If you have an irrevocable trust, a third party, it's not a marital asset
Even in states like California which is a community state and in a number of other states - Nevada, they are community states
PETER GREENBERGER: Success breeds imitators.
Well, I think the PhD program is really neat because you're not only influencing, once you become a professor, not only influencing MBA's that come through your classes.
&gt;&gt; There's often been a dichotomy set up or proposed that really pits morals against researchers in saying that in proposing that human embryonic stem cell creation is tantamount to murder as it involves the destruction of the blastocyst.
I have issue with that interpretation.
I think that that blastocyst should be valued.
Raviv Druker: Why are you refusing to participate in an election debate  Netanyahu: Nu, I am debating you here Druker: I think you know the difference.
from 1996 There's never been a debate, why are you refusing to debate?
I think the public can judge us regardless Debates are very nice and pleasant for the Media.
In a new analysis, Ernst &amp; Young LLP finds that company-investor engagement has seen a significant component of some new governance trends.
They are: the impact of say-on-pay goes beyond compensation; shareholder proposal topics shift and agreements for withdrawals are reached; board accountability measures continue to strengthen; and, director opposition votes show change in investors' voting practices.
Companies are using such engagement to respond to investor concerns, secure support for proposals put to shareholder vote and mitigate potential exposure to investor campaigns.
It doesn't always occur, but it will
The way to get along with people is to let them be what they are, unless they say "I don't seem to get along with polocks

" Very few people do that

In fact I've never run into a person that said "What do you think of my value system
What do you think of the way I think
" If they do that and it's sincere, not an ego thing where they appear to be polite
If a person annoys you in some way just say "I don't like to discuss races
As you all know, I hope in a few days to celebrate my 75th birthday.
I am grateful that I have the ability to wait until that day in good health.
At the end of this year we will remember that our country, two hundred years ago became a kingdom, with which in our history, a new era dawned.
The coincidence of these two special events has been the motivation for me to decide to abdicate this year.
It seems a good time to take this step, which I have considered for several years.
I have always regarded it as an exceptional privilege to serve our country for a large part of my life and, conform my my duties, to be the queen.
With these duties, Prince Claus was of great support to me.
To this day, this beautiful task given me great satisfaction.
It is inspiring to to feel involved with humans, to live with grief and to share in times of joy and national pride.
I have also been able to experience in the Caribbean parts of our kingdom, where I always much warmth and cordiality have encountered.

As I was saying, for one, the consistency of the jump scares elicits a strong reaction, which makes for an entertaining viewer experience without fail
To quote the game's creator, Scott Cawthon, it's a simple pleasure in life when you can launch someone out of a chair, and it's all captured on YouTube
And because the game is mechanically simple, where all you do is flip between cameras and close some doors, there's very low player agency in the game
The act of playing and the act-- [CLICKING] And the act of watching, are nearly the same thing
It's like how you don't have to drive the jeep through the jungle safari to see all the zoo animals
So, we've looked at 2 search algorithms.
One, breadth-first search, in which we always expand first the shallowest paths, the shortest paths.
Second, cheapest-first search, in which we always expand first the path with the lowest total cost.
And I'm going to take this opportunity to introduce a third algorithm, depth-first search, which is in a way the opposite of breadth-first search.
In depth-first search, we always expand first the longest path, the path with the most lengths in it.
Now, what I want to ask you to do is for each of these nodes in each of the trees, tell us in what order they're expanded, first, second, third, fourth, fifth and so on by putting a number into the box.
And if there are ties, put that number in and resolve the ties in left to right order.
Then I want you to ask one more question or answer one more question which is are these searches optimal?
That is, are they guaranteed to find the best solution?
And for breadth-first search, optimal would mean finding the shortest path.
- I'm assembly member Marco Crespo from the Bronx, and I'h here to advocate for 18 million dollars in this year's budget for the Healthy Foods, Healthy Communities Program.
This is a smart investment to address obesity in our communities.
To address lack of access to quality and healthy foods.
This is a win win from businesses, for farmers.
Good day.
I'm Dr. Charles Grimes, and I'm speaking today on behalf of Expert Village about finding a theatrical monologue for use in auditions.
I'd like to tell you a little bit about knowing the reality of the audition process.
You'll be working artistically to get your monologue together, and that's all wonderful, but you'll be going into a business environment and a business situation.
If you've been an actor long enough, people have told you it's show business, it's not show art.
It's a depressing but very true cliche.
but you can't be a passive participant
That's why it's important to remember Takeaway number two: get into the conversation
You know the importance of word of mouth in growing your business
That's a concept they teach in traditional marketing and it's no different here
With social media, word of mouth has gone global and it's critical that you start bringing yourself into the conversation
Conversations are already happening out there among your target customers and potential partners and if you want them to take notice of you you have to put yourself in the game and get into the conversation
Takeaway number three: the law of fabulous
If you love what you are doing and you do it as who you really are without regard to what people might think, people you are meant to work with are going to be attracted to you
JASON KATCHER: Similarly to what is now allowing educators to take more risk is the fact that the internet has become a very transparent medium.
Again, very different from other mediums that they've traditionally used, such as television, or newsprint, or radio.
The CEN Exam, also called the Certified Emergency Nurse Exam, is a specific test for already registered nurses who want to work in the emergency field.
Why am I fascinated with characters like Sherlock Holmes or James Digriz or various other characters who tend to be on the outside of normal society.
And who seem to look at life with a different perspective, with the idea that there's something there to be seen and something there to be solved, something there to be deduced.
To learn something about somebody that may not be clear to everyone.
I think we all desire to know each other's stories and I think that is something that we're fascinated by and that's why Sherlock Holmes is a person that has been quite famous through out literary history.
I continue to find myself wanting to be that type of person.
Wanting to be observant of the world around me.
it's like, seeking out online discussions with people, how much is it serving us
And sometimes it might
Sometimes you might want to learn something, sometimes you might be looking for someone to help you change your mind about something
Sometimes, you might just be trying to gain more compassion for someone else, uh, even if they're very different than you
I've been a dance teacher for the past 10 years and It feels like my feet have been doing it for 30 years.
I considered having bunion surgery, but I soon nixed that off the list, not only because the cost was outrageous but the down time after surgery...I didn't have time to be out of work for that long!
One of my friends who's a professional dancer as well asked me if I've ever heard of Toe Stretchers.
I hadn't so I looked them up on Amazon, I picked out the ones she recommended these worked the best . She has tried a couple...and these things are awesome...there are in it... like a gel form...They are really cool They fit my feet perfectly.
So let me tell you, I was a little bit skeptical but she told me, she swore to the fact that these things work great.
And these are DenadaDance toe stretchers and it was the best decision I have ever made for my feet.
After a long day of class, I put the toe stretchers on, my feet feel relaxed, it feels like I have not even been dancing once I have these on for a while.
Goals Speaker: Dr. Erma Jean Sims, Sonoma State University There are four main goals to this session on illegal discrimination.
The first goal is to help teachers to understand what illegal discrimination is.
The second goal is to help teachers gain an awareness and understanding of the laws that pertain to illegal discrimination and how to prevent legal liability.
The third goal is to help teachers recognize their own assumptions, bias, and taken for granted realities that may foster illegal discrimination in their classrooms.
The fourth goal is to identify ways to prevent illegal discrimination and to provide a safe, supportive and positive environment for all children.
We will accomplish these goals by reviewing the law that pertains to illegal discrimination.
We will also discuss some scenarios on illegal discrimination.
This will give you an opportunity to make real world application of the law to these scenarios.
These scenarios are designed to heighten your conscienceousness to similar situations that you may encounter in your own classroom.
JIM LECINSKI: Brand marketers, as well as their agency partners and media partners, are full of terrific amounts of talent who can create great content with speed, with relevancy moving forward into the recovery But there is another group of people raising their hands saying, we can help, too.
We want to be part of the conversation.
And this is the proverbial tapping of the wisdom of the crowds.
Mastercard has done this very well with priceless.com, where consumers from all over the world come and say, here's an idea.
the water in, put your finger over the end and demonstrate how it holds the water back

Do this a couple times and say, "I can do this with air
" Then you get a straw you do the same thing
Pull the wrapper off get it statically charged
Then, you pick up the little pieces of paper by apparently trapping air inside by doing this
You're doing absolutely nothing because you have this one that is statically charged
Our student teachers teach usually our younger age groups between three and seven, at least for their first year
So they have ballet and tap and jazz classes
I have a few that have been with me since they were two and a half
And so you know now they're in high school and yeah it's amazing to see the transformation
I have one in particular that had two left feet when she started
She's now an amazing dancer and just, you know, teaching classes
She's on her way to So You Think You Can Dance someday too

Miss Tiffany describes it as me having two left feet
I think I was just kind of I didn't really
I was just kind of a space cadet
all teaching at our school
And that's really what I care about
Newhouse stands for great teaching
Now I have been honored to be the first person in the history of the Newhouse School to win the teacher of the year award twice
And I'm very humbled by that
But what is most important to me about that is that award is voted on by students
So I feel like I am a good teacher
And I feel like my students learn a lot
Now you should know my reputation is I am tough, but fair
And I very much want you to be successful
But that means I'm probably going to push you to do more than maybe you think you can
Now I do have confidence that you can actually do it
So it's going to be a lot of hard work
And you're going to learn all about the media business because that's the way the course is structured
Now it's important, I think because I came from the sales side but worked with agencies, that you understand those different perspectives of this business
Hey, I'm Tracey Goodwin, and I am going to teach you how to write a great speech.
Today we're going to look at all the elements involved in writing a great speech.
We're going to take a look at the introduction, and the most crucial crucial elements of an introduction.
or religion, or even faith
Atheists, agnostics and humanists share these values too
How do I know
Because when it comes to making statements about climate change, it's not just the Pope
Nearly every major Christian denomination, and world religion has something to say about it
From the Episcopal church, they say, "We are painfully aware, that those of us "living in the Northern Hemisphere are responsible "for the majority of climate change
Accordingly, "we hold a particular responsibility "for the changes that will reverse the trajectory "of atmospheric warming, and safeguard the sanctity "of what our God calls 'very good
'" From the other side of the world, here's part of the Hindu declaration on climate change
"We must consider the effect of our actions, "not just on ourselves, and those humans around us, "but on all beings
As an entrepreneur thinking about how you take feedback and how you figure out how you incorporate that feedback into your business.
I think the most important thing is, as an entrepreneur can you take a step back?
Can you back away from maybe a narrow problem you're trying to solve right now, and really look at the big picture?
And can you take the feedback that's coming in and apply it to the big picture, without being so distracted from what's happening in the weeds?
In particular for early stage companies, if you look at the founders and the co-founders, you know, they're selling the product, they're building the product, they're marketing it, they're doing customer service.
Whenever I talk to parents they want to know why is my kid taking all of these tests?
And one way I have explained it with parents a lot is kind of through a medical analogy.
So, you go to the doctor and um... you're not feeling well.
Well the doctor doesn't just go right into prescription mode and start telling you what medicines to take and what course of treatment he or she is going to offer.
Instead, the doctor takes the time to assess your state of being and gets to know you and what do you need and what's unique about you as a person.
And that's what assessment does for teachers with students.
It gives them information about their children as learners.
And before we go to teach them something let's first figure out what they already know.
This is financial planner Patrick Munro talking about what are financial assets.
It's important for individuals to realize that they have many assets in this life.
Your primary asset would be your family, people that care about you, etc.
And of course your health is an asset too, it's hard to have a valuable life without good health.
Hi my name is Lucy and I don't know much about investing.

Alright, now let's talk about non-verbals.
We're watching this video, or this, or if you're watching a video, now, if you just tape recorded you don't have to worry about this.
But if you're concerned about what you're going to do non-verbally, and you use a video tape to for your practice session.
In America, there are various savings vehicles that you as a working individual, can avail yourselves of, once you become out in the workforce.

- My name's Ashley Benvenuti and I graduated from Indiana Tech with a degree in human resources.
When I was looking at schools, I received financial aid packets, and you know, you can get kinda fearful by the price tag that you see on those.
Once I sat down with an admissions representative, I realized there was a lot of options for me.
Just because you get your financial package your freshman year doesn't mean you can't get more your following years.
I mean my case, I had more opportunities as I went along: academic, athletic scholarships, work-study positions.
It made me feel really comfortable and excited to know that I could come here without having to worry at the end of the day how much I was gonna have to pay to go to school.

" You are a good practitioner

Other people will react differently
They will hit him or tell him something very mean

You are reacting in a very different way
with tenderness, with loving kindness,

by the way one less thing as we leave you on june the men uh
and two, because it’s considered somehow less controversial than Huck Finn
Which it is, but it is also much less interesting
Right, so Huck Finn is one of those rare examples — like Aliens or The Empire Strikes Back — where the sequel outclasses the original
At first, Twain had a hard time writing the book
He began work in 1876 and wrote to a friend, “I like it only tolerably well…and may possibly pigeonhole or burn the manuscript when it is done
” And he did pigeonhole it for about six years, but then he returned to it in a frenzy of all-day, every day writing
Huckleberry Finn, the son of the town drunk, is the sidekick character in “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer
” He lives rough and never has to go to school and is pretty much the envy of all the other boys
But at the end of that first book he agrees to go and live with the Widow Douglas and become “sivilized” so that he can join Tom Sawyer’s gang
The question of what constitutes “getting sivilized” is at the very center of “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
” And so it begins right there, some time in the 1830s, a few decades before the Civil War
I don't know what the fuss is about.. I don't know what the big deal is about, I mean, I just came online to post my review about the day cream I bought last week at the mall, and I must say.. I'm seeing some negative feedback about the OroGold sales people but guys, you have to understand.. ..I was a salesperson once for a product that I really believed in and was truly passionate about before I moved to California and sometimes I too would get a bit over the edge with my consumers because I know the product REALLY works and guys, ORO GOLD PRODUCTS REALLLLLLY work, so before you go dissing the salespeople, try really listening to them first They are really knowledgeable about the OroGold cosmetics... let their products speak first because I have been using their product for JUST A WEEK and I can FEEL that my skin is feeling smoother than it has ever been.. Bottom line I don't see where the word "scam" fits into the Orogold cosmetics product line.
O.k., we are talking about types of persuasion and the last thing I want to talk to you about is really important.
I call it degrees of change and what I'm talking about is, what is it that you want to accomplish in your speech?
Do you want just a little bit of action taken?

I managed to become one of the worst presidents in Greece Furthermore, I teamed up with Europe and created the most destructive plan for the Greek people.
I never asked the people who voted me if they wanted these plans to be implemented I just did whatever Mrs. Merkel told me to do.
And look at what I have achieved!
I kept bullshit*ing my people, everytime with a new lie, the biggest of them being, the Wi-FI coverage I also paid tons of money to the media, to present me as the savior of Greece, but I failed.
talking about all of these people from that time of who she grouped out on

I was like okay I want to know what this woman has to say about that time period when she knew everybody
Boys in the trees by Carly Simon
This is her memoir
And I actually flipped through to the, to the end kind of and Carly Simon is actually a really beautiful writer which I guess isn't such a surprise since she writes you know her songs and we, we know a lot of them
What I did not know about her was that her dad was one of the founding partners of Simon &amp

You will absolutely feel scared and challenged
You'll working career you hadn't planned
You'll be asked to do things even if you don't have the credentials
A times, you'll have no idea what you're doing
Know this: the world out there thinks thats great
Succeeding despite not knowing what you're doing is the single most celebrated quality in business
People who KNOW what they're doing know it's possible and impossible

Boundaries are broken by people who don't know any better
So, I end this talk actually right where I started, with another one of my co-authors who at first reminded us to be nice

No community of peoples can freely pursue its happiness without the chances to associate, exchange ideas, and organize.
Their associating gives rise to organizations, distinct from government and absent from the market.
Designed to bring about public gains, these organizations, when benevolent in design, can improve the human and natural condition, empower people to move ahead, and generally contribute to the common good.
JOSEPH COWAN: What's going to define success is how we talk to the patient and how the patient responds to us.
As has been talked about many times here at the conference, we tend originally when we first start out in business, to think about this in terms of dollars and ROI.
I haven't yet met a pharma company, and the people within the pharma company, that haven't got an intense desire to help people.
But it's the employee's tool to own and to have those conversations, and it's nice and structured

And so, these sorts of resources are out there, as Stephen mentioned, but very few know about them
Again, a takeaway action for us is to consolidate those resources and get them out to our networks, and that'll happen post-today, as well

PENRY PRICE: The reality is that it's always been a mix of art and science and marketing.
I think that was something that we've noticed for forever really.
The direct marketers have been doing direct mail and email marketing, obviously, and other direct marketing techniques for years.
And there's always been that part of the math or the science that's been involved in communication.
The art of storytelling is still alive and well.
And I think the beauty of what now is sort of shaping the life that we all lead around communications is that you can have better science combining with the art that has always been top notch.
If you look around, what ad agencies continue to provide are incredible brand pictures or visuals or vignettes and what the emotion of that brand is.
Is marketing today more about individuals with lives?
Absolutely, that’s our philosophy at the ARF, you know, and what we’ve been able to get tremendous traction with.
Stan Sthanunathan who’s the global head of marketing strategy and insights at Coke Cola says “When you study consumers you get incremental change.
When you study humans you get breakthroughs.” It’s very important to understand that the word consumers means you’ve put a lens on somebody where you’re looking at them through the context of what you have to sell them.
You’ve stripped away all the complexity of how they live their lives.
And you’ve just simplified it to, you know, I’m looking at them relative to their consumption of this type of product.
This is financial adviser Patrick Munro talking about what is an interest only mortgage.
In the world of mortgage financing there are some exotic products that are available and more individuals are aware that having a home, and a bigger home at that is achievable if you are able to get involved in an interest only mortgage.

Hi, I'm Carmen Lynne with Expert Village.
So now I'd like to talk to you about the final, and actually the most important stage of dreaming.
If you remember, there are three stages, each stage is roughly 90 minutes long.
This final stage is called the venting stage, and it happens just before you wake up in the morning.
Have you ever had a dream just before you woke up in the morning that you felt was really quite negative and it kind of distressed you because you woke up thinking, now why did I have that dream?
Well, I'm here to tell you that that is actually a good sign.

My name is Philip Beningoso.
I'm an investment professional and I'm going to discussing how to invest in voting share stock.
Now there's a variety of way, and this is sort of a misnomer about voting share stock.
Ownership of the company with the "common stock". That is where you actually physically own a small piece of the company.
But there are many other types of investments out there that can be changed into common stock.
One of them being preferred stock or convertible preferred stock.

The reason why I might DNF something is like, is it confusing
Has it said some problematic things
Do I not like the main character
Is it hard to follow
Is the world-building to info-dumpy and/or not explained enough
All factors that might go into me thinking, "Hmm, I don't think i'm going to enjoy the rest of this
" And I think it's really valuable to be able to assert that if by page 50 I am 100% sure I'm going to give it a one-star rating, why continue it
If i'm not going to like it and it's taking me forever to get through and it's taking a bunch of my energy of me trying to pick up the book and get back to it, I'd just much rather put it in a box and pretend it never happened

Hi this is Nathaneal Mohr from the Marketing Blog GuaranteedProfit.com I hope your having a great day today.
In todays Marketing Blog post we have some really neat topics, the strategy we are going to talk about today is how to sell your services, if you have a service business, or products if you have actual physical products at business networking events.
Now I know that is normally a no-no.
And it should be, because we have all seen the person that has tried to sell their products and services at business networking events or in social networking opportunities, and scared a lot of people off because they didn't do it right.
It's not their fault they just weren't trained how to do it, thats all.
Don't get mad at them.
They are just trying to do their best, like all of us.
Saying that, before we get into that specifically I wanted you to know that it really doesn't matter if I am doing my best to be a top marketing blogger for small business owners, or medium sized business owners, or if I am doing my very best version to be a top small business speaker; all the advice that you'll find here at the marketing blog guranteedprofit.com  has been proven and tested.
So, if this is the first time that you have heard about this blog, I advise that you go ahead and take a look around and make a list of the small trainings that you can use and put them on a list of paper and then after you go through a few of them, prioritize them; which one should you first apply to your business to test, then second and third because when we came together as a team and decided to put up guaranteedprofit.com we decided to do our best to take actual trainings that we could sell for hundreds if not thousands of dollars and condense them into easy, or as easy as they could be applied.
Some of them are more advanced than others and are put here for free for you.
I would advise that you do that, take some time and enjoy it, let me know, I would love to hear your feedback.
Hello You Tube, this is Bozidar Djelic, Deputy Prime Minister of Serbian Minister of Science.
Many open questions today in Davos.
I pick one.
And that to recognize that over the last decade the growth or trade and the increase in investments in particular towards emerging countries have been very important factors in promoting democracy, social cohesion, and also taking a large number of people out of poverty.
That's something that happened too largely in Serbia as well.

This position was fifty percent longer than General Sickles old position
In addition to that, it now formed a salient or dangerous right angle and the left portion had significant gaps in the line
Sickles would send a staff officer to report his new position to headquarters

Sickles declined to attend because there was some fire along his segment of the line and he thought it best to remain with his soldiers

I want talk about coverage and continuity.
Now it should go without saying that the director has to make sure that everything gets taken care of on a movie set.
There are people there to help him but most of that burden is going to lay on his or her shoulders but two things that must be taken care of, must be taken care of on a movie shoot are coverage and continuity.
It is so important to have somebody working with the director who will say, somebody move that cup, she's not wearing the right shirt because continuity can destroy a scene if somebody is not, if something is not, does not have continuity in a scene there's often times, there's nothing you can do but re-shoot that scene.
So to know that everything is where it is supposed to be especially if you're shooting a scene on one day and completing it on the next day.
Where there's a break of time between when you shoot, you've got to make sure the continuity is there.

Dividends are incentives for those holding stock to continue to hold stock in that company.
It's almost like a benefit that's paid out to stockholders at the end of a period from the company.
Dividends are not required to be paid out however.
It is at the discretion of the company.
And many companies may choose not to pay out dividends but rather, reinvest in the business.
It doesn't mean that dividends are never due, they just accumulate over a period of time.
Companies may look to pay out dividends as incentives but again, reinvesting it in the business is usually the path that is chosen.
So dividends they are paid out to stock holders.
Usually to preferred stockholders first and then to common stockholders.

It does almost nothing to improve your ranking

We are here in order to work on the shark proposals, and we are particularly excited today because the shark proposals will come up tomorrow.
We have a big day for sharks, for porbeagles, spurdog, hammerhead sharks and oceanic whitetip.
And I think we have made a difference during the last days here.
We see a lot of countries in support of the proposals.
Innovation in marketing today is most defined by the word optimization.
And I would say the biggest difference in how we market today versus how we marketed a decade or so ago, was that we really need to spend a lot less time in the lab cooking it up first and a lot more time optimizing in real time in the world.
That’s scary and this goes back to what are safe risks.
Well safe risks that we ought to be taking is-- are making decisions about our marketing efforts closer to when we want to put them in market, being confident about putting ‘em out when they are mostly baked instead of fully baked, listening to and responding to what the community tells us, inviting their participate and co-creation and constantly iterating.
categories there are special norms at the national level and internationally

It did seem that her comments on TV ran afoul of that rule
And so the real question, though, is some of these rules are more easily enforced in real government agencies than they are at the White House
Usually it's the White House, the White House counsel, or the president that has to decide how they'll be enforced
There may be another mechanism to try to go after her, but, you know, the White House so far has indicated that, you know, Sean Spicer said that she had been counseled

If I know that there is an entity on campus that I can feel comfortable coming to, because a lot of times people don't know how to approach people in SGA or in the main office or they don't understand how to properly word a question when they go to admissions or something like that, they can get that guidance here
They can also have an initiative to keep their academics as high as possible
The academics, as well, is something we take pride in
We make sure that every member in the organization has the best academics as possible
Basically, the difference between Minority Male Mentoring and NEXT LEVEL is the NEXT LEVEL program is like the club or organization recognized by SGA
So it's kind of similar to, I guess, Gamma on campus - similar to those type of organizations and they do organization and club related events

Hi I'm Tim Spransy, the pastor of worship arts here at Crosspoint Church and I'm just gonna take a couple minutes to tell you about scripture that has been speaking to me lately.
I read uh... in Acts chapter sixteen about the uh... account of Paul and Silas and when they were imprisoned and it's pretty remarkable story when you really read into the detail of it, but kind of an overview is they got  the local people really upset they ended up getting severely beaten and flogged and thrown in prison for the night and uh... I got to thinking about the condition of the prison and how miserable that must have been there's there's reason to believe it was either pitch black or at least a very very dark so if you can imagine being in a place like that where you've just been beaten.
You're thrown into prison and your not sure what's gonna happen next.
Well, what they do, around midnight the scripture says, they start praying and singing hymns.
Essentially worshiping God and I think that this is such a fantastic response to that circumstance because what happens then is there's this tremendous earthquake and the prison doors break open and shackles are loosing from their feet and they're free to go.
They actually stay and lead the prison guard and his whole family to the Lord.
A lot of people get saved and they eventually do you get free.
I think what we look at when we read that scripture is we look at the miracle of the earthquake in the prison opening.
But to me uh... a miracle of equal billing is the fact that they were able to respond the way they did in such a horrific circumstance.
They worshiped God uh... and that's a lesson that we can take from our lives and apply it into our lives when we get into, we all find ourselves in, very difficult situations and circumstances and what God wants us to do is to turn to Him and give Him thanks despite or because of our circumstances and worship Him.

Also I went online and you know did some research the Deaf Blind Association, their website and things like that
So that was what I didn't know
Also I will include links below for you guys if you are interested in more information

Ok first I want to emphasize when I say Deaf Blind that does not mean necessarily a person is fully deaf and fully blind
It varies just like people who are only deaf, you know their hearing loss varies
Some people are Hard of Hearing, they can hear quite a bit
Some people are fully deaf and they can't hear anything, and the same goes with Deaf Blind
Some people may be more deaf and less blind
Some of them might be fully blind and can hear a little bit more
So, again it just kind of varies
something that you don't practice, it just doesn't really work
Unfortunately this world makes us practice things that we don't want to be good at

We have a lot of practice at that
They asked us to spend a lot of our time dealing with it
They ask us to use blinders and we're very practiced at it

The more we scapegoat, the better we are at it and the better you are it, the more you practiced
Dodging responsibility, the more you do it, the better you'll get and so envy the people that can't do it cuz they haven't had to practice this bullshit
Look and see what they're asking you to practice
And how often do they ask you to put around your neck a noose everyday
Jesus is calling His children to COME OUT and be separate from everything that is wicked and ungodly.
Sadly MOST people are associating with other people who are stuck in SIN, and because of this, that wickedness rubs off on them and they are NOT able to walk with Jesus but they are pulled off the road of righteousness.
If you hang out with people who are wicked, who go on sinning they WILL corrupt you.
Rather you NEED to COME OUT and be separate from EVERYONE who is living in sin, whether they call themselves Christians or whether they are not a believer at all.
To summarize, in it we have some very powerful data automation capabilities and these also predefined built in methods which allow you to do operations on the whole struct.

And so we split up the parts of the report so everybody had their own part
And then at the end we kind of put all our parts together for the report
And so we did that

You know, it was really shoddy work and so me and the other group members were really upset
We put a lot of effort into our part but Rick didn't do his part well
But we interact with this world with our hand, and today it is not possible to interact with a natural action in virtual reality
So we built a device, which is showing here we built a device, which is showing here on this finger, that is capable to recreate the sense of touch while interacting with the object
what we can do: if you see a button you can click can click a button, but actually you can feel it
When you can feel it, you can forget that you are in can you can forget that you are in virtual reality
At least for this basic human interaction strategies
Because if we can make someone click a button that means that we don't have to explain him what he has to do
Because it's so natural to see something and click it with his hand
Hello You Tube I'm Ian Bremmer and I'm taking about whether or not Obama is going to make a difference for the better in 2009. He certainly isn't going to make a difference for the worst, but the question is how much he can really do.
No one here at the world economic forum really thinks that the economy is going to improve significantly before 2010. So there are limitations there.
And secondly there's a question of just how much time and effort the Obama administration is going to be able to actually put outside of the United States.
And I'm sitting here at Davos, I was actually asked the other day on CNBC, about whether I was sad that there weren't any Americans here.

Thats one way to do it

Today on REI TV, were gonna be talking about real estate marketing solutions.
How do you get homes?
If you have a home, how do you sell it?
Do you do it yourself?
Do you list it for sale by owner?
Do you go through a realtor?
And most importantly, are actually on the right side of defense to make the most money.
Alright, when it comes to real estate marketing solution, you’ve gotta ask yourself first of all; Are you the home owner or are you the realtor?
Because a realtor can charge a 3% commission, you got another 3% that goes out to the other agent involved.
There’s the buyer and sellers side or you can be the investor.
So which of those 3 are you?
If you’re talking about listing a house, I always list with the realtor and I always do my paperwork with realtors.
Why do I do that?
Well, for protection, for that legal paper work to make sure things are done and because I want maximum exposure.
If I’m an investor and I put a tenant in the house with a lease option; meaning like rent to own?Well that person’s actually gonnastep in and buy the house.
I don’t need a realtor.
You see investors are smart.
Investors know how to maximize profitability and sometimes it pays to have a realtor, sometimes it doesn’t.
It depends on your strategy.
So you’ve got realtors that are leveraging real estate as a job.

Now, the topic we'll use as our sample is this one: Is it better to study online or in a regular classroom

I'm Romie Brown.
On behalf of Expert Village, I'm here to discuss your tips and tidbits on how to buy homeowner's insurance.
In this clip, we're going to discuss underwriting philosophies and eligibility for coverage for insurance companies.
One thing that's very important is that you realize that there are guidelines to getting insurance.
Just because you buy a new home doesn't mean that it is eligible for coverage.
So some of the things we have to consider is: the age of the home.
Are there any perils at home, any slip, trip and falls?
See if there are any prior losses.
You can get this by talking to your insurance agent about doing a report, like a clue report, on said property, to make sure there are no prior losses.
Hey everybody what is up i Just wanted to do a quick review as well as my thoughts on the Kanye West and Paul Mccartney collaboration.
Actually this collaboration was rumoured about a month ago or two ago or even earlier than that in the press that these two collaborated and every one was curious was what the song was and now we've finally heard it.
The song is called Only One.
It's pretty subdued from what I was expecting to hear.It's got Paul McCartney on the piano and it's got Kanye West in a very mellow kind of song.
he's singing about his mother whom he lost a couple of years ago.
It came as a big disappoint to a lot of people and it's a pretty disappointing song to me . I think a lot of people had a lot of expectations about what the song would be but i think a lot of the time we have these amazing musicians get together and they try to make music and they have amazing music on their own but together they just don't have chemistry and they can't make good music.
it almost feels like kanye had a left over demo and said hey paul you want to play on this and paul sat at a piano and played the first thing that came to his mind and they probably released it and you know i think the biggest thing that's surprising about this song is that a lot of kanye fans don't know who Paul McCartney and there's a lot of tweets about people saying who is this Paul McCartney guy?
And the thing I want to say is that this generation has to be the dumbest generation that I have ever seen.
And I am a young guy and I am only 28. And in a day and age where we have access to so much information If i don't know what something is I google it.

It's very relevant because it's exactly what they want.
Scored less marks in MBA entrance exams/ CAT/ CET exams?
Thinking of what to do?
Didn't get admission in good college?
What can you do about this
Start by breaking the film or TV show into smaller sections
For example, watch five or ten minutes at one time
Don’t use subtitles here: just relax and try to understand what you can

When you’ve finished, pause and ask yourself these questions
Can you explain what happened in three to five sentences
Who was in the film or TV show

Can you remember anything specific they said
Try to make some notes about what you’ve just seen
Make a few bullet points, like this: The man arrived at the party and started talking with the woman

I'd like to define Yoga for our purposes in Vinyasa Yoga today.
The word Yoga can be translated in English to Union.
Yoga is over five thousand years old.
And the Union that Yoga is referring to is first there is the awe, the super consciousness.
(Professor Leonard Glantz, Boston University School of Public Health):  I think that epidemiology itself doesn't claim that it can show that a particular individual got a disease from an exposure.
What epidemiology does, as I understand it, is to show that certain risks exist for populations and increase the chances of the population having a greater number of events than  other populations.
But epidemiologists are not diagnosticians, and they don't show that a particular condition in a particular person was caused by a particular event.
And that's what the law is about.
The law requires us showing that a particular person got a particular disease for a particular reason.
And since things happen to people for all kinds of reasons.
Leukemia exists absent these chemicals.

It's definitely an opportunity for you to meet people that you would never have the chance to meet in person
And to, I guess the best way to put it is, to educate yourself for different industries as well
On LinkedIn you can learn about Under Armour, you can learn about Google, you can learn about Target, so it's definitely a tool that you can utilize
So if anyone gets on LinkedIn, definitely have an awesome profile picture, update your contact information
Because, as a recruiter, we do look at that
Your job is to differentiate yourself and to get to be the audacious person that cuts through all the clutter
So how do you do that
Hi, this is Eric Sterns with Expert Village.
We are discussing signaling for purposes of emergency situations.

Hi, guys today i'm going to talk about Software industry
Even though it’s only a few decades old, by now the computer software industry has been one of the fastest growing industries
The software industry has transformed the way organizations, businesses, and even people coordinate and work
Its impact on the global economy and across various industries can be gauged by the increase in innovations, technical progress, enhanced productivity, and the workforce
The software industry is highly concentrated with few players contributing to the overall revenue of the industry
For example, Microsoft dominates the personal computer market, SAP AG is the leader in the enterprise application software segment, and Salesforce
com dominates customer relationship management
The software industry has long been associated with high margins
Even during the slowing down of economy, this industry has managed to stay afloat
I'm Dan Carlson, I'm a nurse and what we're going to go through today is how to stop a simple urinary tract infection.
There's certain things that are very effective in preventing your chances of getting an UTI, a urinary tract infection.
Cranberry juice is the main one.
That's a very effective technique, maybe to use it about three times a day would be a good idea.
What you're looking at though is preventing a urinary tract infection and if you have a serious urinary tract infection, you definitely want to consult a physician as you may need antibiotics and certain things like that to help you through the process.
Cranberry juice is the most effective way to prevent a urinary tract infection.

Being in the military was certainly great preparation for business school and for the program I‘m in.
When I came to business school with my military background, I had experience in technical operations, technical management, I had experience in making a lot of decisions with imperfect information, I had a lot of training in leading and managing people, dealing with complex systems, complex personnel issues.
In the military you’re a leader from day 1, and I was able to step up and assume leadership roles in my class and in different teams that I’m working on in my classes.
The challenges that you face in the military are certainly well suited to prepare you, anyone in the military for business school.
What are the fun parts about business school?

SECRETARY KERRY: Put simply, the solution to our economic future isn’t shutting the door to trade; it’s opening the door to a system that will make trade work for everybody.
And TPP is, by far, the best way to build that system today.
SAM TRUJILLO: Well, the advice I would have for integrating online strategy into their marketing strategy, IS just look at it as a simple piece of the marketing mix.
Depending on the priority you place you have television, you have print, you have digital, and you have other vehicles that use business to business, or consumer.
It needs to be at the right place at the right time, and don't think about it as either or.
Hi, my name is Greg Doyle.
I'm a senior political science major here at Heidelberg University and over the past four years I've had a really great opportunity, and set of opportunities, to really find what I want to do and who I want to be within the political science field.
I'm heavily involved in Model United Nations here Both on campus and at a conference in San Francisco I've had plenty of opportunities to present at national conferences in St.
Louis, Chicago and even Columbus Also I guess what really makes this major and my experience in particular really special has been the interaction and the proximity that I have the professors.
Before you begin playing the violin; one of the most important things you can do is understand all of the parts, and exactly what they're for in the violin.
When you're going down the violin; one of the very first things people notice is the scroll.
It's there at the top of the violin; not only for beauty, but to also act as a buffer if; say I didn't have the scroll, and I were to turn the violin sideways, I could knock off any of the pegs; any of the strings.
Many schools will post their course catalog and in some cases I know at NYU Wagner we post course syllabi and course evaluations online so that you can really understand what sort of material is being covered in different courses
You know contacting alumni perhaps of those schools that are doing whatever it is that you want to do

This is where you get everything you need to know in 90 seconds at 9 o’clock, including news full of key data today.
In the US, sales of new homes in October were reported to be a remarkable 25% higher than the September level.
The median price was US$245,800 (NZ$300,000). This Saturday we will get the November Non-farm payroll report, but today we got the pre-cursor ADP survey and at +215,000 this came in much higher than analysts were expecting.
The US economy imported more and exported more in October, and had a trade deficit of US$40 billion, which was about the expected level and slightly lower than previously.
But unexpected was the softer confidence on services, which fell quite sharply.
New orders and business activity were strong, but the employment component was much weaker.
Markets are awaiting the Federal Reserves Beige Book review of current economic conditions which we will update as soon as it is published.
Eurpoean regulators announced big fines for another six banks in the LIBOR scandal investigation, this time including two American banks.
That now tallies up to US$6 billion so far in this crackdown.
In more legal news, the US Attorney General said they are close to some big new civil fraud cases against more big US banks early in the new year, following up on the huge US$13 bln JPMorgan settlement.
According to Ernst &amp; Young's latest six-monthly Capital Confidence Barometer, about a third (30%) of Australasian businesses – twice as many as six months ago – now believe the global economy is improving.

Just how powerful is this endorsement? Heineman says he won't be backing any candidates for U

"The reason is because the job I care most about is my successor it is the most important job in Nebraska
- So let's talk about the paradoxes of sustainability.
First, what's a paradox?
To find love, you have to stop looking for it.
The same is true of happiness, evidently.
A paradox is a statement or proposition that seems self-contradictory, but in reality expresses a truth.
Here are four key points from Vojinov's paper.
MATTHEW SHADBOLT: Experimentation has been absolutely critical to everything that we've been doing online.
We have no secret formula of being able to understand exactly what is going to work.
Hi I'm Jim Teteak from Rule the Room &amp; you're about to learn how to deliver money-making presentations using tools and techniques that most business professionals will never know
If you're looking to advance your career, boost your income level, persuade your clients or customers, or motivate and inspire your coworkers, then this is the course for you
Even if you are comfortable speaking in front of an audience - in meetings, keynotes, and other public speaking venues, you're about to gain a competitive advantage by learning dozens of powerful techniques you've never seen before to sell your ideas, add value to your small talk, overcome your nerves, and make an incredible impression
And if you are concerned that your fear of public speaking is holding you back from advancing in your career, we'll give you concrete steps you can take to stand in front of an audience and deliver your message comfortably
This is one of our most popular workshops for professionals
That's probably because we surveyed hundreds of business leaders, entrepreneurs, and independent consultants to determine the top 8 things they needed to give effective business presentations
This program addresses all eight
Let me just tell you how this course is organized so you can get a feel for what's in store
In the first section, you'll learn how to turn any topic, no matter how boring, into one that fascinates and holds the attention of your audience

you'll learn how to overcome your fear of public speaking, and feel less nervous when you're in front of an audience, so that your audience feels safe with you
In section 2, you'll learn how to make comfortable small talk, to help you land more clients, and build rapport with your coworkers
This is one of the top things that business clients want to know - 'How do I talk to people 1 on 1?' Next you'll learn how to keep your audience listening, even after 45 minutes
Why 45 minutes? Studies show that people's minds start to wander about every 10 minutes
Its called the drifting theory
But even more importantly after 45 minutes the drifting interval starts to quickly speed up and you really risk losing your audience
You're going to learn the tools you can use to keep them on the edge of their seat no matter how long your presentation
And finally in section 2, you'll get the answer to one of the most common questions business leaders ask: "How do I tailor my message for the specific people in the room?" You're going to learn how to do it, even on the fly
In section 3, you'll find out how to handle to challenging people in your audience
The gripers, complainers, resenters, experts, talk-hogs, quite types, and know-it-alls
These people can quickly derail a presentation so you need to know how handle them and stay on track
You'll learn the top 10 most common presentation mistakes and how to fix them or avoid them to start with
And finally, you'll learn how to use the top 5 best practices in public speaking to deliver a convincing persuasive message to your audience
Thank you for taking this course
Now, the first type of method of delivery is impromptu, and impromptu is where you and the topic meet for the first time and you have zero preparation time to speak about the particular topic.
You have become more and more involved in watching the stock market and specifically, the rise and fall of the price of shares of individual stocks for individual corporations and you have been hearing terminology that you're not exactly familiar with and you'd like to know more information.
One of the frequently ask questions is what's the difference between a nonprofit corporation and a for profit corporation.
Certainly, you don't want to invest in a corporation that's not for profit.
We've just adopted a new scoping plan for California's climate program.
It's five years into AB 32 and now we're moving onwards.
So my story begins with kind of my upbringing, my background
I am from a one-hundred percent Italian family
Being Italian means that your faith is to be Catholic, it's your identity or I've been told it's my license in life
I saw a flyer up at Wheeling High School and they were looking for people to help with run some tech for a show
And so I built up the courage and I went and through that opportunity I met a friend Steve Luecht
Many times Steve would invite me to church or to youth group and such but kind of going back to my time as being Catholic and such, I've been taught and trained there was "Oooh to go to anything that wasn't Catholic was bad and wrong
" You know God was working on my heart and softening it to finally, three years later, to finally decide "Hey I'll go with you
" It really just stuck out for me starting there was, wow this is a community of people that love each other and care for for each other
Fast forward a couple more weeks Steve's parents, Wayne and Terry Luecht, offered Steve Luecht and Joel Alvarado to sleep over on a Saturday night
Now this was a Saturday night that we had homecoming so it was very convenient and very easy
But, one of the things that his parents said to Joel and I said hey "if you sleep over Saturday night we go to church early on Sunday so we really want you to come with us" and so you know I started to build trust in them and so I was like all right I'll I'll go with you, and it was really interesting because this was the first time that I had been to a church experience where it was very engaging and very very real
And why I say real is when the pastor came up to the to the pulpit he opened his Bible and then he said please join me in open your Bible, and if you don't have one there's one in the pew in front of you
Again it was just another way that God was building on my heart that the Christian walk is real and it's alive
One weekend in October we needed to dig a hole for the new sign that's in front of our church, so you know a couple of us guys and girls, you know we went and helped dig that hole for the sign in the front of the church
But then that night after we digged it the whole it filled up with water because it started raining, and so Steve being a very handy guy and very involved in the church, he he said "hey Jerry come with me we're going to throw a sump pump in that hole and then we're gonna get that water out of there"
This was such an important moment for me because I had started coming to church going to youth group and hearing about God's love and how there is a savior that you need
Sitting at that hole and looking up at the front of the church, looking at the cross, and putting all this together and then looking back at that hole and realizing if I don't accept this Savior this this God I'm going to go into this hole and I'm going to go to hell
And that moment that hole became very real, it became hell, it became hell for me per se and I knew that I needed to rise out of that hole and accept God's free gift of salvation for my life
So that was around about October 22nd 1998 I accepted the Lord is as my savior
And one of the things that I have continued to struggle with, which I mentioned at the beginning, was what's my identity
Who is Jerry? When you are with Christ when you are saved you cannot hold anything back you need to be fully one hundred percent on board to follow him for your life
Hey this is Jean-Paul from Futuro Video Marketing (Advertising Agencies London) you found this video because we ranked this video that's basically all we do!
Hi, Tom "Big Al" Schreiter here.
Looking forward to September 14 and 15 with the Swiss Halley partners, to learn exactly what to say and exactly what to do.
Chris here with Health Plus, just wanted to talk about 2 really awesome products from Plexus Worldwide tonight.

Missing witnesses at trial, are they fair game during summation?
You want to learn the answer?
Come join me.
Hi, I'm Gerry Oginski; I'm a New York medical malpractice and personal injury trial attorney practicing law here in the state of New York.
There are many times during the course of trial where the defense will not bring in a particular witness and as a result we may be entitled to get what's called a missing witness charge.
Now, here's an example.
As part of your lawsuit you claim that you're entitled to receive compensation because of somebody else's wrongdoing.
The defense has an absolute right to have you sent to a doctor of their choosing to examine and evaluate your current injuries.
Now, as your case progresses to trial and once you're at trial we have to put on whatever proof is necessary to prove your case.
In law, a conviction is the verdict that results when a court of law finds a defendant guilty of a crime.
The opposite of a conviction is an acquittal.
In Scotland and in the Netherlands, there can also be a verdict of "not proven", which counts as an acquittal.
There are also cases where the court orders that a defendant not be convicted, despite being found guilty; in the England, Wales and Canada the mechanism for this is a discharge.
For a host of reasons, the criminal justice system is not perfect, and sometimes guilty defendants are acquitted, while innocent people are convicted.
Appeal mechanisms mitigate this problem to some extent.
An error which results in the conviction of an innocent person is known as a miscarriage of justice.
After a defendant is convicted, the court determines the appropriate sentence as a punishment.
Furthermore, the conviction may lead to results beyond the terms of the sentence itself.
Hi everyone my name is Kaitlyn McGuirk and welcome to my youtube channel.
I'm currently completing my last semester of the Bachelor of Commerce program at Memorial University with a concentration in Marketing.
Once I graduate I'm going to continue my studies at Ryerson University in Toronto and complete my masters in professional communication.
Why did we go off the gold standard?
Do you think if the government had to base its spending on a real   standard of money instead of a system based on paper and fraud we'd be in the financial trouble we're in today?
You have a corporation and you are coming to terms that you often haven't often used in the past and one of them is a share holder.
We had some other innovations that we preceded the British Parliament with, such as, we had a Department of Parliamentary Debates before the British Parliament did.
Shopper marketing has been around forever.
It’s been around a lot longer than any other medium.
But it-- but promotions at retail were never considered very important, not for the last 40 or 50 years.
You could reach the American audience with television, extremely effectively.
If you’re of a certain age, and I’m 50, and everybody my age, wherever you were in the country, watched the exact same television programs.
There were three networks, maybe a couple local stations.
Box and pointer notation is a new edition to environment diagrams.
Let me tell you about a property of data types.
A method for combining data values satisfies the closure property.
If the result of combination can itself be combined using the same method?
Closure is the key to power in any means of combination because it permits us to create hierarchical structures.
So, what's going on here?
I'm explaining that if when you combine data values together, you can then combine those values together, etc., then you can build a hierarchy.
Hierarchical structures are made up of parts which themselves have parts and those have parts and those have parts and so on.
For your final two levels of competition, generic competition and budget competition, think larger scale.
Now, generic competition includes products and services that fulfill the same customer needs.
So, a generic competition for our flavored water here, would be any other drink that our potential customer can choose.
So, regular water, sparkling water, juice, tea, sports drink, sodas, you get the picture.
Hi, I'm Carmen Lynne with Expert Village, and we are talking today about dreams and dream analysis.

Hi Guys I just wanted to share my thoughts with you about the "TAO of Badass" book and the results my students are getting with this.
As a female, I see so many guys simply doing the WRONG thing when it comes to girls and i think it's a really important skill to build and improve on.
I've noticed a lot of guys don't understand that every interaction with a woman takes the same course and follows a certain path.
YOU HAVE TO LEAD HER DOWN THAT PATH GENTLEMEN!
We use both, again, we use Aprimo software internally and we use Omniture.
Well, I think for us it’s-- the way to leverage technology for innovation has been an interesting one for us.
JOHN GERZEMA: When I think about finding insights for consumers, I think it's really sort of the interplay between the analytical and the conceptual.
Clearly because everything is data driven today and is so measurable, analytics for me are really important.
In addition to the personal statement... some schools may ask you to submit another statement called the diversity statement... and that is your opportunity to outline to the school about yourself... in a very different way and perhaps a more personal way... than you have demonstrated in your personal statement.
This is an opportunity for you... to share with the admissions committee information about yourself... that you believe sets you apart in many different ways... from the candidates who are applying as well.
The diversity statement does not need to be limited... to the discussion about racial or ethnic diversity.
It can be a description about who you are as an individual... and why you believe you would be best suited for not only a legal education... but also the opportunity to enroll at the law school of your choice.
Use it as an opportunity to really demonstrate to the schools who you are... and how, as a diverse student, you will assist that student body.
Know that we will keep your confidence... and we will appreciate and value whatever you tell us.
Hello, my name is Emily Gasner.
I'm with Working Solutions, and I'm here to talk about how to obtain funding for your business idea.
So, step one, is you need to develop your business idea.
I recommend that you pick something that you have business and industry experience, having done in the past.
Because it will make it much easier to convince an entity, whether it's a bank, a friend, a family member, an alternative lending source, like a non-profit organization that makes loans, to lend you money if you do have experience, doing the type of business, you want to start.
Hello, welcome back to Candida Crusher again



This is an FAQ from Marjorie in Connecticut, USA
Does a yeast infection cause or increase the allergic response? Marjorie's email here states that she's been suffering from food allergies and believes she has Candida and wants to know if there is a link
Well, there certainly is, and in many cases of people with yeast infections, I have found they have a condition known as Leaky Gut Syndrome, which can predispose a person to food allergies
Not everybody with Candida has Leaky Gut, but certainly many people with food allergies will have a leaky gut
And often leaky gut and Candida and food allergies all seem to belong to the same person, for want of a better word
So how do you get rid of the allergic response? You get rid of the allergic response by improving the small intestine function
And a key way to do that is to reduce foods which contribute to dysbiosis, to start taking in foods and particular products which are particularly affective in eradicating yeast and bad bacteria, and also to reintroduce beneficial bacteria
But at the same time, understand the very important connection between stress and the gut
If the person is Deaf and uses Sign Language, book with iSign for a Sign Language Interpreter in advance.

To be eligible to take the exam, potential testers must have graduated from a postsecondary medical assisting program accredited by either the United States Department of Education or the Council for Higher Education Accreditation.
The test itself consists of four 40-minute segments containing a total of 200 multiple-choice questions.
There are three major content sections on the exam, General, Administrative, and Clinical, each of which cover a wide variety of topics and concepts.
Testing centers can be found around the country, and testers are allowed to schedule to take the exam at their convenience.
- University of Illinois candidates are very prepared and have a great pre-dental club, and that is something I believe that students who are interested in dentistry should engage and be part of.
Not only the pre-dental club, but all the other organizations you have on campus.
It’s such a rich program, school, undergraduate program that students should really take advantage of all of the opportunities that they have.
Take a lot of classes, not obviously just science-based courses, to try and diversify their background.
But, mainly I would say is take advantage of all the opportunities that you have at U of I.
It’s such a rich undergraduate program.
I believe in Jesus because I have met Him and He loves me and leads me, He protects me and He has proven to me that He is real MANY times.
I don't believe in Jesus just because I have read the Bible from my youth.
It is a very sad thing that so many Christians DO know the Bible, they have a lot of knowledge of the Bible but they have never actually met Jesus.
It is such a blessing to know the Lord Jesus, to hear from HIM and to have LIFE in HIS NAME.
If you are someone who is really seeking the LORD and wants to know TRUTH, I encourage you to go directly to Jesus in prayer, ask HIM for answers and clarity and ask HIM to reveal Himself to YOU in a way that makes sense.
You will NEVER know the truth just by reading the Bible, you HAVE to get to know JESUS if you want eternal life.
Sometimes they'll use the "v", sometimes they'll just use the "a"
Be prepared to listen to both

Let's look at a few more examples
Okay, so now we're going to look at some other situations
For example, when "of" is followed by an "h"
Now, again, for native speakers the "h" is a very weak sound so we
Quite often we just drop it
We just blend it into whatever came before and after

My advice for companies wanting to integrate online into their marketing strategies is that it's not so much an integration issue, it's where you start in the process.
And you have to start with the consumer.
Meaning it's not much different than what you currently do with all of your planning.
A lot of the questions, again, are asking about the coping aspect within families and things like that.
The best thing that anybody can do is to have as much open communication about it within a close-knit family and have all the information possible.
So that usually means medical intervention, psychological intervention.
Sometimes it's a support group.
I have a lot of husbands and wives come into my practice where they have a partner who is bipolar and a lot of it is really helping to understand when the symptoms come on, any of the patterns.
Couples who get together as a team on this stuff tend to do better than people who work on it in isolation.
So it's really important that you have all of the information at your disposal.
But unfortunately these 7,000 languages are decreasing: languages are alive, they change, evolve, and unfortunately many disappear
About ⅓ of these languages are in danger of extinction, most of them are spoken by fewer than 1,000 people, across one or two generations
And this means that without the right policies for conservation, about 25 languages disappear every year, and with them, their culture
On the other hand, ⅔ of the world's population speak one of the 12 most widely spoken languages in the world
All in all, you can choose to save one of the endangered languages, or to learn one of the most spoken languages in the world

HEATHER DOUGHERTY: In Canada, there's a couple really interesting broad trends that I've noticed when digging through our data.
And one is Canadians love online banking.
They check online banking accounts on a pretty regular basis.
And so it's one of the most popular activities online that we've seen.
And the other is really rewards programs.
Collecting points, collecting rewards is another one, where we've seen lots and lots of activity.
Hi, Today I’m here to tell you about madhippie.com.
It’s a great new skin care product line and it is called Mad Hippie, yes I said that correctly.
And they carry all natural skin care products that help reduce discoloration and signs of aging, like you know, appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and I have to tell you I’ve been using it for right under 60 days, which is what they guarantee that in and they’re not lying because I literally have seen a huge change, especially in the discoloration of my skin.

You see a barrage of negative news story feeds us this is lie that behavior doesn't matter

Problem, problem, problem, problem, no discussion of solutions
There are millions of things in this world beyond our control
The problem is when our brain starts to believe that all things are beyond our control
Hi so you are thinking about getting a mortgage or going to get a mortgage but you heard the prepayment penalties from your mortgage broker or from your lender and you want to avoid that.
No problem I can certainly tell you how to do that.
My name is Adriel Torres and I'm the owner of ultimate credit today dot com.
Now what a prepayment penalty is, is basically if you pay the loan before it's due then they'll charge you a certain amount of money, whatever that may be.
And in order to avoid that, most lenders will have a charge up front that you can actually buy the prepayment completely off the loan.
And what I mean by that is usually a half a point or a point to buy the two years to three years.
I'm financial adviser Patrick Munro talking to you today about what is an annuity?
An annuity is one of the oldest financial instruments available out there to anyone to participate in.
An annuity is also the safest vehicle that you can get as well.
It's an insurance instrument, and many people have their houses insured, their cars are required to be insured as well.
PHAP has solidified my interest in writing and communications and my passion for it.

- Well, church today was pretty lonely without the kids and Kendra there
And the home is quiet
I can't help but think back to when I was 12 years old
There are six kids in my family, and my parents got divorced
Before the divorce, my dad was there everyday with us
He was my little league coach
He would help us out with speeches for student council elections
Whatever was going on, he was there
And then after the divorce, we moved several hours away from him and he moved into some apartment building and was alone
And I know that that was a difficult, lonely time for him
And the truth is sometimes with four kids, I get kinda grumpy
Grumpy with the chores, the changing of the diapers, the constant messes, the tantrums
But being away from them is a good reminder to me of how important they are to me

Testimony of Vitor Kobbaz about the Shaman Gideon of the Lakotas and the Ceu Nossa Senhora da Conceição Hello, my name is Vitor Kobbaz.
I am a web designer and photographer, I live in Pindamonhangaba in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
I met the Shaman Gideon of the Lakotas four years ago, at the time I was addicted to drugs and depressed, resulting in many conflicts with my family.
Today I am happily working and studying, and completely recovered from addictions.
I owe it to a person named Shaman Gideon of the Lakotas.
When I met this person, I could observe him working very hard for the good of the people, with great humility and simplicity.
The people who speak ill of him, are uninformed, and the ignorance is a great evil of the humanity, the ignorance blinds, the ignorance attacks, the ignorance creates a wall around us that don’t let the good things to come in.
When you hear somebody speaking ill of Gideon and the work that he leads here on earth, the Ceu Nossa Senhora da Conceição, try to seek information about it, try to get to know the work.
This in an appeal to your intelligence.
Hi, this is Ashish Dass from India applying for Master’s in Information Systems at your university Technology has always fascinated me I have watched it, learnt it and tried to be a part of it as much as possible.
This was my motivation behind pursuing Engineering, with a specialization, in Information Technology.
Having completed my Engineering, and having worked for more than 2 years in Tata Consultancy Services I now, plan to return back to academics.
This decision is driven by my aim, to pursue a career as a Business Analyst in IT Industry.
Even before joining TCS, I interned as a co-software developer for an application called “Maxe-Controls”. Here, raw data was fed to the system, regarding the purchase behavior of the buyer and reports were generated based on that.
Working closely with managers, and the CEO of the company, I realized, the important role, data analysis plays in achieving the desired results.
In the near future, I plan on taking responsibilities, wherein I would act as a liaison between business and technical team.
In the long run, I see myself taking up PROJECT &amp; PROGRAM MANAGEMENT ROLES.
Wherein, I would be responsible for completing an End to End process, for any given composite IT issue.

AMBASSADOR-AT-LARGE VERVEER: For over a decade, Refugees International has been a strong voice for improved and sustainable humanitarian responses for women and girls around the globe.
Issuing a number of groundbreaking reports, Refugees International has been a leader in efforts to improve protection of civilians by peacekeepers.
It has also worked to improve United Nations peacekeeping mandates and the training of UN peacekeepers, focusing on protection, particularly of women, girls, and other vulnerable groups.
As the United States’ Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women’s Issues, I’ve worked closely with Refugees International on a number of important issues ranging from the U.S.

This is financial adviser Patrick Munro talking about loans without a checking account.
The researchers suggested the compounds could mix because the methane molecules got compressed to the point where they could slip into the network of bonds connecting all the water molecules, and distribute themselves evenly
There’s methane and water all over the solar system, including inside planets and moons, where the pressure can be super high
So studying how they react under extreme conditions in the lab can help us learn more about the chemistry going on in places it’s often impossible to visit
Oil and water aren’t the only things that play nice under extreme pressures, though
The noble gases do, too
Normally, atoms react with each other to get a full outer shell of electrons, because that’s when they’re the most stable
Noble gases are elements that already have that shell filled, so unless they lose an electron, they don’t need to interact with anything — and it’s very hard to force them to
Still, compounds with noble gases in them can be useful, like for removing the electrons from an atom
Last night the ABC’s Four Corners ran a story on people’s experiences with commercial lending.
To clarify: ASIC does not regulate commercial lending arrangements under Australia's consumer credit protection laws.
Unlike consumer credit providers, commercial lenders don't have to be licensed to provide or arrange finance.
They are not subject to detailed conduct or disclosure regulation.
And they don't have to be members of an ombudsman scheme.
Sometimes though, we are called on to get involved in private disputes involving commercial loans.
We will assess them - as we do with all information provided to us - but generally we won't take action on what are essentially private, commercial disputes.
Sometimes it is more appropriate for the police to get involved if there are allegations of criminal conduct such as theft, fraud or intimidation.
Borrowers need to be level-headed in these situations.
Hello I'm Meditated, and I'm Liberated, and we're so excited to announce the world premiere meditated and liberated January 17th to the 21st in San Diego! And we've been working on this for quite a while
Libby and I have been teaching and sharing for more than 10 years together, traveling the world sharing some of our signature processes
And so, maybe you could share a little bit with our viewers what will be, where we'll be going and what they can expect
Well Meditated &amp; Liberated really has been a culmination of so much life experience and really is the wisdom that we've been able to take as a result and I think if I look at Meditated &amp; Liberated in the way of what is it it's I know so many people that are aware of where their stuff in their lives but they just don't know how to get unstuck
So awareness is one thing, acting on that awareness is transformation, and that's exactly what will happen for you
So, there's many different ways for us to move beyond: it's meditation, it's movement, it's self-inquiry, it's process, it's all of the things which are great, but when we do them in a community, which we're really wonderful at creating that sacred community, anything to be achieved, so we are looking forward to that being exactly what your experience is like at the very first event in January
I think at this point, it is important to understand a bit of the Keynesian Model.
In the Keynesian model, I and G are autonomous, that is, they are independent of income.
Retirement is an important time in anyones life to make sure that they have enough money for their current needs.
Amongst fixed investments and various other investments that may be tied up, it is important to have liquidity for current emergencies.
This is where money market mutual funds and money market actual funds are beneficial to the retiree.
You can start accumulating these early in life and the account balances can be quite large.

What do Zika and dengue and malaria and all those strange and scary diseases we hear about on the news these days have in common
They're all spread by mosquitoes, and mosquito ranges are often determined by climate
In some cases, a disease could move out of its current region if it gets too hot, like dengue in the summer here in West Texas
In other cases, a disease could move into a new region, where it was previously unknown, like Lyme disease in Canada
We share this planet with seven and a half billion people, a number that will hit nine billion by the middle of this century
We've divided up our land

We've assumed that our climate is stable
Hi, I am Stefan Gerber and I am the instructor of the course Earth System Analysis
When we are talking about a system, we typically mean that there are many pieces that work together
An example of a system is the human body where a multitude of cells clustered in organs are connected to each other to become who we are
We can look at the Earth System in the same way
Multiple pieces are interacting with each other to become the blue planet that we know
There is atmospheric circulation that redistributes the energy from the sun, so that life can inhabit almost every nook and cranny of the Earth surface
There is the ocean who is an important regulator of climate and the cradle of life
There is life itself, that profoundly changed the Earth, where bare rocks are now topped with soils, forests and grasslands
In this course, when we talk about how life changed the Earth, we will also address how humans have contributed to this change
We are now tapping energy resources that took millions of years to build and in the process add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere
In this course, we will address how industrialization impacts our Earth system
We will track carbon dioxide after it leaves smokestacks, and follow the molecules as they cycle through atmosphere, biosphere, soils and ocean
We will analyze how the sun, volcanoes and greenhouse gases affect climate
We will explore the role of the ocean in absorbing some of the current climate change
We will do that using modeling tools
Graduate students, you will build an Earth system model that allows you to explore climate change paths
All of us will learn how to use simple physical and biological concepts to get a better grasp of the Earth system and to gain insights into the wicked problem of environmental change
The course is close to my heart
I am a biogeochemist and I study the global cycles of carbon and nitrogen and my research addresses some of the questions we will be discussing in this course
I came to the University of Florida in 2011
Most of my research here revolves around computer modeling of the global biosphere, and a central question my lab is trying to answer is how much greenhouse gases we emit into the atmosphere is being soaked up by vegetation and soils

Hi I'm Steve Dimopoulos and I'm here at Victorian Parliament House.
We've had a great week this week – for Victoria but also for our local community.
We saw the announcement of the biggest single investment into elective surgery waiting lists in Australia's history – $335 million dollars, which will see 18,000 more surgeries take place this year as opposed to last year, including at Monash Health.
Secondly, we saw the Premier, Daniel Andrews, announce $572 million dollars to implement the 65 most important, or most urgent, recommendations from the Royal Commission into Family Violence – a really important area.
More safety for women and children – the biggest, again, investment in family violence prevention.
Our community action agency has been working in southeast Kansas for 42 years.
Each year we recognize our staff and volunteers and community partners.
And each year we bring in a special guest to work with us and help motivate our staff.
This year we had the pleasure of having John Pullum with us.
And I cannot begin to tell you how extraordinary this man was.
And the grand entertainment he provided to our staff.
But not only fun entertainment engaging all out staff, but he motivated them as well.
He would weave a message of hope for our staff and the families that we serve into his unique blend of humor and entertainment.

Now, I think because it could be measured.
But I'm also fond of saying that not everything that can be measured matters, and so it is with a click.
Over 90% of businesses want to see a cultural shift in the way they comply with regulations, such as those governing privacy and data protection, from 'doing what they must' to 'doing the right thing'. This from a new study from Deloitte.
I'm Megan Edwards for InvestmentPitch.com Investment firm Canaccord Genuity has updated its buy recommendation on TearLab Corporation, which trades on NASDAQ under the symbol "TEAR" and on the Toronto Stock Exchange, under the symbol "TLB". Analyst Jeffrey Frelick gives the company a buy rating and raised the one-year price target from $10.00 to $14.00 US, a 46% premium to the $9.56 US price the day the report was issued.
TearLab has commercialized a proprietary tear testing platform, the TearLab Osmolarity System, that enables eye care practitioners to test for highly sensitive and specific biomarkers using nanoliters of tear film at the point of care.
Their first product measures tear film osmolarity for the diagnosis of dry eye disease.
Experts anticipate that dry Eye Syndrome will be the most prevalent eye disorder the Baby Boomer generation faces in the future.
Canaccord recently conducted interviews of TearLab users and found high levels of satisfaction from its customers.
As a result, analyst Jeffrey Frelick stated, "We gained comfort with our near-term assumptions and increased our instrument placements and utilization rates in 2015, resulting in raising our revenue expectations to $70 million from $65 million." The shares are currently trading at $10.00 US, and with 29 million shares outstanding, the company is capitalized at $290 million.
As we stated, this $10.00 price is well below Canaccord Genuity's target price of $14.00. Canaccord cautions that investment risks would include lag time for CIJA waiver certificates, slow uptake by physicians, reimbursement risk, and other medical technology risks.
For more information, please visit the company's website www.TeaerLab.com or contact Stephen Kilmer at 647-872-4849 or email skilmer@tearlab.com.

Hey guys, Bridget from Money After Graduation here and I wanted to answer a common question I hear all the time and that's, what are dividends and how do I get them? Dividend investing is one of my favorite ways to invest in the stock market and it's one of my strongest passive income streams that I have coming into my wealth portfolio
I love being a dividend investor and I think dividend paying stocks and ETFs are an essential in every Millennial's portfolio
To understand what a dividend is, you really just have to understand what it means to be a shareholder of a company
When you buy stock in a company, you're essentially becoming a part owner of that company
You're giving them your money in exchange for a piece of their company
Because you're now a part owner of the business, you're entitled to some of the rights and privileges of being an owner in the business and that includes the profit
So dividends are usually a cash distribution that's paid quarterly or sometimes monthly to shareholders in a company
You don't have to do anything, all you need to do is purchase the stock before the ex-dividend date and then you will receive your payout proportional to the number of shares you own on the dividend payout date
This is what makes dividend investing so attractive and so easy it's because it really is passive income
All you need to do is own the stock, and you don't need to take any action after that
The money is automatically deposited into your brokerage account, then you can use it to buy more shares in the same company, buy shares in another company, or to withdraw and spend it
One of the things that makes dividend investing so attractive is companies often raise their dividends every year, typically by 10% to 15%
This means the longer you own a stock, the more you're making on your original investment
Most stocks will pay dividends in the range of about 1% to 3%, but you can definitely get stocks that pay seven, eight, or even double-digit dividend rates
It's important to remember when you're chasing these dividends that rate reflects risk
So high dividend payers are usually riskier stocks
Nevertheless, owning a mix and a diversity of low dividend payers and high dividend payers because you have low and higher risk stocks in your portfolio is a great way to diversify your investments and increase your overall passive income
Like with all investing, there are associated risks, the main one of dividend investing being that the company could reduce or even eliminate its dividend entirely
Now this is extremely rare because it makes shareholders mad if you stop paying them, so a company will only cut or eliminate its dividend is it's facing dire financial straits
Otherwise shareholders are the most important people to a corporation so they will go to great lengths to continue to pay that dividend, pay it on time and increase it year over year
If you guys are interested in dividend investing or investing in general you know I teach a course called The Six-Figure Stock Portfolio, I'll leave a link below if you want to check it out
Otherwise I hope you found this video informative and feel more comfortable understanding what dividends are and how they work in the stock market and why they can do so much for you
Deloitte has announced its plans to invest $750 million in strategic markets over the next three years.
The investment will continue its previous investment of $500 million in strategic markets from 2010 to 2012. The investment will be focused on 11 national and regional markets that the firm has targeted for future expansion.
Now, what Janet does for these online courses is she solicits questions from her students and emails them over to me and that's what I have here on my handy.
dandy phone.
And so, we're just going to jump in to some of the questions.
First questions was, once you start podcasting, what are the ways to promote them?
-- to promote podcasts?
Well, the fact is, podcasts are best promoted, of course, online.
Because ou can link people right over to whatever show you've created.
CATHARINE FINDIESEN HAYS: The project started about a year and a half ago within the SEI Center of Advanced Studies in Management, which is part of the Wharton school.
And it is really the mission of that initiative within the Wharton school to see what's changing, what's new, what's breaking, what's hot in the whole field of business management.
And this really just bubbled to the top.
Now let's talk about visual aides.
Did the speaker use visual aides and did he use them or she use them correctly?

and not having the massive houses, and you'll see that many times over and over if you would go and search out YouTube, or other videos that are dealing with information on housing is that we have built our communities really with three, four bedroom ramblers and as we're having the aging population, no longer do we need a three or four bedroom rambler
I love that research that shows that when you empower women in a country the situation in the country get better and that the countries that are the least free, and frankly the most dangerous are the countries that oppress the women, that keep their women down, that don't educate their women.
Money really speaks too, and the fact that when you educate girls, when you help them go further in their careers that is actually very beneficial to the country, the bottom line of the country.
And in terms of America, I think it's actually , it's really interesting, that the girls who come to our program tend to be the girls from low income, underprivileged communities, and I think that the reason why we get those girls is if you are living in a community that is just rife with problems and you don't see anyone working to solve those problems, you know some of these young girls, even at the age of 14 are saying: nobody's working to solve these problems and somebody needs to step up and maybe it should be me.
So we get those girls who come in and they are hungry to change things in their community and they want to get that power to get people to listen to them, to really craft a message that will get people to help them and further their ideas.
Hi everybody Dave Sullivan for the Credit Guy TV this week I want to do a quick little review on Credit Karma K A R M A they have a website they have set up giving away free credit scores and I went thought the process I checked it out fairly simple to sign up I like the fact that I did not have to put in my full social to get the information and it is all free, the problem is that it gave me a trans risk score with has no relevance to the FICO score but it just so happens to have the same range 300 to 850 and then it has a vantage and auto insurance score.
and those scores are OK to look at and they are free but you should not get a false sense of security thinking that you know your FICO score it is going to very a little bit, but if you know what the ranges are for the other scores it may be a great way for you to check it out.
I am not big on that but I did like the portion in here the credit simulator I really liked how the credit simulator where you could add different things on your credit report and then find out what the score would be now again it will not be the same results as the FICO score but I liked the ability to play around with this it is a great way to learn it is really based on your credit score now the credit bureaus like the one I work at have had this tools for a long time for the loan officers they have had been able to do this go in and make corrections and see what the score would be really play with the model but the result was much closer to FICO than these are so you are just trying to learn and kind of test things out now there will be adds all over this site don't pay for anything but go in and I would defiantly do it and go in and play with the credit score simulator just so you can better lean about ways to improve your specific credit report it really is nice in that way.
I am going to go a head and recommend it provided that you don't buy anything I don't know how long this will last because as more and more people come in to it and they don't charge anything for it they are ether going to have to charge or do something to raise money I don't think the revenue created will support it.

The family of poets that we have here in Colombia-- it's unbelievable
The drive, the people that encouraged me to keep on going
Everyone gets together and we spill our souls
You know, we give each other encouragement
And it's one family of just amazing, creative talent
We try to encourage our younger poets to come in, because we know that we're getting to that age where we're not going to be able to go out and do it, but we want them to constantly keep uplifting other poets, other artists, other students, other people, just to kind of keep doing what we do
MICHAEL JONES: The advice that I would give retailers going into the holiday season would be, I would be cautiously optimistic.
I believe that most retailers actually are.
I do believe that there will be some spending online.
The bottom line is that most people as it relates to the holiday season tend to want to have a good holiday for their families and-- So I do believe there will be spending.
I don't think it will be as crazy as they have been in the past.
Okay, I'm Anne Lezak, and you ask "How do you run for local office?" I actually have a lot of experience, none running for local office myself.
Hello, it's Alex!
Today I am going to talk about religion, and specifically, I am going to talk about a distinction that I think is often glossed over when people talk about religion, and that is the distinction between the official organizational stance of some type of organized religion, like Catholicism or like a specific Protestant denomination, like the United Methodist Church or any organization, so a distinction between the official organizational stance, and what people actually believe, which may or may not correspond to that.
In some cases, like in the case of Catholicism, the official stance is that everyone is "supposed to" believe what the official organizational stance is.
But I know a lot of people who identify as Catholics, and from talking to a lot of them, I know that many of them don't actually believe all the things that the church says they are "supposed to" believe.
I've had some interesting conversations too between people of different religious backgrounds, and I've sometimes been surprised that people's beliefs sometimes deviate from their official stances in unexpected ways.
One example, I've heard the comparison between Catholics and Protestants, I've heard the statement that Catholics believe in transubstantiation, which means that when they take communion, the bread and wine actually becomes the body and blood of Christ, whereas Protestants "don't" believe in transubstantiation, they believe that it's more of a symbolic meaning when they take communion.
If you want to learn more about cosmetic and natural preservatives
This is video for you Hi my name is Zane and I'm from Atlantis Skincare
In this video I want to talk about water containing cosmetic products
Basically, all the products containing water should require preservatives
Why? Because water is very good environment for bacteria, molds and fungi to grow
And without preservation it happens very very fast if you don't like preservatives at all, I would recommend you to learn how to make your own cosmetic products
But you should make them in a very small batches and keep in a fridge for maximum seven days
Or you can watch another video about products without water and you will understand how you can use these skills to make your own products but if you're using products containing water, and you're buying them in the shops they definitely contain preservatives
In a market at the moment it is some more natural solutions for preservatives and most of them are even equal and organically certified
Only thing you should learn to read labels again
In next videos I will share with you some more natural preservative options, and you can learn how to find them in a regent list and understand are they really in a product
So, I'm looking forward to meeting you and please watch another video about products without water
Can you imagine the implications of a woman having an abortion right up until the due date
I have suffered a miscarriage, I've had an abortion, and I'm actually a mother of a six-year-old daughter who last night the teacher said to me, "Your daughter is extraordinary
I have never had a student in my class as intelligent as your daughter
" From a miscarriage, from an abortion, and from having a child I can tell you there is only one that has liberated me as a woman, and that is being a mother
No one told me
the polling both nationally and in the states
And so, you know, in that sense, don't upset the apple cart, don't do something that would - you know, would refocus attention on your own problems, and keep it on Donald Trump
I think for her there's a couple of questions
One is, the first debate she clearly had a strategy to get under his skin and was very successful at it
It was less clear what her strategy was in the second debate
Our facial expressions, to some extent reveal what we are thinking and feeling, it reveals our heart condition.
But people can easily misjudge also facial expressions; they may misjudge all of it.
But let me tell you, if someone is frowning at what God approves of, they heart is NOT right with Jesus.
But vise-versa, if they are smiling at what God hates and detests their heart ALSO is against God and they are anti-Christ.
Our hearts must align with the Holy Spirit.
People have accused me of not having the joy of Jesus because they THINK that Christians should always be smiling.
This is a lie.
IF you are carrying your cross, then you are NOT smiling but you are diligently carrying your cross.
People have also accused me of laughing or smiling saying that I am prideful and I make fun of others who are in sin, this is also a lie.
Okay, I'm going to show you a sample monologue, which when you go to do your monologue, you simply have to introduce the title and the author.
You don't need to go into any description about the monologue or the character, and this is a monologue from "The Wool Gatherer, by William Mastrosimone.
You may think it's funny, but I was the last one to see them alive.
There were only seven of them in the world, and the zoo had four of them.
I used to go there every night just to watch them standing so still in the water, and they moved so graceful in slow motion, and the their legs were as skinny as my little finger; long legs, and there were only seven of them in the world, because they killed them all for feathers for ladies hats or something.
Hi I'm Richard Cordray, chief of enforcement as we stand up the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
We have our first suggestion on the website, from Fernando, who points out that state attorneys general also enforce laws that protect consumers across the country.
I'm well aware of that, being a former Attorney General myself from Ohio.
We will be looking to work very closely with the state attorneys general, we regard ourselves as part of the same team.
I think what advertisers need to do to be successful in 2010 and afterwards is really think about a cross platform strategy and how these things happen synchronously or simultaneously with one another.
I'd like to introduce you to the Sun Oven, this is part of our series on sun oven cooking essentials, and I'm just going to cover all the basics of everything you want to know about a Sun Oven, maybe a whole lot of things you don't want to know
This is a Sun Oven, it folds up it carries like a suitcase and only weighs 21 pounds
Hello folks and welcome to sociology 1, I am your professor Elizabeth Ortega.
Hopefully all of you have already received a welcome letter to your e-mail, which gave you some basic descriptions about the course, but just like any other class, I will also provide with a detailed syllabus that will let you know about assignments activities, and due dates.
Information about how to access the course syllabus is located directly below in the "getting started" section.
By now I'm pretty sure that you have also noticed that online courses are a little bit different from face to face courses.
For one you do not go to a physical class to learn, or to listen to your professor lecture, instead you will attend a virtual class--at your own pace--where each of you will be working on weekly modules.
Each module addresses a different chapter in the book depending on the week.
For instance, another of Kubzansky's studies found that optimism is associated with lower levels of inflammation
If what you mean by happiness is specifically "enjoyment of life," there's newer evidence to support that, too
A study in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that people ages 60 and older who said they enjoyed life less were more likely to develop disability over an eight-year period
Mobility was also related to enjoyment of life
This study does not prove that physical problems are caused by less enjoyment of life, but suggests a relationship
Where happiness comes from: genes plus environment
Hey guys this is Dave Vass, I'm from Calgary.
I just wanted to do a quick video and tell you about a basement development company here called Planit Builders.
Now I don't I work for them, so I'm now an employee of their company or anything like this, this is an honest review for this company.
I know the owners of the company, I've met them a few different times, I've dealt with the company and I think it's a fantastic company.
Umm... they are, they definitely are a head of the game when it comes to basement development and basement renovations and the reason for it is because they specialize in basements.
So people ask me "What are dreams?" Well what are dreams?
Dreams are the self telling us about our self.
It's said that in the Egyptian Pyramids there's hieroglyphs all along one of the walls.
So you can read the story all along the wall, but in fact you're only reading half the story.
To get to the other half you have to walk all the way around to the other side of the wall where the rest of the story is written.
frankly the magnitude or nature of those problems between these two groups
You could not even distinguish which group they were in based on that metric

When I came home from this conference I shared this with my wife

Is that what you learned in two days Paul

"To my mind it appears that the difficulty is only imaginary and not real
Rigidity and plasticity are not absolute terms, but relative, and all solids are in fact both rigid and plastic
When great masses and great forces are involved

" Sometimes the rigid definitions we create for ourselves can introduce misconceptions, or viscous rumors, like the idea that the core of the Earth is a giant ball of magma
If only we could think about liquids and solids a little bit more




While we're on the subject of franchises that may have already peaked, we've also got the official word that a new Gran Turismo game is coming out

I'm sure five of you will tell me in the comments that you do
Polyphony and Sony announced over the weekend that Gran Turismo Sport will make its debut later this year, on November 15th, 2016


Hi, I'm Dr. Karla Kennedy-Hagan from the School of Family and Consumer Sciences.
My role in Family and Consumer Sciences is that I serve as the assistant chair as well as coordinator for the dietetic internship program.
The research project that I'm working on right now is kind of comparing the old method that I used to the new method and doing a little bit of action research here within my own area.
But I really feel like my past portfolio was very traditional.
And that the students did the different assignments.
They developed instruments that they use.
And much of that was nutrition education since that's what our focus is for our internship program.
And so they've created materials.
They went out and did wonderful presentations.
The banks are--and it's worth taking this in slowly--HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS AG, and the Bank of America

hi I'm Zach with Screenflex here to talk about the pricing of our room dividers I room dividers range from five hundred and sixty six dollars to 2040 dollars Our prices are not shown online because there are a variety of factors including the pricing of your specific room divider.
Those factors include fabric, model, height and length for your application.

I just want to talk to you real briefly about the Puerto Rican bond situation.
It seems that hedge fund professionals, professional investors are no investing in puerto rican debt that the prices are so depressed that these investors now feel like there is a significant upside to investing in Puerto Rican debt and they are willing to make the bet that Puerto Rico will make a significant comeback.
That's good news for Puerto Rico, however, many retail investors who had previously invested in Puerto Rican debt ended up having their portfolios wiped out because these financial advisors would put these conservative portfolios into a leveraged position and in some cases multiple leveraged or margined positions, which means they were borrowing a lot of money to invest in Puerto Rican debt.
And when the bond prices went down, these loans were effectively called in, and these portfolios of these retail investors were wiped out.
John: The economic crisis is becoming such a crisis of actions now not taken, for employment and the creation of equality in employment the center of the agenda on economic policy internationally.
In short that means government need to focus on ensuring that the recovery translates more quickly into employment creation.

I see this phrase and hear this phrase all over the place

Hi, I'm Mike Campbell, with Doggie Styles, in Beverly Hills, and I'm here to talk about forecasting retail sales.
Forecasting sales can be very, very difficult, especially, if it's a tough economic time.
We're in a recession right now.
Starting a business is difficult, right?
According to new analysis by PwC comparing shares of world GDP for key global country groupings in 1992, 2012 and 2032, dramatic shifts in global economic power pose sustainability challenges for Rio + 20 and beyond.
Emerging and developing economies could account for 63% of world GDP by 2032, which will also be reflected in their increasingly dominant role in global demand for energy and other finite natural resources.
As GUE/NGL we consider that the selections of Mr. Juncker's candidates for Commission positions have proved deficient and mistaken The failure of Ms. Bratusek to be approved by the Industry,   Research and Energy Committee and the Environment Committee as Vice-president reflected her inadequate performance in the hearings;  she has not clarified her position on the issues relating to the Energy Union We furthermore consider that the approval with a narrow majority of Mr. Cañete as Commissioner  for Energy and Climate shows that there was a major dissatisfaction among the Committees.
His endorsement by the majority was a result of conciliation between the EPP and S &amp; D groups.
This is Ron Paul with your weekly update for Our foreign policy was in the spotlight last week, which is exactly where it should be.
Dr. Barrett: At Kessler Foundation, it’s great that hidden disabilities after stroke are recognized to have a number of different areas of impact, not only on the individual and how he or she can be free in their life and function and daily activities but also how that person experiences recovery in the hospital setting and afterwards in the transition into the community.
Now our medical system, our national medical system, is setting up indexes to look at quality for medical care and I’m very pleased that the American Academy of Neurology has nominated me to take part on the steering committee on the National Quality Forum.
Hi, I'm Kate Kotzea and I'm here to talk about marketing technology, or MarTech and why it's important
First, you might be asking what is MarTech? Well, it's when marketing and technology come together to help us automate processes, to help us aggregate data to look at the business, and to really start to understand that customer experience from the first touchpoint to the last
We want to talk through four reasons why MarTech is important
The first, is that MarTech really puts a priority on systems integrations or MarTech stacks
What's a MarTech stack? It's when you can visually represent and categorize all of the different marketing technology platforms your company uses
You really start seeing where things are integrated, and where there are holes
The second reason is that MarTech really looks at the whole customer journey
So from that first touchpoint to the last, how are customers experiencing your brand? By having integrated platforms, we're able to create smarter, and more strategic and personalized campaigns
So it's that right message, at the right time
From strategic media placements and dynamic content, to the sales process and marketing automation, we're able to unify that marketing message
The third reason is that marketing connect the dots between marketing and operations
Finally those that are selling the business promises and those that are executing on the business promises are looking at the same data, the same business goals, and are really able to create more unified business decisions to help them reach those
The fourth reason, is that MarTech lets you market smarter
By having all of these platforms integrated, we're able to see where we can automate processes to help streamline and create efficiencies
Since everything is integrated, we can adopt processes faster, adopt trends faster, and scale those marketing efforts to get to market faster
Ultimately, instead of aggregating all this data we're able to spend time strategically looking at the data and making business decisions that can really impact the bottom line
Hello my name is Lucy and I want to make this video about Betterment.
Betterment is a really great website.
It's a new way to invest - they assess the risks and the advantages and they make investing so much easier especially if you have limited experience.
You can do everything online and you don't have to work with a stockbroker or anything like that and it's just a really great way to get anybody to invest.
My name is Pat Iyer.
I started a successful Legal Nurse Consulting Business in 1989. I mentor nurses who want to become Legal Nurse Consultants.
I have been blogging since 2009. This is a tip for you if you are a Legal Nurse Consultant.
First you absolutely need a website if you are a independent Legal Nurse Consultant.
How are attorneys going to find you if you don't have a website?
Websites with blogs pack a powerful punch.
Do I have your attention?
You'd like to start a blog for your Legal Nurse Consulting wesbsite or you already have a blog and you want to be trying different types of posts and different approaches.
Consider telling a story.
We have been conditioned since we were children to settle down to hear a story.
We're talking about the evaluation of the speaker and their overall presentation, and a couple of things that you want to take a look for.
First is posture, and when I'm talking about posture, this is what I see a lot.
It is our desire as the owners of this company to do everything we possibly can in terms of helping strengthen the families.
Of course, closing on Sundays - real important to us, giving our managers a five day work week is very important to us, closing at 8:00 instead of 9:00 so maybe a parent can tuck their kids in bed before they go to bed at night.
Probably the word I would use for that is integrity.
ASSISTANT SECRETARY THOMAS-GREENFIELD: We are monitoring that situation very closely and we're working very closely with all our partners including the French, the United Nations, and regional organizations to address the growing insecurity that is taking place in that country.
We are a multi-agency team and the reason we came in this format is because the security problems that exist in Northern Nigeria and in many places in the world are multifaceted and they can't always be dealt with from a security perspective only.
Hey guys, this just an update video to explain my absence in the past month.
I know it's been awhile since I uploaded a video, and I left you all with nothing after starting Undertale and Tales of Zestiria, but I do plan on getting back into those games.
I had a difficult technical problem where my computer was not rendering the video completely before completely shutting down.
See currently, I have a store purchased PC that, which comes to no surprise, does not have very amazing capability when it comes to recording and/or rendering large files.
I was  so excited to start recording and get videos out to you guys, and then I felt all of that  energy vanish overnight, and I got pretty down and just became a major introvert.
However, a fellow YouTuber named FuryForged was discussing things with me and mentioned another video editing software that isn't so intensive on a computer, so I gave it a try and it works!
I saw it standing there (the bicycle) and i thought by myself what is happening here?
I said: 'This isn't my bike' And then a friend of ours,  who was standing there, said 'that's my bike'. Then i said:  'How is it possible that it's standing there?' I didn't know what to do and I didn't know what was going on.
My name is Jill Weiss, and I'm going to tell you a few tips, on how to run a youth softball practice.
First thing you want to consider is, depending on the seriousness, the competitiveness, of the team you're coaching, whether they are just beginning athletes, or they're twelve, fourteen, and under, pretty competitive traveling team.
So, when I started in marketing, I did this.
Because I was a creative guy.
And here I am today, I think I'm really more of a marketing scientist.
And I think my team probably comprises more of scientific numbers people than it does pure creative people.

Hi everybody, I’m Bill Schuette Michigan’s Attorney General.
Welcome to the Michigan Cyber Safety Initiative or Michigan CSI this Community Seminar.
Thanks for giving my team and giving me the opportunity to share helpful tips to keep your family safe.
You know my wife Cynthia and I are the parents of two children and we understand that everyone wants to be connected and we recognize that today’s children are part of this digital generation and they’ve grown up with computers and smart phones and tablets and all sorts of devices.
And while the web offers countless advantages, you know dangerous or explicit materials are only a click away.
If you click on a bad link on a website it’s like taking a wrong turn in a bad part of town.
Predators lurk everywhere on the internet and that’s why it is important, so important to make sure we know what our children are doing online.
This Community Seminar covers the online dangers that most frequently threaten today’s students and it’ll provide you with practical tools and safety tips.
You’ll also hear about the topics we covered in Michigan CSI student presentations and how we’ve encouraged your student to talk with you about anything and I mean anything that makes them uncomfortable.
My team will also provide you with information about the OK2SAY program which is Michigan’s brand new school safety initiative and what ok means for students so that we can report any behavior that threatens their safety or the safety of others.
I’m confident you’ll find this Community Seminar information useful and I’d encourage you to go to my website at michigan.gov/ag for more resources.

I'm Carolyn Tomin the BU financial planning program director
You may be wondering what our faculty is looking for when we review and grade your capstone presentations So let me give you some ideas of what you can expect

We'll be noticing how well you interact with your clients and noting your ability to communicate with them
We also want to see how well you can educate them about concepts that they may not know
Another thing we're going to be looking for is how well you have organized your presentation
Does it flow well? Are you discussing all of the subject areas that pertain to your clients financial situation
Did you wrap up the meeting with an action plan that identifies the steps and the timeframes needed to implement your planning recommendations
We find that if you follow the template that we have provided for you you will include all of the elements for presenting a comprehensive financial plan
Hi, my name’s Harriette, I’m a third year Sociology with Criminology student.
I picked Kingston because I wanted to be near London but I didn’t want to quite be with all the hustle and bustle and when I came to see the campus I felt right walking around.
Corporate and securities law helps businesses of every size.
It helps them from the inception of the business... and throughout the entire lifetime of the business.
From tax issues to real estate, contracts, intellectual property... really, it's counseling for the business in the entire life cycle.
Oftentimes, when starting a business... you'll need to work on how you're actually going to structure the corporation... and so it will be your job to divvy up the tasks among everyone... and make sure that each person's voice is actually heard... when you're forming the corporation.
Every size business needs a corporate attorney.
You might work with a small business that, after it's been launched... it ends up wanting to form another subsidiary entity.
Land is the most important resource for sustainable production
It's essential for sustainable development that the land governance and land rights are clear, and then people in the society knows that they have equitable rights
What can be done to secure land rights for the poor and vulnerable populations
One important step is to improve land administration by developing modern and effective systems to protect, record, adjudicate, and register property rights
Pakistan is setting a good example of this with the help of digital technology
In Punjab, the countrys most populous province, the Land Records Management and Information Systems Project has transformed rural land titling
The program has digitized land records and created data centers
This is financial adviser Patrick Munro, talking about, how home improvement loans for bad credit work.
Real estate is a good risk to a financial institution, if the numbers are right.
Many individuals have had difficult credit situations, whereby on their own, without backing real estate, they would not be a good credit risk to a bank, and could not in fact get any money.
Hi Everyone, I'm Asma, chairperson of EMRO region and i would like to wish you all a happy new year عالسلامه!

and although it sounds kind of geeky, the main way of representing those models is through representation called YANG


and the desegregation of the buses
Which of course, became very real in my own life, as I got older and rode the buses in Mobile myself
In addition to that, I think back over my own parents
My father who was born and raised in New Orleans and who would not have had access to higher education had it not be for his father's ability to take care of transportation needs
And get him ultimately to Howard University here in Washington for dental school
All of this is wrapped up in this ability to get around
So in my own experience, as much as every day I advocate for persons with disabilities and persons with language issues, with not speaking English
All of those things we fight for in rules and regulations in the Department of Transportation
Customers are busy.
We’re all busy people.
The-- we’re bombarded with information.
Ive been asking for you guys the subscribers and fans of this channel to send me your videos and I want to use them in this video as a way of shouting out to you guys and also as a bit of fan appreciation as without you the channel would be nothing
Why we chose UNC Charlotte? My director of HR and is an alum from here and also UNC charlotte is just a great school and has a lot of different candidates that we can choose from, so we're always looking for diverse individuals that are looking for a Sales opportunity
It's really important to recruit young talent because they're motivated, they want to work
One of the future of our company
You've gotta start somewhere
You want someone, at this level, that's obviously interested in these career fairs, someone that's not interested is not gonna be here
So we're super excited to be here and to be in front of all these students that are ready to get out there and work hard
That's the biggest thing that I think that we look for
It's just somebody that's going to come in and work hard no matter what they're going to do
But I'm here at on UNCC
I've been coming, I think this is my fifth year, doing this fair
They do, y'all do a great job
You're very supportive of the vendors which I love, not all the campuses are
[laughs] and I get a good mix of students from a variety of majors and backgrounds
I've had Business majors, Psychology majors, Social Work majors, just to name a few from this school and they've all been excellent staff and and I really appreciate the effort that y'all put into this and the quality of the students I get
We have an office here in Charlotte in addition to eight others in North Carolina and in the Charlotte market, we know that UNC Charlotte provides great programs that are relevant to what we're looking for, so coming here gives us the exposure and the access to these students to catch them before they graduate! We really like UNCC's career fairs we've been coming for the last, probably, I don't know, four years - as long as I've been with the organization
You get a good broad base of different areas so I feel like we've recruited some individuals from here so it's from the fair so it's been really really nice
We have a tremendous relationship with UNC Charlotte and the majority of our interns actually come from UNC, so we look at this as an opportunity to bring people onto our organization, developing train


give our interns an opportunity to see our business and industry from the inside
And then after graduation, It's our intention to promote these people into full-time staff
So it's really a culture of 100% promotion from within it's a great jump off opportunity to start a career
Hey everyone!
Dana here and today I have lots of exciting, crazy things to share with you.
First of all, last week we hit 10,000 subscribers.
10,000! That's crazy and amazing and I'm just so happy and overwhelmed and excited to make more videos.
And to say thank you for helping me reach this awesome goal, I will be doing a few things.
For one, a giveaway.
As you might have noticed behind me, we’ve got a new background with all new clocks.
So, hmmm, what should we do with the old clocks?
Well, I've decided to give them to you!
So in the next few videos, I will be giving away four of the clocks from the old background.
The grizzly bear clock, the record clock, the time clock, and this clock back here that I made by hand by rolling up pages out of German magazines.
And today we’ll also be giving something away, but it’s not a clock.
It’s a Wanted Adventure bag.
One of a kind and first of its kind.
As a hobby, my mom like to sew and knit and make quilts and other cool stuff like that, and for 10,000 subscribers she made me this awesome Wanted Adventure bag to give away.
An Actuary is a professional who does calculations involving financial contingent events.
What that means is that, economic condition change and when something happens with the probability, the financial effect that they have will be different.
The start of a new academic year provides an opportune moment to reflect on where we are as a college community - where we have been and where we’re headed.
The probation sanction and intense work on the self-study served as reminders of the importance of understanding the past for creating a better future.
While some of Pima College’s past reveals tremendous accomplishment, other parts of its past are painful.
To build on the accomplishments we have to acknowledge the harms of the past and learn from them.
A critical chapter of the College’s past occurred when eight women employed at the College had the courage to come forward and report sexual harassment and retaliation by the former chancellor.
These women were willing to face him directly with an independent investigator.
Rather than do so, he resigned more than a year before the end date of his contract.
Reporting sexual misconduct demonstrated real courage.
There is great risk to the victim in making the report.
There is no guarantee what the reaction will be, whether there will be retaliation or how the person will be perceived by others.
The harm from abuse by a person in power and from the stigma that often comes with reporting is real even though the person reporting has done nothing wrong.
A bodyguard is an executive protection agent, in today's terms.
An executive protection agent is a person that protects another individual, the site, the estate, location, assets, personal property, and is assigned to do so as a member of a, usually as a member of a team.
Well, essentially the aspects of executive protection work involve a multitude of phases or core operations.
STEVE HOCH: How does a retailer brand advertise?
Well, virtually none of them do.
What can you do?
You can take out newspaper advertising.
You can take out magazine advertising.
But most advertising that retailers do is of this, here's what I've got, here's the price, here's when it's on sale, come and get it.
Welcome to OptionRally news and our weekly market event update
The big market event this week will be the Non-Manufacturing purchasing manager's index
This week it's all about the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI
This data is released on a monthly basis and measures the Level of a diffusion index based on surveyed purchasing managers, excluding the manufacturing industry in the United States
If the report is Above 50 it indicates industry expansion, and below indicates contraction
This index is based on surveys of more than 400 non-manufacturing purchasing managers, within 60 sectors across the United States, by the Institute of Supply Management
The last index that was released in January registered 53 percent

This indicator is gaining more and more attention with every release, providing insight into business areas that are not well covered in other indicators

"Evolving Insurance Regulation: Time to get ahead" is a new report where KPMG provides an overview of global and local Asia Pacific insurance regulatory trends.

Well I think with the new channels of distribution, the digital channels, it’s that there’s inherently communication mechanisms that live there.
So there are two way communication mechanisms, so that if the advertiser reaches the consumer, they can actually have a conversation, versus if something is happening on a linear or a theatrical experience, say television or radio, there’s not that two way mechanism for them to interact and that has to then take place on the consumer’s initiative at a later point in time.

When you file a car accident claim you can be assured that the insurance company and their lawyers are going to check your cell phone records, your text message records, and they do this because if the crash happened at two o'clock they're going to look at your cell phone and your text message records and see if you were talking on the phone or if you were sending a text message at two o'clock

hey guys its crystal I help people get free devices for their hearing loss and this video is specifically for veterans and veteran service officers so if you know anybody who could benefit please share this information with them it's very helpful if they have hearing loss i know a lot of veterans get their hearing aids through the VA this is another program you can use and you can go to the VA and get this device at no cost so what this is I'll tell you about the what the actual devices and then how you can take it to either your VSO or your VA and get the phone so it's a phone that's amplified and it writes out word-for-word what's being said so some folks use it heavily they use the captions heavily they hardly even listen to what's being said on the phone they read most of what's being said and others use it as a backup so some people just have some trouble with a couple syllables they have certain trouble with certain voices and so they like having the words come up so that they know what's being said for sure and CapTel makes this phone to caption telephone and they work very very well and there it's very helpful the only thing you need to do is go to your VA or your veteran's service officer and take this form
I will put a link to this form under this post also put it on my blog at HearingLossSupport

com and all you need to do is print this form out and fill it out it'll ask your name address phone number and then it'll ask your the VA's information which VA you're using who's the doctor and then the doctor or the veteran's service officer will sign at the bottom of the form and all you have to do at that point is either email the form fax the form in or mail it snail mail it in so once you get that done the CapTel company will call you and ask you do you want help setting it up she is this the right address i should be sending you the phone to i would really take them up on having someone come out and help set up the phone i'll tell you if there's someone in your area it's also free but it's really helpful for folks to learn more about how the phones work and then make sure they're set up properly so i would really like just take advantage of that because it really does help i am this is information that can be shared to any VA group throughout the u
&gt;&gt; I am a bit unique in that I am a medical oncologist, who practices gynecologic oncology.
So throughout the country, most patients who have gynecologic cancers, ovarian cancer and [inaudible] cancer, uterine sarcomas, most of those patients will see a gynecologic oncologist who is a surgeon, and then that surgeon will also administer their chemotherapy.
We do have surgeons here who do that.
But as the tear, particularly of ovarian cancer patients, it gets a little more complicated.
More medical oncologists who specialize just in the chemotherapy side, just on the therapy side are becoming involved.
And so I work very closely with the surgeons, but then my expertise is taking care of the chemotherapy, the side of patients after they've received their surgery.
So I am a bit of a mixed specialist in that I have internal medicine training, I'm a medical oncologist, but I work very closely with the gynecologic oncologist and treat gynecologic oncology cancer patients.
In addition to thinking about the major themes and keywords to include in your targeted resume, it is helpful to think about how to structure your profession narratives so that it tells an interesting story.
How can you do this?
By strategically ordering the sections of your resume.
In the Master Resume section we examined the various sections your Master Resume should include.
In your targeted resume, order these in an engaging and meaningful way that is appropriate to your background.
This is because the order of your resume sections helps provide logical evidence of your experience.

'Aged' is very uncommon and the only reason to use it is for style
Past it' would be extremely rude if you used it to someone's face
It suggests that someone is too old to be useful, so it's a very strong and disrespectful word
'Venerable' is very uncommon and very literary
It also has the sense of respected
It would only be used in very specific situations, mostly in written English, for example, in a novel
Saying that someone is 'no spring chicken' is a conversational and informal way to say that someone is old
It's not necessarily rude
It could be used in an affectionate or a joking way
Credit card sales are recorded the same as cash sales except the retailer incurs a  processing fee for being able to accept credit cards These fees can range from 2% to 6% depending on the type of card and the amount of business the retailer does.
Let's look at an example.
This couple is purchasing $100 of groceries using a Visa credit card.
Let's assume the retailer pays a 3% fee in order to be able to accept Visa cards.
Finally, for simplicity sake, let's assume this transaction takes place in a state  that doesn't charge sales tax for purchases of groceries-like Minnesota.
The journal entry to record the sale by the retailer is a debit to cash for $97.00. This is the amount the retailer will collect from Visa.
Credit card discount expense is also debited for $3.00. This is the processing fee Visa charges.
Hi You guys, it's Laura here from www.womens-fitness-tips.com.
Okay, I have another product review for you today, and this is a Birchbox review.
Birchbox is a subscription makeup company that sends you products every month.
You pay $10 a month, that's what I did, and every month you get a box from Birchbox with some of their picks for you.
And you put in your preferences based on your age, what you like, the kind of products that you like to buy and they're supposed to match that to your likes and send you stuff that's supposed to be really awesome.
But the problem is, if you're like me, you have drawers full of just samples of so much stuff, like lipsticks you never use, eye shadows you never use, etc., so you really don't need it unless it's really good!
So that's why I want to do the review about it.
So, what you get from Birchbox is this pink box that comes in the mail.
And inside the pink box is brown box.
The packaging is actually really cute.
But what's inside is really what matters, right?! You don't want to pay $10 for a box, at least I don't!
They send you a card that shows you what's in the box and, what the value is of each item in the box.
I didn't know that they were not going to be full sized products.
They're sample sizes.
So, you're paying $10 to get basically four samples, and then a little extra freebie that they put in.
So the first thing in my box was the Bain de Terre Macadamia nut oil.
It's a little sample, like a travel size.
They say the full size is worth $13.50. Okay...it's basically hair oil, it's actually a cream.
Now, we're ready for capital letter D.
Polar attitudes.
I really like that they start with a topic sentence, and the topic sentence is included in the main idea, in both paragraphs.

In 2006 shortly before Google purchased YouTube for $1
65 billion, YouTube was losing money at a rate of $500,000 a month, despite it’s immense popularity
Google however turned that around when they saw its huge advertising potential

During it’s early days, in an attempt to increase popularity, YouTube offered $100 to attractive girls who posted 10 or more videos on their site
The ad was posted on Craigslist, but surprisingly the YouTube founders didn’t receive a single response

So, we just saw what an outsourcing conversation might look like when it includes the entrepreneur, a designer, and a developer.
I want to pull out a couple of parts of that conversation for us to focus on.
The first is a tendency towards scope creep.
Scope creep is whenever the first version of your app isn't the minimum viable product.
Scope creep is bad.
It gets in the way of launching and iterating, which means that you're spending a lot more time building things than building the right things.
As an entrepreneur, you have to make sure that your team isn't introducing scope creep.
But you also have to make sure that you aren't introducing scope creep.

I think Brexit is a very complicated issue and the real key is to try and break it down into its simplest parts.
There are political implications, economic implications, and financial implications.
And for all of them, what happens to Britain and what happens to the United Kingdom is far more damaging than what's going to actually happen for the rest of the world.
From a political perspective, we've got disarray in the Conservative Party in Britain, and in the Labor Party.
I think Britain's biggest problem is actually Scotland, which may well vote to be independent of the United Kingdom, going forward, if that means it can be part of the European Union, which it would now get pulled out of.
But beyond that, for the rest of Europe, you know, there's still 27 countries within the European Union.
I don't see another domino falling.
I don't see another country that will want to follow Britain's lead because I think what Britain is doing to itself will be pretty damaging.
And in terms of political implications for the United States, or for India, or for China, I think those are pretty minor.
From an economic perspective, I think also, the big problem is for Britain.
I think there will be a lack of investment spending in Britain over the next few years, as people just try to figure out what Britain's role in the world is going to be and how it's going to relate to Europe in the future.
That delay, that uncertainty is very negative, as indeed would be tariffs on Britain because after all, Britain is the world's original trading nation.
But again, for the rest of the world, I don't think this hurts the European Union that much, outside of Britain, and I think it has got negligible impacts on the United States.
Remember, Great Britain is less than 4 percent of world GDP.
ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE JANICE JACOBS: Hello, I'm Janice Jacobs.
As Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, I want to affirm the State Department's commitment to the welfare and safety of US citizens around the world, and especially in Egypt during this time.
We are sending aircraft to transport US citizens who wish to leave Egypt to safe havens in Europe.
Upon arrival, US Consular officers are assisting them in making lodging and onward travel plans.
We will continue evacuation efforts to facilitate the safe transport of every US citizen who wishes to leave the country.
Even as non-emergency embassy personnel and family members depart Egypt, we are sending more Consular officers into the country and to our safe haven locations.
Routine services at our embassy in Cairo, such as visa issuance, have been interrupted to permit our total focus on emergency assistance to US citizens.
We have evacuated hundreds of US citizens.
at present, which is separate from the state, the regime, all the classes inside, the government has commitments to a kind of national development model, which is slightly contradictory
And I think, as I said, this is not--they are not coming in the BRICs to create some massive institutional alternative to neoliberalism, because they have all these contradictions

So in the conflict, spaces opened up

My name is Leslie Moselle, and I'm from Tampa Florida, and on behalf of Expert Village, this is how to shop for groceries on a budget.
Ads, when shopping on a budget it's always important to be aware of those ads that you find when checking the mail.
What it means is that we have to use the results that we got much more efficiently.
The good news is there's plenty of room for improvement.
If you went back just fifty years, you'd find a much smaller world economy, a smaller population.
We could afford to waste resources, we could afford to use them like there was no tomorrow, like there was no end.

The Day of Silence has been one of the most successful grassroots protests for gay equality in the past decade.
So it's no surprise that it's also succeeded in drawing the ire of conservative Christians.
Yes, apparently something so simple as students being silent to stand in solidarity with their gay classmates requires a response from the religious right.
They've tried pulling their kids out of school on the Day of Silence, or at least claimed they were going to.
They've tried setting up a so-called "Day of Truth" for their kids to tell people that being gay is a sin - which they decided to cancel because dozens of gay kids were killing themselves.
You'd think that after this, they might give it up and stop trying to refute an anti-bullying campaign.
But like a bad case of ignorance, it just keeps coming back.
This year, Focus on the Family has rebranded it as the "Day of Dialogue". A dialogue about what, you might ask?
Well, it's about "supporting those who want to express their faith-based viewpoints about homosexuality". Because when people are standing up against anti-gay bullying, we can't let that pass without an opposing viewpoint.
But if a dialogue is what they're after, maybe that's just what we need.
When religion is being used to tell gay students that who they are is wrong, we should have a dialogue about that.
If they're going to talk about "what the Bible really says", let's talk about what the Bible really *is*. If they want to talk about how God made us, let's talk about how we made God.

I'm going to talk to you today about how to become a social worker.
This is a very fun and rewarding career.
This is Patrick Munro, Financial Advisor, talking about what is important and why is it important to invest.
Investing is very important for a country at whole and its people to invest because people will save money from their daily work, their daily lives, and put it into banks and financial institutions who will, in turn, lend it out and projects and good projects of work will be done as a result of this effort.
A country, therefore, grows from its savings and its investments.
More jobs and domestic investment may be coming to America, if trends in an Ernst &amp; Young study continue.
The Big4 firm's 2012 US Investment Monitor report concluded that investment in the American economy has strengthened.
By studying 5,000 investments across the country worth $135 billion, Ernst &amp; Young's analysts concluded that investment in American projects is growing.

My name is Jackie Ring and I've been in the teaching field for almost 20 years.
For the last four years I've been teaching English through the internet with the company in Taiwan and I was pretty much in a rut.
I came across my computer career dot com quite by chance I was interviewing at another competitor here in town and I just thought you know this one's so much closer to where I live I should at least give them the courtesy of seeing what they're like and from the moment that I met Miss Melanie Galati I knew this was the right place.
The program that she outlined sounded like something that I could tackle It sounded very well organized, it sounded demanding and challenging, which it is.
and that's how I came to be sitting here in front of you.
You wanted to come to school, it was it was very warm and the first class I had was on a came into class got set up and the teachers walked around to make sure you were comfortable in tackling the assignments and I had a a desk mate, a partner, and I was able to ask questions with my partner so everybody was in there to work together we were all in the same situation if some students were more advanced, they'd turn around and help you so it wasn't like I was on an island all by myself the teachers were there to support you, the other classmates were there to help you it was a fostering, mentoring kind of concept the quality of the information that I've gotten is fantastic.
"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" OK.
Okay, we're working on our cutting for our humorous interpretation.
And we've got--we've already established that it's going to make sense, it's going to have a through line, and it's going to have a beginning, middle, and end.
We're going to take bits and pieces throughout the play to put this story together.
But one of the things that we have to make sure exist is conflict and resolution.
And what conflict and resolution is the big event--the big explosion, the characters get in a fight, or they get together and they get married, or what is the big event that must explode that we've been working for?
Now after this big explosion, he goes to jail, she leaves, he divorces her, somebody dies, whatever this giant conflict is, then our cutting also has to have a resolution.

SECRETARY KERRY: I am blessed to have a niece named Iris, who is one of the most extraordinary young women I've met.
From the day she came into our family, she's filled our lives with love and joy.
And every time I'm with her, I am grateful that my sister Peggy was able to adopt her from China years ago.
Every child needs and deserves to grow up, safe and sound, in a loving home.
But sometimes that's not the kind of environment a child's biological parents are able to provide.
When parents or relatives aren't able to care for children, adoption can help give kids the permanent families that they deserve.
And when adoptive families are not available in the places where these children live, inter-country adoptions can help find them a loving home abroad.
I firmly believe that ethical and transparent inter-country adoption is a critical part of the international children's welfare system.
It helps ensure that kids receive the love and support they need to grow into healthy and productive adults.
I have seen it firsthand.
And that's why I worked hard in the United States Senate to help families navigate past roadblocks in the international adoption process.
I make it happen by often visiting my clients  trying to find out what their needs are,  and providing them with important information  for their business

that in itself also prevented me from really getting to know these characters in a way that I wanted to
I did feel more removed from them
I felt like if one of the characters that was actually actively involved in the scene was the one narrating that maybe I would understand their motivations, their feelings, their emotional reactions to things better than just having an outsider overview
And then the final thing that I want to discuss: I felt like the text of Crooked Kingdom made a couple of jokes that just made me really uncomfortable
KPMG has recently announced the launch of a new position called Head of Global Communications.
When we are able to make emotional wellbeing, part of a child’s health assessment when they enter care
We have the potential to do this really well… You can't fix a problem until you know what the problem is… The key to improving emotional wellbeing is more training for carers, more communication for everyone and more child friendly therapies across the board
Providing carers with expert advice from mental health professionals on how to understand the thoughts and feelings that drive the behaviour of the children in their care
Means that, we feel safer, more cared for and more able to trust people
Encouraging communication between departments and professionals means that they can work together easier
Good morning, I am delighted to introduce you to our International MBA program at IÉSEG, a selective program aimed at successful managers willing to become international leaders.
We have several assets to offer you.
Early stage investors want to invest in people around them because they want to help.
They want to be there on a regular basis and go through this super difficult thing of building a startup.
So, usually, your early investors are going to come from the immediate vicinity around you.
If there are no such investors around you that are aligned with your business or you feel you can reach out to, I think putting yourself in a position where you can find ways.
So for example if you are not in a big metropolitan, perhaps going to accelerator program for a few months.
Perhaps thinking about where the best place to set up your business maybe closer to your customers that might be in a large metropolitan.
&gt;&gt; I decided to go into medicine because it filled kind of the two interests that I have, I've been always interested in physiology of the human body especially of the brain and from the beginning, I was also interested in developing devices that might interface with the brain when people have diseases, for instance, blindness or paralysis or epilepsy.
And really the path I went on was a mixture of both of those things so I want to be able to interact with patients and see and help diagnose them but I also want to develop new treatments for them when standard medicine is unable to help them.
So I think that communication is really a key point, especially neurology.
When someone goes to see a neurologist, they usually have a pretty good idea what they're in for, they often are very scared what the neurologist is going to say.
And in my own specialty of epilepsy, they usually have a pretty good idea that we're going to be talking about seizures.
So I don't pull any punches, the way that I approach it is I am essentially consulting with the patients and the patient needs to become an expert in whatever disease they might have, whatever problem it might be.
To do that, they need to have all of the information necessary and so they need to know exactly what I am thinking.
My plan when a patient comes in is first to collect the information and figure out what's going on.

You ever doing an NCLEX question or nursing question and you had a drug that pop up in the question that you had no idea what it meant, what is for and you don't know how to go about the question? Well guess what?? I'm going to help you figure it out! I'm going to help you to be able to answer any pharmacology question without knowing what it is! subscribe! thanks if you did
Like this video, so that i know that you enjoy this video and please share this video on any social media that you have
Alright so let's get to this video! Alright, the first tip that i have for you is to think about safety! we all know that the goal in nursing and on NCLEX is to show that you are competent in providing patient safety
So if there's ever a question that's asking you to do something, to the patient move the patient or anything like that, always think about safety first! You always want to assess the patient first
Uou always want to see if there's any changes in the patient's condition which can tell you whether they're improving or getting worse
The next thing you should know is to look in detail at the side effects of the drugs
If you understand the side effects of the drugs then you'll know whether it's expected or unexpected and definitely if its an unexpected outcome or unexpected side effect, then you know that there's something wrong and you have to treat that patient first, right? Alright so my suggestion to you, is to learn the top side effects of each drug classification so that you'll never be lost
if you can understand the top side effects or the overall side effects of a particular classification of drug then you'll be able to you know, answer that question with ease because you'll be able to eliminate those that definitely don't belong in that classification
I also think it's very important that when you're studying the diseases that you understand the top drugs that treat that disease
With that in mind, you'll be able to identify the drug immediately
It's also important to recognize the generic names of these drugs because on NCLEX unfortunately that's all they're giving us
I won't really say "unfortunately" because I feel like even though it was kind of tough to study, it was really important to know because in the medical field the doctors are gonna give you generic so it's best to be familiar with the generic and brand-name for these meds
On NCLEX, you'll definitely see generic names being given, so familiarize yourself with that and you'll be fine
Another thing I would suggest is, elimination
There's a random drug in the option choice, and you absolutely don't know what it means, your best bet is to eliminate it and then critically think through the question to see if it make sense to stick with the answer choice left
I’m David Kulma and I’m running for Congress in South Carolina’s 5th District
Here’s the deal: Because of the influence of corporate and big donor money in politics, our federal government doesn’t represent you
The bottom 90% of income earners, that is us, have almost no influence on public policy
But there is a loophole in our system
Most of us can vote
So let’s send a signal to Washington, D

, and tell them that we are done with their bullshit and their fealty to the donor class, giant corporations, and their lobbyists, and send a person to Congress who will work for us instead of them
I and the Green Party, unlike everyone else in this race, refuse to take corporate donations
I have no super PAC
We want money out of politics
We want a government that actually represents the people
Hi guys, I'm Logan.

In US culture when someone sneezes one may typically say bless-you.
But in Asian cultures one does not typically say bless-you.
I know in the Chinese culture when someone sneezes it means that someone is talking about you.

I am so delighted to be joining you for this year's Social Good Summit.
And I want to thank Mashable, 92Y, the UN Foundation, Ericsson, the Gates Foundation, and UNDP for creating this extraordinary platform for global engagement.
You know, leaders from around the world are coming together this week at the United Nations seeking solutions for some of the toughest challenges we all face.
And at the same time, a revolution in social media is helping people everywhere take part in a global conversation about how we can work together to advance the common good.

Some of the things we've done that have I think helped this is a friend of mine and our company president, Jeff, is really good about asking questions
Tarot cards are a great tool you can use to get spiritual guidance
They can help you develop your natural intuition, learn to trust the spiritual guidance you're receiving, and give you accurate, helpful answers to the questions you have about your life
When I started learning tarot cards, I memorized all the meanings for the cards, and I looked in the book every time I did a reading, and that's the way most people learn
But what I noticed was that when I focused on the traditional, generic meanings, all my readings were


generic! I wanted accurate insights
Eventually my Spirit Guides started working with me and teaching me how to read the tarot intuitively
This is something anyone can learn to do
Even if you've never picked up tarot cards before, and you have no confidence in your intuition, with this course I lead you through intuitive tarot reading, step by step
It's fun and easy to do, and it can help you get a lot of great insight about any area of your life
This course has 12 easy-to-navigate sections, 39 videos, almost 3 hours of video content, and all of the videos are closed captioned
There's also tons of written content and lots of exercises to help you practice what you're learning
Plus, I give you insights into my own tarot journal, and you can read the readings that I've done for my life
When you order the course, you'll get an email with the link and password so you can get started right away
The first time I saw my future husband was in a tarot reading
When I wanted guidance about what career path would make me feel happy and fulfilled, I found guidance in a tarot reading
And anytime in my life when I feel like I'm struggling and I need some clarity about my direction, I do a tarot reading
It's a great tool that you can use to get spiritual insight and tune into your own sense of direction
This course is not just about learning the tarot
It's about learning to trust yourself and that internal guidance that you have all the time
You know, everyone says that you have all the answers within you
Yeah, that's true, but sometimes it's really hard to figure out what those answers are [Laughs]

KRISTEN PERRY: I think it's really hard to see sometimes when our leaders aren't standing up and taking the leadership that they need to on climate
The science is very clear
We're seeing people being affected all over the world from climate change, and a lot of people still aren't doing anything about it
But then there are grassroots organizations, are everyday, normal people just like us coming out here and really having our voices heard and coming together to work together, and so I think that's really inspiring
So, now you're meeting somebody or you're just getting ready to say hello with a handshake, how do you do it?
Hi, I'm Hazely Lopez from Hazely Academy of Refinements and Modeling and I'm here to show you handshake etiquette.
All right?
First things first, and you want to make sure you introduce yourself extending your hand.
Of course, you then shake it maybe one or two pumps is okay and also make it brief.
You don't need to stay there for all the time.
In other words, a racing heart doesn't cause fear, nor does the feeling of fear result in a racing heart, rather, both things just happen together
Today, most psychologists agree that our emotions are also tangled up with our cognition: whether or not we're afraid of a dog on the sidewalk depends a lot on whether we're interpreting the animal's behavior as threatening or friendly, probably also, what our personal history with dogs is
In the 1960s, American psychologist Stanley Schachter and Jerome Singer interpreted this idea that cognition can define emotion, into what they called their "two-factor theory"
They believed that to experience emotion, you must both fear physiological arousal, and cognitively label that arousal
And again, please remember that in psychology, arousal is different from how you're used to using it

A surprise twist in AFER's Virginia lawsuit
The Indiana House passes a marriage ban, but in so doing could actually delay its progress
Utah and Oklahoma cases are speeding towards the Supreme Court, and our chances for victory have greatly improved in Nevada
Plus there's progress this week in West Virginia, Hawaii, and Kansas
For the American Foundation for Equal Rights, I'm Matt Baume, and welcome to Marriage News Watch for February 3, 2014
Last week a judge in Virginia ruled that oral arguments would proceed in AFER's federal marriage case
But then we got an unexpected setback: snow
Bad weather postponed the hearing, scheduled for last Thursday, to Tuesday of this week
Stay tuned for further announcements about our day in court
The Indiana House passed a constitutional marriage ban last week
But that might actually be good news
House lawmakers stripped the bill of a sentence that would have banned civil unions as well
Because the language was changed, the bill will likely have to start the approval process all over again, which would push it back to 2016, at the earliest
Indiana polling has fluctuated wildly, so it's impossible to detect a trend that would predict how voters will behave in two years
But it's possible that the Senate could restore the language and refer the bill to a conference committee, in which case it could pass and head to voters this year
Or the Senate could kill it altogether
We'll be keeping a close eye on the volatile situation there, with further developments expected this week
We have a date for hearings in the Utah and Oklahoma cases
Both cases recently won major victories for equality, and now head separately to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals
The court will hear the Utah case on April 10, and the Oklahoma case on April 17
Though the cases haven't been consolidated, the court may rule simultaneously on both
If they rule promptly, both cases could go to the US Supreme Court in its next session
Last week we reported that a Nevada case will be significantly impacted by a ruling in the Ninth Circuit that extended heightened scrutiny to LGBTs
Now Nevada Attorney General Katherine Cortez has announced that she will review the arguments made in a marriage case there
A district could had previously ruled against the freedom to marry, but this new standard of scrutiny could render all of our opponents' arguments invalid on the pending appeal
A case in West Virginia will progress after a judge denied a motion to dismiss
Marriage is safe in Hawaii, where a judge last week rejected a lawsuit against last year's equality act
And Equality Kansas has requested the introduction of two bills to repeal that state's marriage ban
It's still too early to evaluate the bills' chances of success, but we'll be keeping a close eye on the situation in Kansas
Those are the headlines

As you’ve been meeting people these first few weeks on campus, I’m sure you’ve heard a lot of “What’s your major?” For those of you who know, this may be a fun question to answer.
For those of you who don’t know, this question may be increasingly irritating.
This week we want you to work to understand the various fields and disciplines of engineering.
You already know what students study in history, math, biology.
However, very few students, when they arrive here, know what students study in mechanical engineering, civil engineering, and computer science.
To help you sort through these various disciplines, faculty from all of our departments have created short videos explaining what their discipline is, and what a career in their field might look like.
DISCUSSING MERGER OF TECH SCHOOLS &amp; COLLEGES TRT 1:08    First of all we're wary of any and all so-called education proposals based solely on saving money.
Believe it or not saving money is not the answer to every issue we face in this country, and we're seeing evidence repeated cuts to funding for education are jeopardizing quality, access and competitiveness.
Just this week 35 principals from southern Wisconsin sent a letter to Governor Walker about the negative impacts of recent budgets.
That said, efficient administration of public education in this state that protects or enhances quality, is worth pursuing if it makes sense.
My name is Jamie Servellon and my goal is to work in the entertainment industry.
I took my under graduate in psychology originally but I also minored in communications and communications always fascinated me and I actually worked here at WRHU which is the radio station here at Hofstra and that’s something that I always wanted to pursue and I love and that’s actually a great field in the entertainment business.
So what I wanted to do instead of mastering in psychology I wanted to master in communication because that’s something that always fascinated me.
I actually was taking some speech courses in under graduate and one of my professors actually recommended me the program because he knew what I wanted to study and he told me this is a great area of study because I can actually be flexible and move around any area of communications I wanted to.
Dear Assemblymen and Policy Makers, Thank you for taking the time to view my testimony today regarding Bill A705 Prohibiting the Department of Health from reducing reimbursement rates of the early intervention program.
My name is Sharon Shafrir.
My husband and I live in Rochester NY and raise two children.
Our youngest, is a charming 4-year old that is living with severe developmental and medical challenges.
We have hands-on experience with the benefits of Early Intervention: through EI, my son achieved physical and intellectual mile stones.
He can sit on his own, eat solids independently of artificial feeding support, and is capable of communicating through assistive technology.
EI providers supported him and us during the first 3 years of his life.
Without them he would have been subjected to multiple respiration illnesses as he wouldn’t have been able to breathe and eat on his own; he would have had a very weak foundation of learning skills that are necessary to build upon with opportunities at school, and the toll on us, as a productive family and tax paying members of the community would have been by far greater.
Currently, many EI providers are being forced out of business by a rate structure that seriously underestimates the cost of providing these valuable services.
I fear that reducing Early Intervention program reimbursement rates will force even more veteran professionals to seize rendering their expertise to EI children, it will make employment in this field even less attractive to new professionals, and will eventually cause these essential services to reach fewer eligible children.

Hello everyone, Braden Kelley here, author of the popular book Stoking Innovation Bonfire, an accessible look at 10 of the most common barriers to innovation that organizations face all around the world as they seek to make innovation a deeply embedded capability of the organization.
In addition the book also serves as a great innovation primer and is being used by universities like Creighton and acquired in quantity by companies including Microsoft and AB InBev to help establish a common language for innovation in their organizations.
One of the most popular parts of the book has been the Nine Innovation Roles which takes a team-based approach to innovation and innovation success.
Instead of looking at whether someone has innovator's DNA or the right innovation personality the Nine Innovation Roles takes a roles-based approach to innovation team success.
And in a group workshop environment you can really investigate and delve into how to best structure your teams for achieving that success that you want to have in innovation.
In order to support that effort within your organization I'm happy to make a few things available for free download today.
That includes the design for the cool cards that I use in my workshops with Fortune 500 companies around the world and also a presentation that you can download to kick things off or a video if you want just a little bit more to help kick off you team meeting or workshop using the Nine Innovation cards that you can download and either print with the printer that I use @magic at your cost or with a printer in your local area, wherever you might be in the world.
Now that doesn't mean that you still can't hire me to come and do a workshop for you and maybe kick it off with a great keynote but I'm happy to make these things available for free for the organizations that may not have a budget for something like this, whether they might be in a governmental organization or just going through a tough time right now.
But if you do want to hire me for a workshop you can find all the details on NineRoles.com and you can find all of these free downloads also on NineRoles.com including the card deck, the presentation, and the video so I hope you'll check it out.
And this has been Braden Kelley, author of Stoking Innovation Bonfire.
I just have one last thing to say and that's keep innovating.
Hey guys, this is Richard with Short Term Rental Secrets
com and today I was taking a look at some Air B&amp;Bs that I'm thinking about staying in and thought it'd be really helpful to share with you some of the things that I think people are doing really well and some of the areas for improvement as it relates to your airbnb listing
So this is sort of how to optimize the success of your airbnb listing using the description strategically
The first thing I would say is Airbnb does a really good job of laying out different sections that you're supposed to fill in
So they tell you in a standardized template, you know, fill this and fill this in, fill this in and I think people basically do that
They check the box and so there's a bare minimum of information but don't forget this is marketing, right? This isn't just like information gathering
People that are looking to stay at your home or your bedroom, they're looking for an experienced they're not looking for a minimum criteria
They're looking for a maximum experience
So one of the mistakes I see people make all the time is they just literally detail all of the criteria, the features, has TV, has Wi-Fi has this, has that, has the other, and it leaves for the guests to interpret, Well gee this is how I might use it or this is what it might mean
And the best listings I see really create a vivid vision of what your time might be like
So like in this particular one that I'm looking at it says enjoy having breakfast or dinner on the cozy terrace
Gee like I would love to do that! That sounds really really nice
They could have just said breakfast China, lunch utensils, terrace, but instead they painted the picture: Enjoy having breakfast on the cozy terrace which do you think the average reader is going to be drawn towards or pay a premium for or book first? So the first tip that I would say is you really want to think about all of the things that your Airbnb listing has to offer
Why you put them in there, how they're used, and create this fantasy, draw them into you know your home and why you did it this way and how you use it, how others have used it, why they use it that way, why the location is primed for different things
Don't just say it's in this location, it's in this location, which means you can walk for breakfast here and you can go there for lunch and then complete the day by having a drink over here whatever it is and now somebody thinks gee you're really speaking to me the individual you're talking my language and I think you're going to find much more rewarding bookings more income and also better SEO
And like anything else it's iterative right so your first listing shouldn't be your last listing you should visit it, you should check it out, you should improve it, you should a/b test it, try different language
Some of the adjectives that you might find are really helpful you won't know on day one
So really take the time and energy, invest at the time and energy in your description because at the end of the day it's going to drive revenue and that's after all why you're doing this
So I hope you found this helpful and go ahead and subscribe to our YouTube channel
We're filming content like this all the time and we really hope to see you soon
Hi, Frank Leutz, Desert Car Care Service Centers.
Here to talk about auto repair marketing.
We have a store in Chandler and we have auto repair stores on Dobson and Chandler Boulevard, as well as in Gilbert, Williams Field and Val Vista.
I want to talk to you a little bit about NARPRO today, and how they help with auto shop advertising.
Our company has been members of NARPRO for, it's going on almost six years and we're very proud members.
NARPRO has a pretty rigid set of guidelines that we certainly want to be a part of, ultimately, as a consumer tool.
Plus, it's great automotive marketing.
But I've got to tell you, as a company,   in today's economic climate of competitive nature that exists in our market, we sure do enjoy being part of NARPRO.
It's a working program.
Not only do we get the benefit of key consumers checking our auto shops out and going online, and ultimately coming in the auto shops to do business with us, but we get a family of other car repair shop owners that we can network with - hashing out new auto repair advertising ideas and marketing ideas.
It's very hard, as far as marketing is concerned   there's a lot of noise out there.
So if I ever have a need or a question   about a certain item that I'm reviewing, I can count on NARPRO other car repair shop members, including the great guys   and gals over at NARPRO, to kind of help me out, so that, for us, is a very good benefit.
There's no doubt that marketing that NARPRO does online is really awesome.
They do take the time to manage out a strategy and a   course to get the best customer for our pipeline.
You know, we can throw darts at the board and try   to get everyone to come in our auto shops, but if we dial in and get a key consumer that understands the value of what we have to offer from our   ethics, our standards, our master technicians, the shop equipment that we have on board, that's a customer for us.
That's the general story structure shape
But here's the shape of three act story structure

I'm Pamela Unruh on behalf of Expert Village.
As an employer asking your employees to provide great customers service, it's also important that you're committed to providing them the tools that they can use in order to make sure that that happens.

Hi, This is just a quick video review using this great product, which is a Shampoo Scalp Massage Brush that I just got from Nizoralshop.com.
One thing about this brush is that you can use it to shampoo your hair and massage your scalp.
Actually, you can even use it applying conditioner, styling products and hair treatments.
Nizoralshop says that you could also use for hair loss treatment products with it.
The fact that you don't need to use your fingers is great because any product you apply goes into your hair for a better scalp absorption.
With its large ergonomic handle, senior citizens and people with special needs can grab the shampoo scalp massage brush very easily.
It also features a large and soft silicone pad and bristles.
So, you can shampoo and get nice and gentle scalp massages at the same time.

Her son was diagnosed at the age of two with this horrible, horrible diagnosis but she turned this tragedy into something amazing and her son had done brilliant artwork all through the years of his therapy with an art therapist.
She put that together in a book that tells his story and then went on to write other books telling other autistic childrens' stories through art.
The purpose of it all, focusing on early intervention.
She strongly believes that early intervention saved and changed her son's life.

&gt;&gt; India will not be able to become a superpower if it does not invest seriously in its richest natural resource, that is, an adolescent girl in poverty.
As she becomes the mother of every child of the next generation and an active member of civil society and the business world, she will drive growth and stability and prosperity in this country.
One of our interesting new projects is we attached radio frequency transmitters, RFID tags, to grocery carts.
And we watched the way the carts went up and down the aisles of the store, and we related that to the purchases that people made.
We find that there's very similar patterns when we look at customer paths in other domains.
So one example would be online.
SAM SEBASTIAN: Digital marketing is now a key ingredient in a lot of the marketing departments within big B2B firms for three main reasons.
Yeah, I think at the end of the day, we all need to make sure that we're in the inspiration business.
And inspiration internally, there’s been a fair amount of talk over the last several days about talent.
Hello, my name is Darin Carter on behalf of Expert Village.
Today I am going to show you how to design and promote your business card.
Alright we are now complete.
Looks like we have finished up printing our business cards or sending them to a company to get them printed.
My name is Jeremy Vreeken
I am a Dordt student, a junior here, studying English
I'll agree that theologically the matter of like who build the earth is sort of important
Um, but I think that for a lot of people my age it got frustrating when we had no practical living out advice
"Okay, so now that God created the world, what do you do about it and how do you live best on it, and with it?" And I think, um, yeah, I was striving for more of a well-rounded perspective on those issues and I wasn't getting it from the church
And that, um, made me really sad
You know, you grow up in it
People who love you and you love it, and it's, you want to reconcile those two things
Coming here actually I met a lot of fellow students and good professors who were really passionate about how to live practically in the world
Whether that is solving food desert issues or whether that is going abroad and purifying water and stuff like that, I think
It just got me really interested, and I saw that practical living out that I was looking for earlier
And then I went back home and looked for ways to do it too
And got involved in urban farming
Like, you were talking about with the leaders, I think it is important to get them on board
I think a lot of people on churches look to them strongly - as perhaps they should - for advice and leadership on how to live
If churches want to be ahead of this issue then their leaders need to be able to speak about it, and so my hope would be that they find a way to feel comfortable and feel knowledgeable about those issues and help the congregants follow along
I would say, people my age really care about it
You know, you hear a lot about us -- us as in millennials or whatever you want to call it leaving the church
So, my message to a church leader would be


I mean, it kind of sounds like blackmail but if you want us to stay, you got to get on board with some of these issues and start helping us figure out ways to reconcile our faith with a way to live in the world, that makes sense to us and is better for the earth
We love you, we love God, we love the earth, and we just all want to be together on it, I think you see a lot of young people not voting
And I think, everybody knows that
Um, and part of that is because we don't trust you


if I'm speaking to a political leader
And you, as in the body that represents all government
have this feeling inside that I'm not enough
It triggers that emotion and so understanding that, I can actually say, "okay I'm not enough
That's definitely a lie and I can let it go" I can let it go, which brings me to the next step
Step number two is, managing your emotions
This step might for some of you on this new journey of emotions and emotional intelligence might feel counterintuitive
But let me tell you, as you practice this, it will become a powerhouse tool for you
Managing your emotions is the ability to allow yourself to feel your emotions, to feel what you're feeling without judging yourself
That's really really important because when you judge the emotion that you're feeling the negative emotion that you're feeling, it anchors it in
It actually causes it to last longer
but that's the way it is

So you can make posts, you can make videos, and people are just like, "No, that's, no I don't believe you


You know why this probably happens

Because we're under the age of 60 years old
People will believe old people like that but if you're younger, no you're too young to do this
There are a few things that you need to understand about the role of income and employment in obtaining home financing in today's market.
The days of stated income are long gone.
These days you are required to provide proof of income and employment in order to obtain home financing.
The type of proof varies depending on the types of income you receive.
If you follow this link or go to our Additional Resources section, you will find a document that tells you exactly which types of documentation you will need to provide as proof of income and employment.
Lenders are looking at your consistency and continuity of employment.
They want to look back two years and ahead 2-3 years to determine whether or not you've had stable and consistent employment.
Any kinds of gaps in employment, any kind of frequent job changes will all need to be explained thoroughly to the lenders.
Marquez knows it wasn't red mist that caused the incident.
It's very clear from the helicopter footage that I didn't want to make him crash, I just wanted to make him lose time, go outside of the line and slow down, because he was playing his dirty game, even worse than in Australia.
When I went wide and slowed down to nearly a stop, I looked at him as if to say 'what are you doing?'. After that we touched.
He touched with his right underarm on my leg and my foot slipped off the foot peg.
If you look at the image from the helicopter it's clear that when my foot slipped of the foot peg, Marquez had already crashed.
I didn't want to kick him, especially because, if you give a kick to a MotoGP bike, it won't crash, it's very heavy.
For me the sanction is not fair, because Marquez won his fight.
His program is OK because he is making me lose the championship.
The sanction is not good, especially for me, because I didn't purposefully want to make him crash, I just reacted to his behaviour, but I didn't kick him.
Boy, there was a lot of reading in this program.
And all of it was new for me, so some of it I had to read over and over.
When you're looking at a new subject and you're learning it for the first time, read through it once without taking notes, and then go back over it maybe with a highlighter or with the idea of taking notes.
I would usually make it once through the reading if I had time to do it before the class, but I would never go back and try to read the whole chapter again.
I would go back and focus on certain things that were brought up in class.
The British people have decided to leave the European Union.
As it defines the next chapter in its relationship with the EU, I know that the United Kingdom's position in NATO will remain unchanged.
The UK will remain a strong and committed NATO Ally, and will continue to play its leading role in our Alliance.
Today, as we face more instability and uncertainty, NATO is more important than ever as a platform for cooperation among European Allies, and between Europe and North America.
A strong, united and determined NATO remains an essential pillar of stability in a turbulent world, and a key contributor to international peace and security.
STEPHEN O’KANE: The Auditor General is an independent statutory officer that reports to the parliament and his role is to provide reviews under the Audit Act of public sector management and activities, with a view to looking at financial accountability but also efficiency and effectiveness.
The Ombudsman is another important statutory officer who reports to the parliament and the Ombudsman’s office provides reviews of the application and management of public sector resources and also responds to complaints and issues raised by members of the public.
but don't get discouraged yet because they actually don't know what kind of number in that test are great or bad
They rank the candidates on the basis of the type of applications they get
If they get applications where people couldn't even clear the GATE, but you could, then you are in luck
My final advice would be to apply to as many Universities as you can if your grades are not that great
A Grade Point of 8-9 is considered very good and you will have no problem in applying to the University
But we all know the struggle of getting that kind of grades in India
It's really no joke

Quick update.
Wanted to let you know about a community request that we implemented into the Google+ Help Center.
Advertising that’s helpful for students that are prospects looking for education range anywhere from television commercials that they see while they’re watching TV, and it really brings back the brand and to mind.
And a lot of people will go to the internet and then search out for educational opportunities.
Hi I'm Dr. Simcha Shapiro here with Expert Village.
Now we're going to talk about an Osteopathic technique called strain counter strain.
Now strain counter strain was developed in the 70's by Lawrence Jones.
Strain counter strain was developed in the 70's by Lawrence Jones and the basis to the technique is to shorten the muscle that we're working with in order to release it and to reset the pain mechanism.
Well, there are great opportunities for marketers to really recognize that self expression has become the new entertainment.
So while there are many people who are still wondering, “Why are people spending all this time editing Wikipedia entries, or uploading video on their Facebook profiles or blogging on the Huffington Post?” The answer is they love it.
In bankruptcy we often deal with the situation where cars have more equity then is the exemption available to apply to the car.
So I want to talk for a minute about ways that we can deal with that situation.
First of all let's just real quickly define what we mean by the word equity.
And equity is simply taking the value of the item in this case the car minus what is owed on it.
So if somebody owns a car that’s worth $5,000 and they have a $3,000 car loan $5,000 minus $3,000 the equity in the car is $2,000. So what do we do in a situation where the amount of equity in the car is greater than the amount of exemption that we have to apply to it.
Because if we don’t do anything they’re going to owe the trustee that non-exempt equity amount.
So there’s several things that we can do.
I’m going to talk about two which are probably the most common.
One is the individual can trade the car in on a new car, newer car, just to make sure that they don’t end up with more equity in the new car than they have exemption and we do that very, very often.
Another scenario that we follow that we do quite often, is the best way to describe it is to use an example.
Let’s say we have our $5,000 car and the person doesn’t owe anything on it.
The car is free and clear.
When it comes to speaker selections, there are tons and tons of choices out there.
As disciples of Jesus we are called to be SALT and LIGHT to be ambassadors for HIM and to bring MORE people to JESUS that they would be led by Jesus and obey HIM FULLY!
We are NOT called to elevate ourselves or our families or anything else but to be pleasing to Jesus.
It seems for the most part people have used the internet, including Christians only to glorify themselves, to promote themselves.
They are stuck in pornography and in sin, rather than using the internet like Facebook or Youtube for the glory of Jesus.
It is a SAD thing because the devil is using Christians to spread his gospel.
Yet Christians are NOT choosing to obey Jesus, their eye is no longer the lamp of lamp of their body, but their eye is BAD so everything they are putting out is bad it is evil.
If you choose to follow Jesus you HAVE to surrender to HIM, be salt and light, be a testimony for Jesus.
Clean up your sight or delete it.
Either be a testimony for Jesus on the internet or get off.
&gt;&gt;MORGAN: Hi there!
My name is Morgan McLellan and i just completed the eight week BuiltLean program.
Let me just say this program has changed my entire life.
I have never had so much confidence.
I mean, for the first time, I can take my shirt off and not feel self conscious about my body.
No more swimming with T-shirts on.
I know, it was crazy to begin with!
Now, the BuiltLean program doesn't promise you to lose three pounds in 30 days, you know, they don't deliver frozen food to your house, but what it does deliver on is this: The most comprehensive guide you can find anywhere to getting into the best shape in your life.
This is another of my favorite albums
Now you might wonder, why are you buying your favorite albums again
I have multiple copies of albums like this that I always misplace or that I burned onto one system and then lost the CD
In my undergraduate degree; I did a Chemistry undergraduate degree, as part of that we do kinetics and specifically, at my university, we did atmospheric kinetics.
I really enjoyed that, but I didn't enjoy the atmospheric application, so when I found out, eventually, through my industrial placement that there was this pharmacokinetics area (which is the kinetics of drugs in the body), I really enjoyed that.
It combines parts of Biology, Chemistry and Maths, so I really enjoyed an area which is quite diverse and brought all these aspects together.
It seems to me, one of the simple keys to success in connecting with the consumer in the automobile business is consistency.
be because eventually, they're human beings
So it sounds a little different
So in my world, I know it's called recruiting in everybody's world but we need guys that are great football players
We need guys that are great students
We want great human beings, all right
That's the trifecta, we want all three
But if they don't buy in to what we do and how we do it, it's a waste of time for him, it's a waste of time for us
Because our culture will be set by the daily practices of the people that live there
If they don't work as hard as we need them to, if they don't prioritize the scholastic part of being a college football student, student athlete
They are not going to make it here
And they may drag a couple of other people down
This is financial adviser Patrick Munro, talking about the goal of financial management.
The goal of financial management should be two fold.
around Cory about sand under the climbing structure, I know I can come to Cory and say, "Hey, what happened
" This morning there was some sand under the climbing structure
How come you didn't sweep
" And Cory could say, "I had a had a late pick-up yesterday
" And that gives me an idea that she didn't do it on purpose
And so part of this team is that we assume the best of everyone

The children don't break things because they want to break them
Children don't that children done don't break things because they want of a children bite each other because they want to buy each other

And we put that practice into our own relationships
It's okay to have struggles and I think for us teachers we somehow in this profession we have decided that it's not okay to struggle


I guess you could say it's an occupational hazard

When I'm out with my friends, the last thing I want to worry about is an overdraft fee on my account.
Thankfully, CashCourse has a way for me to make sure that I'm banking my money correctly, and they teach me how to save my money and choose the correct checking account.
Hallucinations and delusions are common occurrences in someone who has Alzheimer's disease.
It's best to really understand what they are.
First, hallucinations are seeing things or hearing voices when there's nothing there.
These are real experiences and you can't talk someone out of them.
PENRY PRICE: Hard to predict, as we all know.
I would say what's a picture of it to me is much more personal.
So the idea of the mobile device, obviously, becoming a true platform for communication, is basically upon us, it's really close.
And I think that will change marketing again, just as the beginning of the web discussion changed marketing to a degree.
So I think the personalization of marketing is going to be a big part of what happens over the next few years, really enabled by the mobile device.
Hi, I'm Brad Bear on behalf of Expert Village.
In this title I want to talk a little bit about up conversion of DVDs and what that kind of is.
With HD DVD players and Blu-ray players, they automatically take your standard definition disk or content, say a TV show or a movie that you've bought.
Your older DVDs, your regular DVDs and they will take those and play those back just like they would their HD or Blu-ray disks that they were designed for.
The only difference is they will take that signal and actually make the image larger in the disk.
What they do is they double the amount of resolution or the amount of lines that that disk was made with to display optimally on your HD TV set.
Now what happens is your standard definition content is at four hundred and eighty lines.
Hey guys, this is Brodie Arldt
I will be doing a eulogy over my grandfather, so here it is
For those of y'all who don't know me I'm Brodie Arldt, Raymond's grandson
My grandfather lived a life full of faithfulness, happiness, pride, and joy
He would serve two years for the United States Army in World War II He would then return to Texas to marry my grandmother, Betty Packorny, of Pflugerville, on August twelfth, nineteen fourty-seven
In nineteen fifty-seven he would have his first daughter, my aunt, Pamela Blaha
In nineteen sixty-seven, he would have his second and last child, my mother, Cheryl Blaha
In nineteen ninety-one, Raymond became a grandpa
His daughter Pam and son-in-law Mark had a baby girl,later on in 1993 having a second
It wasn't until 1996, that I first met my Pa-Paw
At that moment my Pa-Paw knew I was something special
Mainly because I would be his only grandson
There are many memories Pa-Paw and I would share
One of my favorite memories is when he took me for the first time to go fishing down at the stock tank
From that day on I have always loved to fish
I was very fortunate to be his sideman when it came to working cattle, fixing fence, working on the barn, working on the truck, just basically anything
I was always there right beside him and I was lucky to have him
Another memory I have is when he let me drive his old farm pick-up
That thing was standard so it took us all day just to learn how to drive it
He never let me give up though
He always just smiled and laughed and said you can do this and then he would re-teach me
We spent that whole day just driving that truck around the pasture until I finally learned how to do it These are some of the memories I will hold close to me and cherish
Anyone who knew my grandfather knows of his generosity, work ethic, humility, and selflessness
He demonstrated these traits again and again throughout his whole life
He also demonstrated these traits through working on a farm, the war, or at Montgomery Ward where he worked for 32 years
Whatever my Pa-Paw was involved in, he made sure it was done the right way, that no corners were cut, and he made sure that everyone was happy
My Pa-Paw was the one man I looked up to
When I grew up I wanted to be just like him
Everything I learned, I learned from my Pa-Paw
In conclusion to this eulogy, Pa-Paw you will be missed dearly
Someday I hope to become half the man you were
People like my Pa-Paw are one in a million
Anyone who was around him knew of his work ethic, his big heart, generosity, and selflessness
So let us celebrate my Pa-Paw's life, and continue his legacy
This is financial adviser Patrick Munro talking about what is the definition of a home equity loan.
Of course our home is our biggest assets when we get one and we take out our primary loan, we start to achieve a higher rate of return when we pay down the mortgage balance and of course the appreciation over time the house gets worth more.
Dr. Grigg's lectures have made it clear that water conflicts occur on various scales, with larger scales involving greater complexity.
Many of these conflicts involve different types of users.
Effective governance, which is often difficult to achieve, is key to management of these conflicts.
Our next lecture focuses on one sector of water use in particular: water for irrigated agriculture.
&gt;&gt;Craig Barrrett: Hi, You Tube.
I'm Jonathon Ayers with Network for Success and today we are going to talk about "What is computer memory?" Computer memory, that's a great subject because there are so many different types of memory that your computer actually has.
What's the most common one that we all think about?
I guess we all think about storage space.
We've got thousands of photos, where are we going to put them, let's put them into memory.
What type of memory is that?
I'm very pleased to have this opportunity to speak to your global conference.
This year Britain holds the presidency of the G8, and one of our top priorities is greater transparency.
Greater transparency&nbsp;in both how governments and businesses operate.
That's the message Britain will be taking to its partners at next month's G8 summit, and that's the message which brings everyone here today.
Nowhere is transparency more important than the extractive industries.
In the past, some countries have been stripped of their oil, gas and minerals behind closed doors.
Their citizens remained poor instead of benefiting from these riches and their countries often missed out on the best deal.
The EITI was set up to fight against this, a global standard of open payments for natural resources.
For years you've done brilliant work.
Giving people the tools to make sure better deals are done.
Working in co-operation with governments and businesses to do so.
This week your conference marks an important milestone as you adopt an even higher standard.
And I'm delighted that Britain has announced that this week we're implementing the EITI ourselves because every country should have to play by exactly the same rules.

Hello, I’m Bertrand J.
Simpson, Jr., Esquire, and next semester I will have the privilege of teaching Political Science 355, a course entitled African-American Political Thought.
The purpose of the course is to study the life experiences of the African diaspora here from the end of the Civil War to the modern times.
The material we will use in the course will help us understand how that particular community established for itself a political and social identity within the larger context of American civil society.
I believe it was Plato Socrates who once opined that the youth are ill-suited to study political science.

Hey, my name is Carroll and I am 45 years old.
I want to share with you a new cosmetic item that is now a permanent part of my  make-up bag,  and that is Lefery cream.
It is absolutely wonderful, I fell in love with it from the very first time I saw it and used it.
It smells wonderful, the texture is  very smooth, it absorbs instantly.
&gt;&gt;Nigel Morris: Okay, I'm Nigel Morris.
I'm the CEO of Isobar which is a digital marketing network.
I actually don't think the environment is going to lose out to the economy in 2009. Partly the reason for that, is that the economy is in many respects a subset of the environment.
I think people are beginning to realize that the old models of mass, the old models of producing things that we don't need, of consuming things that we don't really need to consume in the West is actually broken.
And actually people are beginning to realize that a sustainable mode of consumption and a sustainable mode of production are the only things that are going to generate sustainable jobs, they are going to create sustainable economies.
I think they are actually going to get us back to having a real economy in a real world.
That's interesting coming from someone who works in digital.
Actually, again, I think that digital is going to be the key driver.
That's because: one, the more and more of the business processes the more that go digital, the more impact they are going to have in the physical world.

Now let's talk about being on the other end of the disclaimer.
When someone says a disclaimer to you and you respond to that disclaimer, it's real important that you acknowledge what the person said in their disclaimer.
Let's say, if I said to you, "I know you're going to think I'm crazy, but..." The person that I'm speaking to should then respond back with, "I'm not going to think you're crazy," or "I know you think I'm going to think you're crazy." Alright.
The production hiatus lasted about a week
To this day, the actual family matter was never actually revealed, which is pretty strange

Oddly enough, the couple didn't actually go through with filing for divorce until about two and a half years later
the divorce was ultimately settled in June 2013
The couple has since remained completely amicable and committed to raising their only daughter, Coco
That friendship might explain the delay
Cox told More magazine in 2014: "In divorce you always have regret
We were married for a long time, so it's not like we didn't try

Hey everyone, Aaron here again with yet another helpful video about binary options and how you can successfully trade them.
I'm here today to talk to you a little about some of the top stocks on the binary options.
Now, obviously, every trader looks at stocks a little differently, so the list I'll give you might not be like other lists you see out there, because it's MY list - a list of stocks I prefer to trade.
To me, what makes a stock great to trade is the size of the company the stock represents.
The bigger the company, the more information you can get.
Apple is one of my favorites because you can anticipate quite a few of the changes its stock will make.
Whenever apple launches a new product, its market becomes extremely active.
seminars, different workshops, different conferences and that really impressed me and I felt as if I was at home because everybody was so nice to me and everybody was so supportive, and this really helped me to transition smoothly and concentrate hard on my education

Hello Hubsters, Gareth James video guy from Clockwork Eye here
Bringing you hints, tips, do's, don'ts and advice on video marketing so that you can get more creative with your video
And basically what I'm going to talk about today is branding
Why it's necessary in your video and basically ways that you can do it
So as you can see guys I've got a bit of branding into this video
Branding is really important when you make any videos because you want people to remember you if you've got a logo that's memorable you've got a slogan that's memorable try and get it into your video
The easiest way, as you can see, is branded shirts
If you get your branded shirt in, if you've got a branded shirt put them on
Put your videos together using them it also means that you can make a sequence of videos at the same time not worry about looking the same because it's a branded shirt
You can also see that I've got my Clockwork Eye logo in there and because I've actually made these videos tailored for the Trades Hub members I've actually got a nudge there towards the Trades Hub by putting my certificate on the wall behind me
Now you can over do your branding so what I recommend is that you basically keep it nice and simple nice and subliminal and then don't over do it okay guys

Good morning Hank, it's Tuesday.
As you can tell from the gray speckled walls behind me, I am in an airport, and as you can tell from my cold dead eyes, it's 5:42 in the morning.
Also, I forgot my camcorder, so I'm filming this on my phone.
I have a bunch of things to tell you, but I also wanna give you some travel tips, so I'm gonna intersperse them.
Thing One Hank, The Paper Towns Movie: they moved the release date; it is now coming out on July 24th.
That is the real date; it will really come out on that day, I think.
That's very good news, because it means that Jake and everybody will have time to actually finish the movie.
Also, there is going to be a trailer soon.
How soon?
I can't tell you, but pretty soon.
Ok, travel tip: In almost every airport in the United States, there is a gate that is empty all the time.
In our case in Indianapolis, it's gate A3. This is where I come to make videoblogs, because there are no people here.
If you're at an airport, take the time to walk around and find the empty gate, because there are plugs, and chairs, and freedom.
Sadly that travel tip does not apply to people in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, or Atlanta.
Thing Two, The Looking For Alaska movie: So Hank, my first book, Looking For Alaska, came out 10 years ago, and the movie rights have been owned ever since by Paramount.

We’ve grown as people, me independent from them
I’ve stayed in Europe, spent Christmas here for some years instead of “going home" for Christmas to spend it with my parents


&gt;&gt; Our special interest group is SIG 6 and it's hearing and hearing disorders research and diagnostics and basically we look at the whole realm of hearing disorders, what causes them, how we test them, test for them, how we rehabilitate people who have hearing loss so pretty much the full gamut of working with hearing impaired people.
For me, it's really given me the opportunity to work with individuals that ordinarily would not have had an opportunity to work with; I currently work with people all across the country through the special interest group.
And so that's a great opportunity I believe and it's really helped my career and my professional growth.
It's really a way to stay up to date with what's going on in the field, if I need to talk to someone who knows more about some area than I do, I have ready access to them through the special interest group.

Now that we know stress refers to our perceived ability to meet the demands of a given situation, and we know how our body responds to stress, how is it that we handle stress?
Well, psychologists call our ability to handle or deal with stress, coping.

&gt;&gt; The big question that I think needs to be answered is how can we provide entrepreneurial education to poorest of the poor.
Access to education as we know it is no longer sufficient or valid, only access to education but education that has no quality does not produce any tangible results.
Many of the world's poor have access to education and in fact have been to third, sixth, ninth grade.
That has not changed anything so what they need is practical entrepreneurial education to everybody.
Welcome to Revelation Unraveled, I am your host, William Tapley, also known as the Third Eagle of the Apocalypse and the Co-Prophet of these End Times.
I have some very interesting news for you and that is that YouTube has unblocked my response video to Stephen Colbert and for me this is really amazing!
About four years ago, you may remember, Anderson Cooper put me on his Ridiculist and made fun of me for pointing out all the sexual symbolism in the Denver Airport murals.
And Stephen Colbert jumped on board about six months later and he attacked me on his program.
Now I went along with this.
In fact, they sent a crew up here to interview me and the reason I went along with it- I knew they were gonna do a hatchet job on me- and the reason I went along with this was because Anderson Cooper allowed me to do response videos here on YouTube.
However, as soon as I posted a response video to Stephen Colbert, he blocked my video.

where public space has to be fought for to begin with, and then for them to be successful, somebody has to think very hard about every detail
Now, open spaces in cities are opportunities
Yes, they are opportunities for commercial investment, but they are also opportunities for the common good of the city, and those two goals are often not aligned with one another, and therein lies the conflict
The first opportunity I had to fight for a great public open space was in the early 1980s, when I was leading a team of planners at a gigantic landfill called Battery Park City in lower Manhattan on the Hudson River
When it came to loans paying for school, a lot of my undergrad was paid for through student loans and I worked and paid as much as I could.

MARY GARRETT: The digital savvy is absolutely true.
And one of the phenomena we were recognizing is people are having that kind of an intimate reaction in their own personal experiences and in their consumer experiences.
They're not going to tolerate less than that in their professional experiences.
So I think as a B2B marketer, for example, you have to be able to know the individual client.
You can't get away with just pushing content out any longer.

I think we need to ask ourselves first, what is a superpower?
Can India grow in economic size?
Of course, it will grow.

But that’s OK, because some of today’s meditation is nature-themed
I want you to find your comfortable seat and that could be on a pillow on the floor, on your couch, in bed, whatever works for you
If you want to sit in a reclined position, that’s fine
But make sure that you’re not so relaxed that you fall asleep
You can achieve the perfect meditation posture by inhaling your shoulders up to your ears like so and exhaling your shoulder blades down along your spine
The crown of your head should be pointed toward the sky and your chin should be parallel to the floor
Today’s meditation is one for protection
So let’s keep our hands downturned on our knees or our thighs
Now close your eyes and start to pay attention to your breath as it is in this moment
Well, the Lendal bridge trial has clearly polarised opinion and it's   been discussed in the city since the early 70s The idea was to try and take out through traffic that's   not going to the city centre as a destination by trying to make sure there's more bus priority lanes so that people   can get on to public transport and get around more easily so it will be more reliable and they not get caught up in traffic but it's clearly polarised opinion and despite some very positive measures from   it been shown in bus patronage, bus reliability and air quality clearly there's been a negative reaction.
they often shared apartments, survival tactics, child care -- always knew how to fill one more belly, no matter how small the food available
But they were told that success meant leaving the village behind and pursuing that iconic symbol of the American Dream, the white picket fence
And even today, we see a white picket fence and we think success, self-possession
But when you strip away the sentimentality, what it really does is divides us
Many Americans are rejecting the white picket fence and the kind of highly privatized life that happened within it, and reclaiming village life, reclaiming interdependence instead

Hi this is Tom Andriola.
Today I'm going to talk to you about big date in health care, the VCR CIO summit, and about the next quarterly Town Hall coming up in May.
Yeah so health care, big data.
One of the big things that's going on in health care right now, it's becoming a big data industry and analytics are really driving the future of healthcare.
So we started an initiative to get everyone in UC talking about how do we combine the data from across the five health systems and six medical schools and find a way to use that data so that every patient gets the absolute best and most personalized care that they can possibly get.
And it's leading to a lot of exciting conversations and for us to look at opportunities that we never thought before possible.
The VCR CIO summit that we held in March down at UCLA was an opportunity for the IT community to engage about a hundred professors and faculty members from around the system.
They both have Oscars to show for their careers and they share the same birthday of September 25th
But one thing Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones don't share is the same generation
Douglas was born on the cusp of the Baby Boom in the '40s while Zeta-Jones was more of a flower child, born nearly three decades later in 1969
Nevertheless, the quarter-century gap wasn't a problem when these two married in 2000, and, despite a temporary split, they've made their marriage work ever since

Okay, we're talking about listening.
the Firebird was composed by Stravinsky in 1910 for a ballet of the same name.
It was then reorchestrated by him into smaller suites in 1911, 1919, and 1945 The one we're going to perform tonight is the 1919 version, which is the most frequently performed.
It was composed for the Russian Ballet Company in Paris and his incredible success lead Stravinsky to write subsequent works like Petrushka and the Rite of Spring.
The story deals with our hero, Ivan, who enters the magical realm of King Katchei the immortal.
There he sees the Firebird and he chases and captures the Firebird.
The Firebird agrees to help Ivan in exchange for its eventual freedom.
After that, Ivan sees 13 princesses and he falls in love with one of them.
A lot of Christians don't understand why it is that Jesus does not speak to them.
They feel blocked off from Jesus.
They feel that there is something blocking them from heaven.
Jesus gave me a word in prayer which I want to read to you; Too often people have walked away from me and sinned.
They have not heeded my call.
I have called them to come and serve me but they were not interested in heeding my call so I gave them over to a depraved mind to let them do what their desires dictate them to do...I am holy and to follow me, you must be holy.
The reason why you are blocked off from me, is because of your SIN.
Leave your sin, and focus on me.

Israel rejects the absurd decision of the ICC prosecutor.
It’s absurd for the ICC to ignore international law and agreements, Under which the Palestinians don't have a state and can only get one through direct negotiations with Israel.
The rules of the ICC are clear: No state  No standing  No case.
It’s absurd for the ICC to go after Israel, which upholds the highest standards of international law Our actions are subject to the constant and careful review of Israel's world-renowned and utterly independent legal system.
But this decision is even more preposterous given that Israel is legitimately defending itself against Palestinian terrorists who routinely commit multiple war crimes.
They deliberately fire thousands of rockets at our civilians, while hiding behind Palestinian civilians whom they use a human shield And here's the ultimate folly of this decision – It is the democracy of Israel, a world leader in fighting terrorism, which is to be hauled to the dock in The Hague, While the terrorist war criminals of Hamas are the ones who are going to be pressing the charges.
I won't be surprised if ISIS, al-Qaida and Hezbollah follow suit.
See, Hamas has already announced that they will join their Palestinian partner,  President Abbas, in filing complaints against Israel as a result of this decision.
Hi this is Laura Turner and today I'm going to talk to you about how to choose a topic for your senior thesis.

The CEO is of course a leader, and a mentor, and a coach for his company and basically has three fundamental jobs.
One, is to be the chief strategy officer of the firm, which means really setting the future course of the firm, where it's going, what the company's about.
The second one is to create, as the chief human relations officer, to create the kind of company and build the organization that can actually accomplish the strategy.
And finally it's the chief investor relations officer, the one who really relates to the board if he or she has one or to investors, the owners of the company, so that they understand what the company's about and can support it and allow it to happen.

Hi this is Rhett Reiger White Caspian studios on behalf of Expert Village.
I want to talk for a minute about the shoot in general.
Now this is the meat of being a director.
You are on the shoot.
I'm Principal Sisson and this is Associate Principal Marni Johnson
We are here to visit with you about the current state of Hersey High School
At this point in time our students are going to begin the registration process
So I thought I would invite Marni to talk to you all about what that entails so that you would have some idea of the decisions that you'll have with your children in the coming weeks and months
So it seems kind of crazy that at this time of year after we just started the new year that we are already talking about next year
Come November our current sophomores will start selecting their courses for next year including their elective courses and teachers are making recommendations for core classes for next year
Our counselors will be going into classrooms for each grade level distributing course material, talking about course selections and then they go through the process of meeting with every student individually and this takes place from November until January at which time then hopefully all of our students have selected courses
This is an important process because this helps drive our master schedule
Our master schedule is hopefully based off of what students needs and students wants are and we try to build a schedule that works most appropriately with all the requests that we receive
Our hope is that all kids get the courses that they wish for the following year
We have other things going on at Hersey as well that I would like to mention
We have our annual food drive that is about to take place which is an exciting time for Hersey
Our Service Over Self organization does a fantastic job with that effort and initiative
We have a lot of academic concepts if you will happening
We are looking at dual credit courses with Harper College which is an exciting concept for us
Where students could hopefully accumulate 15 credits over the course of their high school years which gives them a higher chance or probability of doing well in a college environment and so we're excited to be rolling those out with this registration process as well
I would encourage you to keep your children focused on the rest of the semester
It is a semester that's fractured with a lot of holidays and a lot of breaks in it
We need to finish the semester as well as we can
Stay focused, stay intent on your studies with all that goes on around you
A lot of great activities -- we are wrapping up our fall sports season
We are beginning our winter sports season
We have some outstanding efforts from our kids
We offer so many things for so many kids
Its real heartening to see the opportunities that you help provide for your children
So we thank you for that and we do our best to continue the work for your children that we find significant and important

In professional services, if what you're offering are small incremental improvements, then your clients are going to expect to pay small dollars for them
I've sort of come from a bit of a background in the public service and I think there's, in foreign policy, there's a bit of a disconnect between the foreign policy for public service and what happens in academia.
And I think that's what sort of drove my interest just to try and bridge that difference.
And I think the way to go about doing that is trying to make some of our foreign policy research actually practical for foreign policy practitioners.
So that's what's driving my research.
To actually make some recommendations as to how their processes can be improved, how the process of foreign policy making can be opened up, to incorporate other voices and other actors.
And also improve work for the big bureaucracy itself.

I started to see the militia appearing all around, probably more than fifty of them.
They could walk right between the bushes of the enclosure.
They could walk in whenever they wanted.
And it was after, like I said, two to three hours, that all of a sudden, here comes a little double-cab Toyota pickup with seven gendarmes in the back, in their little red berets.
What a welcome sight these guys were.

Hi, my name is Fan Li.
Or is this something that's just an artifact of our data, just statistical noise
Well, to answer that, we have to do some statistical inference
Now, in here, in these brackets, we see the number of observations in each group

So those numbers are pretty small, so that's why we might be worried that this number here is just statistical noise and is not an actual effect
So we're going to have to do the confidence interval for that, and that I've drawn right here
I've got our average treatment effect estimate of -0
We often get a question about how is my corporation or LLC going to be taxed at the federal government level.
The short answer with an LLC is a single member LLC defaults to disregarded status.
It doesn't mean it's a disregarded entity for liability reasons.
It means it's disregarded for tax reasons.
So in other words, there's no separate tax return to file for your LLC if you're a single member LLC.
All the income goes on the Schedule C of your personal 1040. Should you have a partnership which is a multimember LLC, then you will file a 1065 which is the federal partnership tax return.
One advantage of the LLC is it's allowed to do things called check the box.
So they can also elect, an LLC can elect, to an S-corporation status for tax reasons or a C-corporation for tax reasons.
So even though you still have an LLC, you can file a tax return with all the advantages of an S-Corp or a C-Corp, and it's amazing the flexibility you have with an LLC.
&gt;&gt; I was a resident in neurosurgery, and I was at Duke University, and I did an operation on a patient with one of my attending called deep brain stimulation.
And the next day, I was on my rounds, as residents are, and going into rooms and seeing how people are.
And I walked into this gentleman's room, and he was crying.
And at first, I was really concerned, because I was like, why is this patient crying?
And he looked at me, and I asked him, you know, Mr. So and So, why are you crying?
He said, well, you know, I just wrote the first letter I've written my granddaughter in 10 years.
Because he had something called essential tremor.
An essential tremor is a disease in which the harder you try to do something, the more your hand shakes.
And so he wasn't able to write a letter to his granddaughter.
And all of a sudden after this operation, he was able to.
Well, that really struck a chord, and I ended up a functional neurosurgeon who does deep brain stimulation.
After I finished my residency, I was looking for a place that was going to be able to combine all of my research interest with all of my clinical interest.
And so I looked at various fancy places on the East Coast and got a couple of really nice offers, actually.
And I was thinking hard about them.
Here's an idea, hurricanes are bad.
So Hurricane Sandy has passed.
I'm very lucky, I didn't even lose power or internet, but I am trapped in Brooklyn.
Mass transit is shut down, the mayor is telling people not to drive, so it might be a little while before the next Idea Channel gets posted.
So I thought I would make a fun little thing in my apartment here with my own fake Idea Channel wall.
But real Idea Channel updates might be a little slow.
And speaking of updates, um, I forget who it was, but I'll try to figure out and post a link in the description.
I saw a really interesting Twitter posted this morning from someone who's saying that they thought reading a trustworthy Twitter feed for five minutes is more informative than watching CNN for a whole half an hour.
And this made me realize that I actually spent the entire storm flipping back and forth between watching "Undeclared" on Netflix and reading Twitter.
And that when the mayor would come on I would flip on the broadcast news and watch him for as long as he was on TV, but for the most part, I was getting my news-- for lack of a better word-- from my friends who were living the storm and posting updates on the internet.
For the last very long time, I think that we think of news as something that's handed down from on high from like a broadcast network or something.
Staples are never recommended as a fastener for Western Red Cedar.
The next thing you want to look at is education and intellectual level.
And this is real important, not only for selecting your topic, but also widening your speech and the verbiage that you choose to present in your speech.
Are you going to be speaking to people who have PhD's or who have not even gotten completely through High School yet.
Now if we're talking about a college classroom, you've probably all got something in common.
You're all in college, so you're all working towards an education, you're all working towards an undergraduate degree.
And that makes things a little bit easier.

I just came from a meeting of the Israeli cabinet.
We discussed the proposed framework for a deal with Iran.
The cabinet is united in strongly opposing the proposed deal.
This deal would pose a grave danger to the region and to the world and would threaten the very survival of the State of Israel.
The deal would not shut down a single nuclear facility in Iran, would not destroy a single centrifuge in Iran and will not stop R&amp;D on Iran's advanced centrifuges.
On the contrary.
The deal would legitimize Iran's illegal nuclear program.
It would leave Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure.
A vast nuclear infrastructure remains in place.
The deal would lift sanctions almost immediately And this at the very time that Iran is stepping up its aggression and terror in the region &amp; beyond the region.
In a few years, the deal would remove the restrictions on Iran's nuclear program, Enabling Iran to have a massive enrichment capacity that it could use to produce many nuclear bombs within a matter of months The deal would greatly bolster Iran's economy.
It would give Iran thereby tremendous means to propel its aggression and terrorism throughout the Middle East.
Hi I'm Governor Tom Wolf I'm in Penn Treaty School in Philadelphia and this has been quite a week.
On Tuesday I kicked off the new budget session with my budget speech and basically what I talked about was just the honest truth.
We have a real budget crisis that we're facing here in Pennsylvania.
For years the outside rating agencies, the Independent Fiscal Office -- everybody's been saying we have not had a balanced budget.
We need to change that.
And I said that on Tuesday.
Once we balance our budget, we have to make sure that we're investing the dollars we raised wisely.
If we don't -- we don't invest wisely -- we're going to be hurting our schools, we're going to be hurting basically our future.
Now, there might thirty percent or so of the school districts in Pennsylvania who are wealthy enough that they don't have to worry about making ends meet.
They don't worry about the state doing its share in terms of education funding.
But, on average, Pennsylvania ranks 45th in terms of the state's share of funding for education.
That means in most school districts, the local areas -- the local taxpayers -- have to come up with the lion's share of support and in poorer areas they just don't get the support they need.
We need to have an education system that works all of us in Pennsylvania.
I'm from York County, I need Penn Treaty here in Philadelphia to work.
I was in Altoona, I was in Clairton -- those school districts have to work.

Welcome back to Film Producing 101 on behalf of Expert Village.
So the next topic we're going to talk about here is getting a few key crew members.
How to build a team so to speak.
The debt ratio tells us the proportion of assets financed with debt.
A debt ratio of 0.50 means that debt finances half the assets.
The higher the debt ratio the greater the pressure to pay interest and principal.
The debt ratio is a measure of solvency.
In general, a debt ratio of less than 30%  suggest a company isn’t as efficient as it could be,  whereas a ratio more than 75% , let's say,  suggests possible bankruptcy, if a company experiences a downturn in business.
The debt ratio is calculated as total liabilities divided by total assets.
It tells us what percentage of assets are financed with debt.
On average, most debt ratios are around 60%  as companies tend to finance more assets with debt than equity.
This is mainly due to debt tax advantages.
Interest expense is tax-deductible for businesses.
What to do about challenging audiences?
Well here's the first thing to know, most audiences aren't challenging.
Most audiences will become challenging if they're bored or if they feel that the presenter isn't on their side or delivering information that's of value to them.
But the fact is, most audiences want the presenter to do a good job.

Hey guys, Matt from Sales4U here If you have any reports to give to clients, if you have a service company, if you are building a product and you want to show the progress, the RAG report is going to be tremendously helpful
RAG stands for Red, Amber, Green, so three colours
The green is everything is good, it's been done
amber means it's in progress, red means it's urgent, there's something to address there's a problem, there's an issue, we're going to be late
That's a report that I send before the weekly call with the client
so usually the day right before the call just to give them an update of what's going on and left to do the progress that I made So I will send you the template for it if you want it, you can email me at matt@sales4u
BENJAMIN CARDIN: First, let me agree with Sen
Corker that it is not right for millionaires and billionaires to pay effective tax rates of 10 or 15 percent, when a laborer working 40 hours a week is paying at a 28 percent
So I think we can find some common agreement to make sure that everyone is paying their fair share of taxes
We can close some of these loopholes
And I also think we need to take a look at rates
On entitlement reform, we have already started down that path with the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare
We need to change the way we deliver health care in America
And in doing that, we reduce the cost of health care, we reduce the readmissions to hospitals, we do a better job on using technology, less tests
We manage the more complicated medical interventions
We reduce hospital infection rates
There's a lot of ways that you can reduce health care costs

VICTOR, FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICER, ECONOMIC CAREER TRACK: My name is Victor, I'm a Foreign Service Officer in the Economic career track.
I've always been interested in economic issues, especially economic recovery after some war or other type of crisis.
And with the Economic career track,  you get a chance to go overseas and report on whatever important economic issues are going on at that time.
So you get to be sort of like the Secretary of State's own "Financial Times" reporter, or something like that, which is really exciting to me, to be the eyes and ears of U.S.
decision makers.
My path to get into this career came through one of the Department's fellowship programs, the Pickering Fellowship.
I entered the undergraduate program in 2002, and the program included some summer enrichment opportunities, such as a domestic and an overseas internship.
I worked domestically at the office that deals with failed states, which really highlights my interest in economic recovery.
And then overseas, I worked in Ghana, a very exciting summer during the World Cup, and got a chance to cover economic issues related to arms smuggling.
Well I'm now in my second assignment.
My first assignment was as a Consular Officer in Hong Kong; it gave me a chance to see crises not on a... on a broad scale level, because Hong Kong is a very easy-to-live place, but on a... on a small-scale, personal level, because Consular Officers often see people who are in personal crises -- Americans who have been hospitalized or imprisoned abroad.
Now in my second assignment, I have the...sort of a global portfolio.
I'm a Watch Officer, so I work in the Secretary's of State's 24-hour operations center.
And our job is to keep decision makers informed about issues all... that are happening all over the world.
&gt;&gt; REBECCA BONDOR: One of the most significant things that happened to me here at Miami was I wrote a puppet script as a senior thesis, and the professor encouraged me to turn it into a full-out production.
So she said, why don't you partner with people in the Theatre Department?
So I recruited 4 actors as the puppeteers.
I built all the marionettes.
I built the stage.
And we had 3 weekend performances.
And this show was so successful that it gave me the confidence to write all of the puppeteer companies that were listed in The New Yorker magazine.
And lo and behold, one wrote me back and said, if I was willing to move all my stuff to New York at my own expense, I could work for them and tour the schools with their marionette company.
They were a well-established marionette company that paid.
So I said, oh, okay, that sounds like a good idea.
I love children's writing and if they'll let me, it'll be an opportunity to move to New York.

Hi, Mike Johnson from Vexxt Business Growth One of the things that I wanted to give you a tip on today is what we call the premium pricing option.
You always hear about upselling and adding to each customer's purchase.
But, sometimes people are leery of doing that.
They feel like they are coming on too strong if they ask someone to purchase something else.
This is Patrick Munro talking about current CD rates.
As a Financial Advisor I see financial rates and terms changing in this ever changing financial landscape.
We went on vacation to Brigantine New Jersey
We were walking with her on a boardwalk and there was a gentleman who was roasting peanuts
And they were blowing the smell of the peanuts out on the boardwalk
That was when she had her first full-fledged anaphylactic episode
A couple of months ago he went into anaphylaxis after drinking his older sister's regular milk
His stomach started to hurt and then he started to throw up
And we could hear her throat starting to close
I'm haunted by that sound
She told me you know you need to give her the EpiPen and uh it was the hardest thing I ever had to do
We kept second guessing ourselves but once his lip and his tongue started swelling, we knew that was it
Yeah, that we had to give it
We had no choice
He jabbed her with the EpiPen and uh she cried and he cried and I've never seen him cry it was just awful
I cried like a baby it was uh she looked at me like No Daddy, you know because I had to poke her with this needle
When the squad got there the guy was looking at him and said Oh yeah he looks fine now! No, still we gotta go to the hospital, you don't understand
shared success or something, so even something like yeah this all the things I appreciate in him, it's like I share a bit less of the joy or something
- Two of my best pieces of advice for musicians and creative people who want to share their work online and grow their audience and grow their engagement ^using digital strategy is to just start ^and not overthink it
^And this can apply to everything, whether it is sending an email blast to your list that you haven't talked to in two years or starting a YouTube channel, or running an ad campaign for your next record that's coming out, just start
I think a lot of us have a tendency to sit and wait and wonder and worry and research and talk to everybody we know to get their input and try to figure out the right way to do it and then you look back and months have passed and you still haven't done the thing that you want to do
And so by just starting it, you actually are moving forward and you're seeing what works and the great thing about these digital tools is you get stats right away, you can see who's responding on social media or you can see if anyone's actually clicking on your ad, if anyone's actually buying the thing you want them to buy
You get the stats right away, it's great
Even if you have a total crash and burn ad campaign, you learn a lot from it and your next one's gonna to be better
^And once you get started, just keep going
^It can definitely take the wind out of your sails if you've put money into an ad campaign for the first time or you've spent a lot of time on an email and you've sent it out to your huge list and there's no response or the response isn't what you wanted
It can be really disappointing and so it's hard to try again if it didn't have the response that you wanted it to have
So just keep going
Ways that I keep going with my projects and I advise to my clients is just ^this concept of accountability
^How can you hold yourself accountable to do the goals that you want? Because we all sort of by default, if things get stressful, don't do stuff
And so how can you kind of trick your brain to make it happen? Accountability, and one way that I've done that ^is to just set a schedule
^And maybe for social media, it's saying that you want to post to Twitter eight times a week or you want to post a new YouTube channel once a week
Set a schedule that seems reasonable for you and then just do it
^Accountability can also come from ^a connection with another person
^This could maybe be your publicist or your manager, if you have the relationship where you're talking regularly, check in and have them sort of hold you responsible that you get stuff done before your next call with them and it's sort of like you've got that assignment
But if you don't have that, you could also just create that with other members of your ensemble, maybe you delegate who works on which things and you have a weekly check in meeting amongst all of you to see if everybody's doing what they need to be doing and how you can do better the next week
Or just a colleague or a friend who's doing similar work
You can get on the phone once a week
I really think that weekly calls or even just a few times a month can be really helpful with checking in and making sure you're staying on track with what you want to do
So I talk to people all day long about the power of online video to share your story with the world and so I'm taking my own advice here ^and starting this new YouTube channel
^Hello, I'm Adrienne Stortz, this is my new YouTube channel about digital marketing strategy for musicians
^So as you've been watching this video, ^what's the thing that popped into your brain that you have been wanting to just start but you've been putting off or making excuses or over-researching? Leave it in the comments, let me know what it is, and let me know what the one thing you're going to do towards starting that this week is in the comments as well
^So get started and please do subscribe as well ^so you can check in with these videos every single week and I can give you advice and we can do this
Thank you for watching and I'll see you next time

Hi guys, Bridget from Money After Graduation here and I wanted to talk to you about getting started investing
So many young people stay out of the stock market because they're intimidated by its complexity or they think they don't have enough money to get started investing
And as a result they miss out on hundreds of thousands of dollars of potential returns over their lifetime
You can't afford not to invest if you want to enjoy any kind of long term financial security
Thankfully, there's a lot of options available to you to get started no matter what your situation or understanding of the market
The first and easiest way to get started investing is mutual funds
These are typically available directly from your bank and you can start with as little as $50
In a mutual fund, you're actually giving your money over to a fund manager who invests it in a series of stocks or other investments on your behalf
As a result, mutual funds typically come with some higher fees, but it really takes the load off you doing the stock picking individually so it might be a good option for you
When you're selecting mutual funds, look very closely at the fees so you know exactly how much you're paying
These fees will be listed as the MER or "mer" fee, and you want to try to stay around 1%
A lot of mutual funds will have these fees as high as 3% or 4%
Stay away from those, you can't afford to have that much of your return eaten up by fees
If you have a little bit more money to invest, and want to pay less fees, your next choice is a roboadvisor
These are awesome online wealth management tools that you need about $1,000 to get started in a portfolio
All you need to do is deposit your money, and they take care of the rest, just like a mutual fund, except for at a much lower cost
For a roboadvisor, you can typically expect to spend somewhere between 0

Finally, the last option to get started investing is to open your own brokerage account
If you bank with a large financial institution they might be able to offer you their own brokerage account but otherwise you might have to look for an online brokerage provider
When you have a brokerage account, your actually responsible for doing all the investing yourself
This means you have to choose your stocks and ETFs, you have to decide when to buy and sell, and your responsible for managing all your taxes and so on
If that sounds like too much work, then the roboadvisor or the mutual funds are probably a better option for you, but if you want to be more in control of your money and pay the least amount of fees possible, then a brokerage account is the right fit
To get started, you'll only need about $1,000 and you can begin trading right away
If you want to learn how to invest in the stock market there's plenty of different resources online and off that you could use
There's plenty of investing books and I'll leave some in the description below so you can know some of my favorites that I learned to get started in the stock market
I also offer a series of investing eCourses that will help you as well
It's also not uncommon for investing classes to be offered as part of adult continuing education at local universities, so make sure to check those out as well
I hope you guys found this video helpful and are feeling a little more confident about looking at your investing options
Really remember the only investing mistake you can make right now is not investing at all

- So, we're very excited about this program
It's a necessary program
We're seeking $18 million in the budget this year to help this program be replenished, first of all, the $15 million dollars from the health and foods fund
It's been a great program for us in the Rochester region
Foodlink has done a great job up there serving underserved areas with fresh fruits and vegetables
We have a terrible obesity problem, especially among children
1/3 of children are obese in the state of New York
It costs us billions of dollars annually, so we want to do everything we can to make those fresh fruits and vegetable options available to young people and adults in those underserved areas, those people who can't and don't have the transportation to get to Wegmans or to get to Tops
It's very important, it's critical

are never going to buy you're products
To fix that, you need to go back to this essential exercise which is your customer profile
I linked below the video to a free workbook that you can download to help you really get it right
It's important because once you've done this exercise, you will be able pick the right keywords to attract the right type of customers, the type that's ready to click on the buy button to your handmade store
The second element we need to look into is your product images, and that is the most important thing you can do online to get more sales
The reason for that is simple
People can't touch and can't actually see your products, and they're buying according to what they see on the pictures

Hi, I’m Steve Freeman with GreatBusinessContent

Lately I’ve been blogging about building a customer base from scratch
What follows is my interview with Bret Tuck co-owner of Edely’s Bar-b-que in Nashville Tennessee
Bret talks about how he defined his customer base, and then developed a product line to keep them coming back
Let’s listen to what Bret has to say
After I got done with business school I sat down with my parents and told them that I actually wanted to learn a trade, versus just information on how to make money
So, that’s when I decided to go to culinary art school
The reason I chose to get into a bar-restaurant or this style is because I know I can cook well
I was in fine dining for a long time
So I took the fine dining attitude to making stuff taste good, plate presentation and all that stuff
Then, tone it down so you can put a really good tasting meal on a plate for a decent price
I think with that concept, especially with the way the American cuisine is going, I think that’s just a hit concept
That your client or your customers are just a huge wide base
I think that’s where a lot of restaurants get into trouble is cause they shoot for either fine dining, where only this style of people will come in, or they shoot for the Subway Franchise, which that all still make money in certain ways, and they get that low income customer coming in and quality and stuff is an issue
Versus high end where quality is not the issue, , just the amount of people who are going to be able to pay for it
I think you take those skills and you come up with a concept that really reaches the customer whether it’s a family with young kids or whether it’s a family with college kids, whether it’s college kids, 35 year olds and up, and all the way up to seniors, senior citizens
This concept really hit all of them
So literally we have times during the day that at 5:00 you have young children with their parents coming in from about 5:15 to 5:30 – 6:30
Then about 6:30 to 7:30 we have that middle age group comes in and then, or I’m sorry the elderly come in and then come around 8:00 you get all the college come in that want to have a beer and dinner
Thanks Bret, good information
Did you find this information useful? If so please comment below, we can get a conversation going

My name is Roni Ballas, 24 Years old
going to start my degree in the IDC this year
In the last two years I have been focusing on building myself
I got to a high position in a technological organization, but something is still missing
I can talk about my experience as I previously did on the format attached However, I would rather use this time in order to give you a sneak peek into my head
When I was young my mother told me that the only way to achieve the impossible Is first to believe it is possible
from this moment forward, I have been dreaming to change the world
I believe that with the technology we have today we can find a way to live among nature and not instead of it
In order to fulfill my dream, I need your help
I need knowledge, guidance and atmosphere of people that wakes up every morning knowing that they can make a difference in this world
thats exactly what I was missing
Entrepreneurship holds inside leadership, hunger for creation but most importantly The ability to fail without losing your enthusiasm
I have known myself 24 years and i have no doubt, my place is between the IDC walls
You have known me for 58 seconds

Let’s take a look at how Mario has made history, specifically, how we owe Mario and Nintendo a huge credit for resurrecting the video game industry
A pop culture icon, the moustachioed plumber hit the scene as jump man in Donkey Kong, and later was renamed to Mario, getting his own arcade game in 1988, Mario Bros

Through tactics like guerrilla marketing, Nintendo managed to go from having developing 5 arcade games to blowing up in 1985, and even further in 1987 thanks to Super Mario Bros

We sometimes lose that balance

So I was luck enough to get two jobs on my placement year.
The first was in the South of France, in a place called Po, near to Biarritz, which was great to have the beach and then the mountains so...best of both worlds.
And there I was working for Total, which is a massive oil company as an English Language Assistant, so I was doing a lot of Business English and a lot of one-on-one conversations.
But I also got the chance to do a lot of  administration work, a lot of daily office jobs and there I was using French on a daily basis, not only having to talk to my colleagues but also to my flatmates, who were French and to other staff at Total, so it was really, really good experience for that.

[Transit timing variations in Kepler data] [100 Year Starship Symposium - Sept 2013, Houston] [Jill Tarter] [SETI Institute, Bernard M.
Oliver Chair for Research] Unfortunately the Kepler spacecraft can no longer manage precision pointing because of the loss of reaction wheels.
Nevertheless, we are still going to gain an enormous amount of additional information about exoplanets from the Kepler data that have been downloaded from the spacecraft but have not yet been processed through the pipeline that actually identifies exoplanets.
There's about another 4 quarters, another year of data to go through the pipeline, and I'm sure there are many, many more planets to be discovered in that pipeline.

So that the doors start-ups with Blockchain are working with the financial institutions here in the US directly
However, in Japan, we didn’t have a lot of ATS, DOCS POS yet
We didn’t have such experts who know both about financial institutions and technology, but we have an expert who knows about technology a lot
So, what NRI does is we’re going to be the intermediate between the start-ups, who know about technology, and also financial institutions
So that they know three of us can work together and to build a good proof of concept project
So one of the examples we are going right now is we have studied with the POC with Nomura Securities in October 2015 and that’s for a capital market
Hi, I am going to review 3 180 Cosmetics products
The first one is this Hyaluronic Acid serum
The second one is the C Booster serum, Vitamin C Booster serum
The third one is the moisturizing day cream
First of all, let me say, I have a fairly dry skin and that means that because of that in the T-area of my face I notice how my pores just seem bigger than the pores in the other parts of my face
And I've tried several moisturizers which were OK
And than I've encountered this serum
So in about 5 days of using it, I've used it twice daily, it managed to even out my skin tone and make the pores seem less visible
And it absorbs beautifully, very fast
You put it on and your skin just drinks it up
It is not heavy, it's not oily or sticky or icky in any way, it's very light but at the same time works very well in tightening your skin up, so I love it! The second serum is the C Booster - ummm, which again by the way got absorbed very quickly and is not oily at all, makes my skin feel very hydrated and less thin so to speak
It kind of renews it and fills it with moisture
And the skin just feels smooth and hydrated and silky
And the day moisturizing cream works great for me because, well I have dry skin and I need a fair amount of moisture
I put it on after the serum in the morning
It has both Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid in it by the way
So it kind of finishes of the facial treatment and it boosts the moisture up
And it lasts throughout the day, which is important for me because I don't have to worry about moisturizing my skin until the evening treatment
I really enjoy these products
I recommend them, especially if you would like to firm your skin up or if you have a more dry type of skin, like I have
So, this serum is just like a moisture injection for your skin, leaves your skin firm, hydrated and relaxed and comfortable and together with the day cream also radiant and it finishes of the treatment very nicely, like I've said

PETER: Hi, I'm Peter Norvig, Director of Research at Google
I would like to share some exciting things that we're doing at Google regarding online education

The first thing to think about here is that they are three interactivity types ... You have student to student interactivity, student to content interactivity and student to instructor interactivity.
Most of the time in an online course the student to content interactivity is assumed.
But student to student relationships and student to instructor relationships aren't always assumed.
Establish these within the first week of class.

The majority of our kids now-a-days are hands-on They want to work with their hands They want to see a tangible result right then and there and with textiles they can see it from beginning to all the way through the making, the molding and then the finished - the final product And they have a tangible result to be proud of and say heh I did that!

MARY ANN BELLIVEAU: We get asked a lot who we think the typical health consumer is online at Google.
And I think what we're realizing today is that there is no typical health consumer online.
That everyone is online and that health is an area that people have great concern about.
And so, where we can see how people take action around online interests such as shopping, or travel by booking hotels and flights and purchasing items.
With health, it's really different in terms of how they engage.
TODD WATSON: I think there's a number of key trends that we're seeing in marketing, and I think they have significant implications in terms of how both marketers and consumers react to those.
I think, first of all, this notion of the consumer being more in control means that the marketer, by definition, is going to have less control.
I think the implications for that one are particularly profound, because we're a whole industry that's been typically focused on our ability, as the marketer or the advertiser, to control the message from design development through to production and distribution.
I think that's starting to change very dramatically.
And I think it has changed.
So I think that the consumer, on the other hand, because they're more in control, they have the opportunity to shape their destiny.
To shape the messages they receive.
Hello, my name is Emily Gasner, and I'm with Working Solutions, and I'll be talking about how to be creative when you're looking for financing for your business.
So one of the things that entrepreneurs are, is they are very creative in terms of their products, service, but also in terms of getting the money that they need to start their business and grow their business.
So how can you do that?
One of the things that you can do is find out if there's anyone that you know in your community, maybe it's a friend, family member, someone you used to work with, someone that's real excited about your business idea, that might want to either give you some money, take some ownership in your business and invest the money into the business, become a business partner with you--I see a lot of times people find business partners to fund their businesses.

Do   the interest rates on your debt affect you decision?
Hey, this is Ken from AES.
Today we're going to talk about student engagement.
We talk to teachers all over the country, and one thing we hear over and over again is that it's harder to engage the students today.
It's harder to get them interested, keep them engaged, and have them sort of take that extra step that's often required to master the learning materials.
I personally feel that the key to student engagement is in varied instruction.
For example, we sell a digital curriculum, but I would never put the students on the computer day after day, hour after hour and have them work through the lessons.
What I'd recommend is mixing it up, so you want to use some lecture, you want to use some PowerPoints, you want to give the students some worksheets to fill out.
BETTY ANN BOWSER: Spanish soap operas, or telenovelas, are one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the world, with an estimated audience in the tens of millions
But the Latino audience in the United States has very high rates of obesity, diabetes, HIV, and asthma
More than 30 percent of American Hispanics also have no health insurance
When executive producer Jesus Fuentes came to the United States from Mexico City, he was struck by how little Hispanic people knew about health care
So he came up with the idea for "Crossroads
" JESUS FUENTES, "Encrucijada": Soap operas are very powerful to deliver a message
The challenge was to add medical information to that, to create the message that has -- that people can believe in that, and not trying to oversell it
Orlando certified public accountants work on many types of financial problems.
Taxes come in many forms.
Direct taxes are those which are assessed against income and property, both real and personal, and are paid straight to the government.
Indirect taxes are those which are assessed when a product or service is purchased or used.
These taxes are collected through an intermediary, such as a retail business.
Any governmental assessment, according to tax law, upon transactions, duties on imports from foreign countries, property value, estates of the deceases and licenses granting an income or right is considered to be a tax.
Congress was given the right to tax citizens in 1913 by the Sixteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.
States may also impose taxes.
The taxes to be paid in any state are governed by the state itself.
Florida doesn't have state income taxes.
The goal of any tax is to generate revenue for a government, be it federal, state, local or in Orlando.
This election is about the essence of America.
My name is Pat Iyer, I am the President of the Pat Iyer Group.
I've been a Legal Nurse Consultant since 1989 I mentor nurses who want to become legal nurse consultants.
Here are some common issues that I fix when I proofread the reports other legal nurse consultants.
You can save yourself a lot of time and present a polished work product by using these tips when you're preparing reports.
Here are eight tips.
One, you may spell out dates in words or in numbers.
For example, the day could be written as or 3/4/10. Both are correct but be consistent.
Pick one system in a report and stick with it.
Two, use complete sentences.
Hi, I'm Seth - The Guitar Guy.
Over the years I've been asked a lot of questions regarding learning to play the guitar.
You have a dispute with a business entity and you find out that you are going to be in binding arbitration.
Hi, I'm Robert Todd and I'm here to explain what is binding arbitration.
Hi, I’m Danielle from Put a Finish on It, and I’m a freelance copyeditor
What is a copyeditor? Basically put, a copyeditor is someone who works toward making a piece of writing error free
A lot of times when someone has finished writing something, they’ll say, will you proofread this? Or, will you edit this? Editing and proofreading are actually different from each other and from copyediting, even though we all understand that the author wants you to go through her work and correct errors and typos
And just to make things really clear, there is some overlap between proofreading, editing, and copyediting
An editor is concerned with the manuscript as whole
If it’s a work of fiction, then its plot structure, its character development, its world-building, its general believability, all that kind of stuff
Reorganizing or restructuring a manuscript is called developmental editing, and if a manuscript needs a lot of rewriting or revision, it needs substantive or content editing
Proofreaders are tasked with making sure that errors are not introduced to a text as it moves from its original copy through its iterations to its final published version
While proofreaders are expected to catch typos, they also scrutinize formatting, including line and word breaks, and the type specifications, such as font for headings versus subheadings
It’s about the actual print on the page
So we’ve gone from focusing on the story with developmental editing to focusing on the actual print with proofreading

According to The Copyeditor’s Handbook author Amy Einsohn, the goal of the copyeditor is to ensure clarity, coherency, consistency, and correctness, all in service of communication
This means that copyeditors perform mechanical editing, making sure that a manuscript conforms to a specific editorial style, or, if you work for a publishing house, a house style
Much of the publishing world uses The Chicago Manual of Style as their editorial style guide
Editorial style includes rules for spelling, hyphenation—is a word open, closed, or hyphentated-- capitalization, punctuation, like whether or not to use the serial, or Oxford, comma—and why would you not—treatment of numbers and numerals, and treatment of quotations to name the major ones
Copyeditors make sure all these elements are consistent throughout a manuscript so we don’t have numbers spelled out over here and in numerical form over there, or the same term capitalized on one page and lowercased on another
In addition to mechanical editing, copyeditors also perform language editing, correcting grammar, syntax, and diction
I’ll make sure the correct word is used, and that the sentence means what you want it to mean
And if there’s any question about the author’s intended meaning, I’ll ask
Here are a couple things I learned while earning my certification in copyediting

Got that, Siri? And 'irregardless?' Not a word at all
The en dash exists—it has very specific uses and it is not the same as a hyphen or dash
And according to the Chicago Manual of Style, "With the exception of proper nouns and compounds formed by an adverb ending in ly plus and adjective, it is never incorrect to hyphenate adjectival compounds before a noun
" And we usually do not hyphenate after the noun
So we have 'a snow-white dress,' but, 'the dress is snow white,' or, 'a very well-read child,' but, 'the child is well read
' I recently read that editing “requires an aptitude, both inherent and acquired, for reading
” I love the idea that reading ability is both inherent and acquired
I do have an inherent aptitude for reading, and an acquired one as well
I majored in English and history in college, and both those majors taught me to read critically, with purpose and focus, and a questioning mind
And that’s what I still do as a copyeditor
Experienced writers will tell you—don’t edit your own manuscript! You’re too close to it to see it critically
You’re so familiar with the writing that your eye won’t see a mistake and instead will read it as you expect it to be
Of course the language and descriptions are clear to the author—they come from the author’s own mind
The copyeditor will let the author know if there’s potential for something to be misread in addition to ensuring a consistent editorial style
As a copyeditor, I commit myself to a manuscript and enjoy the fine-tuning
O.K., a monologue is memorized, which is different than maybe you've been assigned prose or poetry or extemporaneous speaking or manuscript speaking before.
This is memorized which means you have no notes, you have no cue cards, you have no nothing.
All of it has to memorized.
And it is imperative that it is memorized, you could do it in your sleep.
You know, you don't even have to think about it.
Because what happens when you go into performance or you go in and do this monologue in front of other people, that element of the person will totally throw you.
And if the monologue is not memorized solidly, you'll lose your place, you'll be floundering for words.
It is written that we should NOT be unequally yoked with unbelievers, NOR does light have ANY fellowship with darkness.
IF we are to be children of God, we have to be separate from ungodly people.
We cannot do as they do or share in their pleasures, we cannot be part with them whatsoever.
This is a VERY difficult message because even in your own family may be ungodly.
And even in your own family or your own friends or peers may be influencing you to be part of the world.
To come out and to be separate from these people may cost you all your relationship and your reputations.
I don�t know what you would have to do come out and be separate so that you could truly follow God as your Father.
BUT what I DO know is IF YOU ASK FOR THE HOLY SPRIT, IF YOU PRAY AND SEEK OF THE LORD JESUS, HE WILL GUIDE YOU BY HIS HOLY SPIRIT AND HE WILL TEACH YOU WHAT YOU MUST DO.
He is a teacher that is NOT like an earthly teacher, He doesn�t give earthly wisdom as men and women give wisdom.
But He teaches in a way that leads us and guides us, He speaks directly to our spirit.
And if you want to be separate and truly a child of God you will accept the Holy Spirit.
You will pray and you will ask Jesus to give you the gift of the Holy Spirit.
And He will teach you and He will show you all things and show you even things that are to come.
We're talking about evaluating a speech, and the next thing that we have to look at are the elements of presentation.
The first thing that you want to look at is in regards to the language.
you are welcoming different points of view, different understandings, differing language
So if I was to pick one of those, let's say
okay let's pick a whopper just for fun
The whole conception of what research actually is
That is a wonderfully contentious issue within the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning
So I've written a chapter for book edited by Kathleen Mckinney, and the chapter, I think the chapter is called "Square One: What Is Research
" That fundamental question, a question that you're not going to see asked in physics now
But I work in medical education where a number of my colleagues believe the gold standard is a randomized control trial
That to them is research
Hello It's Lorraine Tilbury again, I'd like to develop a bit more the theme that I'd like to present at the TEDx Tours event.
in other words, non-predatory leadership as it's practiced by horses and how that concept can be interesting to apply to the human environment.
It's bit like "horses whispering to people" to evoke the film with the title "the horse whisperer", in this case it's the other way around... it's inspired by the observation of many great leaders such as Winston Churchill, Buddha, Alexander the Great, George Washington, the 1st American president.... all these great leaders were also excellent horse riders, and often rode horses that only they were able to ride.
The agency used to be even more siloed than we were, right?
So there was your traditional TV agency and then there was the radio and the newspaper and the media was siloed like that as well.
Hi, I’m Trista Harris from the Headwaters Foundation for Justice.
I really encourage you to come to the Finance and Sustainability Conference this year.
There’s a lot of different ways that you can learn how not to just make it through these tough financial times, but really how we can thrive and learn from our peers together.
If you want to form a non-profit corporation, the incorporation process is often similar to a for-profit corporation, but there are some important differences to be aware of.
First, create a clear plan before incorporation.
Understand what your non-profit organization will be, what societal need you’re addressing.
The clearer, more developed your purpose, the easier the incorporation process will be.
You also need to figure out a fundraising plan.
Think about who the typical donor will be for the organization, and what your plan is to solicit donations and develop a reliable source of donations.
When it comes time to incorporate, most non-profit organizations incorporate in the state they operate in.
First, you’ll need to choose a business name and check for availability.
You must also file your Articles of Incorporation with the appropriate state office, usually the Secretary of State.
A non-profit corporation, like any other corporation, should also create bylaws detailing the operation of the corporation.
Specify how the business will be run, who makes the decisions, how decision-makers are selected, and other important issues.
For the Foundation we think about it in a number of different ways
We think about how do we derisk, how do we work with private sector partners to derisk their interest and their capital allocation toward these markets
And we can use our investment tools to do that
We can use, you know, whether it’s a guaranteed, a derisk, a market or whether it’s providing equity investments, you know, to go into a new opportunity
We can think about using our capital to derisk
The other thing that’s really important is getting people to talk to each other
So, you know, the donor markets, the government markets are a big opportunity for companies
You know we’ve got companies like all of the big pharmaceutical companies providing vaccines and providing commodities and providing different types of products into these markets
The last thing you want to do is take all of this information that you have learned about your audience, all of their environmental factors, you have hopefully learned about their attitudes, their beliefs, their values, and you want to turn that into something that's empathetic.
Now what I'm talking about is, as you pick your topic, as you write your speech, as you present your speech, I want you to put yourself in the position of the audience.
You know people will think you have gone MAD if you say you hear from JESUS.
The Christians will say you're hearing a voice in your head and it's a demon.
They say you have a "more sure" knowledge of God in the Bible, but if you hear from God in a vision or a dream or if HE speaks to you while you are praying, that's probably a demon.
They have NEVER heard from Jesus and they will discourage you from hearing from Jesus and they will despise prophecies.
They test the Spirit of GOD against their own knowledge, but they accept the voice of demons as the voice of truth.
They discourage anyone from truly hearing from Jesus.
It is VERY rare that you will hear someone actually encourage you to hear the voice of the Living God, to hear the Holy Spirit and to OBEY HIM!
Most people that hear from God many NEVER EVER have anyone encourage them, because everyone around them is on the devils team, and discouraging anyone to actually hear from Jesus.
You know other Christians may encourage you to go to church.
And they certainly do encourage everyone to read the Bible.
But they do NOT encourage people to receive the Holy Spirit and to actually hear from Jesus.
That's the science of immunizations
Still, not everyone is convinced
Saying that vaccines and one size fits all and its for your own protection

And I feel that people have the right to choose
They need to educate before they vaccinate
Susan Love is the co-director of the Pennsylvania Medical Freedom Alliance
She believes there is a direct link from her daughter Sarah's autism, to the measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine, Sarah received at 15 months
She was meeting all of her milestones up until that point
She was starting to speak
Then after she got the vaccine she had a fever of 105

My name is Julie Asti.
I'm a certified financial planner, with Asti Financial Management, and today, I'm going to tell you, talk about how to select a good mutual fund.
How to select a good mutual fund.
That's really a loaded question, because there are so many dynamics that go into deciding which mutual fund is going to be right for your specific situation, but I'm going to just take a look at the top level, how do you actually select a good mutual fund?
You are looking at Absorb Health's D-Ribose Powder.
First discovered in 1891, D-Ribose is an important component of ATP, the body's main energy-storage molecule.
It has been found to be cardioprotective, decrease symptoms of fatigue, and increase total work output in exercise-trained males.
Hi this is Jessica Smith and this is how a household budget works.
Many Americans do not have a household budget let alone know how one works so they're wondering why at the end of the work they don't have money to spend or they're wondering why they are going in debt.
Well if you don't know how much income you have and how to disperse it evenly obviously you're not going to have enough at the end of the month.
So it is very critical to set a budget.

Hello and welcome to Easy Food Dehydrating's Video Newsletters!
Welcome to step 5 which is Conditioning Dehydrated Food ... by Susan Gast The conditioning of dehydrated food is a step often missed but not on purpose but out of the fact of not knowing about it!
When we have dehydrated our fruits and vegetables, it's time to let them cool down on the trays and then put them in some Ziploc™ bags - use the good bags - not sandwich bags and zip them closed!
Let the bags set out overnight on your kitchen counter top.
If you live in an extremely warm climate like I do, please be on the safe side and put your bags in refrigerator overnight.
The following day,  open your bags and feel for moisture.
On my website I tell you exactly what to expect for each food and to know when it's appropriately dehydrated and when it's too damp!
If it is damp, please stick it back on the dehydrator and dehydrate until it's properly dried.
The aim of the Ziploc™ bags is to help any remaining moisture distribute evenly among the bag's contents.
Mushrooms are the most difficult vegetable to tell whether they are properly dried - bear in mind mushrooms are dehydrated at two different temperatures to begin with go check out the website about mushrooms.
Mushrooms need to be very dry before they are vacuum sealed and stored away.
If a second go-around is deemed necessary on the dehydrator, don't forget to use the Ziploc™ bags again overnight and check them out again the day after.
Yes I know it's a lot of work but I want you to make sure that your food is dried properly and I don't want you to run the risk of mold growth in your stored foods just because they were too damp!
Just a quick note here - yes I do re-use the Ziploc™ bags because they're not cheap but I never re-use a Ziploc™ bag that has had meat in it.
Hi, my name is Karen Abby, I am a Legal Nurse Consultant Certified and a Certified Nurse Life Care Planner.
I've known Pat Iyer for   over 10 years.
I've attended many of her lectures.
One of her most significant lectures for me was on report writing.
One of the things I learned many years ago from her was not putting two spaces  between sentences when I am writing on the computer.
Social Anxiety Disorder is one of the group of anxiety disorders, and as the name implies, it's used to identify individuals who have difficulty interacting with other people because of excessive anxiety.
They're overly concerned about being judged and they develop physical and psychological manifestations of their anxiety that are so extreme that they avoid social situations.
And by social situations, I mean any situation that involves potential scrutiny by other people.
Any situation where other people may judge them, but it's less of a situation of being worried about the judgement and more of a situation of developing such intense physical and psychological feelings of anxiety that are so unpleasant, that as I said, these individuals avoid these situations.
In terms of treatment, the most effective kinds of treatments is a combination of treatments.
The next principle we should talk about is automation.
Whenever you write a piece of code to perform a task that otherwise you do by hand, that counts as automation.
There are a lot of steps of both development and operations processes that can be automated.
One big one is deployment, setting up a server to run an application.
Once upon a time, sysadmins would spend a lot of time setting up physical servers individually.
And when you needed to install software upgrades, you'd log into each machine and run the upgrade.
Now smart operations people would automate as much of this as possible, like throw together a shell script that logs into each server and runs the upgrade.
Hi, I am J and today’s topic is “EMC E20-361 exam and its preparation” first of all I will discuss about E20-361 exam related skills and technologies.
Afterwards I will share my personal experience how you can reduce your chances of failure in EMC E20-361 exam which is related to “EMC Network Attached Storage (NAS)” and credits towards “EMC Network Attached Storage (NAS) for Implementation Engineers” Certification.
Not every manufacturing businesses has state-of-the-art facilities and equipment
Sometimes this causes the insurance company, through the risk-control process, to penalize your rate, weaken coverage, or force you to spend money on facility improvements
So let me explain a few things about the risk control process, and then I’ll offer a key solution
When you begin the policy period, someone from the insurance company, from the risk control department, comes out and does an inspection of your property
They’re looking for anything in your property that could increase the chance for a claim
Maybe your fire extinguishers haven’t be tested in a few years, or the fire sprinkler system is older and increases the risk for a leak and subsequent water damage, or maybe your inventory is arranged in a way that increases the chance for fire to spread
Insurance companies can be very punitive in response to a poor risk-control visit


penalizing your rate, weakening coverage, or forcing you to spend money to make improvements
So how do you deal with this situation? The best way to handle this problem is to never have a problem
And by that, I mean - Be strategic in choosing your insurer, and opt for one that is more relaxed on risk-control standards
Someone in your office may have some expertise in this area
If not, I’m a free resource
are really dying and it's not good
Well, since I'm so dependent on my parents, I realize it's hard for them to always, we live paycheck to paycheck so its hard to always make sure that we're ok and stable
That influx in tuition either forces them [Students] to live with their parents or they have to get cheaper and cheaper housing in poorer neighborhoods and get two or three jobs so when you go to school you're tired and you don't want to learn
So it creates an environment of overall dissatisfaction
This is Jessica Smith on the benefits of investing in certificates and deposits.
When you're young, you need to start investing in certificates and deposits.This allows you to build a reference with the bank.
With the bank this is the first asset you're able to have.
Yes, role models are very important for the Middle East, because we are living in a society where young people are looking out for feed back from the actions of models.

The United States lacks the comprehensive policies needed to develop the most valued American commodity of all: good jobs.
Thank you for joining us for The Tradex Foods "3-Minute Sustainability Recap" A summary of hot news items in sustainability – for seafood purchasers and industry.
The following information is a rundown of key sustainability news items for the month of October.
------First up, the number of retailers committed to sustainable seafood keeps on growing: Target announced that it will only sell sustainable and traceable seafood by 2015. And the first African retailer – Pick n Pay –- has made a similar commitment.
Pick n Pay is South Africa’s second largest retailer.
And finally, the infamous Pike Place Market in Seattle will be dropping their iconic mascot – the monkfish – along with other unsustainable species as a part of their new policy to source only sustainable seafood.
------Next up – Russia made some headlines in seafood sustainability this month: The World Wildlife Fund - and Fisheries Holding Karat have agreed to develop educational programs on sustainable fisheries.
The aim is to increase knowledge amongst fishing crew members and fishing companies of sustainable fisheries and the requirements for environmental certification according to the MSC.
And, McDonalds is considering the launch of a Pollock processing factory in Russia.
The factory would produce filet-of-fish sandwiches out of Alaska Pollock sourced from MSC-Certified fisheries in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea.
This is contingent on the Russian fisheries obtaining the MSC eco-label.
And in Germany, two supermarket chains have launched campaigns to promote sustainable seafood: Kaufland is supporting traditional tonguesole fishing in Gambia.
For every kg of MSC certified fish sold during the 4 week campaign, 50 euro cents will be donated to the African fishery to help improve the situation of fishermen in Gambia who hope to be certified against the MSC standard.
And, EDEKA supermarkets – is working with MSC on a campaign that features high impact point-of-sale materials to promote MSC products.
This is the first joint-MSC in-store supermarket campaign that encourages shoppers to look for the eco-label.
I went to the University of Texas, a law school which is one of the top ten law schools in the nation
And I was in the top three percent of the class, a member of the Texas Law Review, and constitutional law was one of my favorite classes
In fact, I received an award for the top grade of the class
I only mention this to say, I have more than a passing interest, and more than a passing knowledge, of constitutional law
Now, I'm an inactive member of the State Bar of Texas, so I haven't been directly involved in legal research for many years
But I've tried to keep up with this area of the law Because it is so important to us as Christians
So I'd like to make a few comments
Religious freedom is established in the U

Hi, I'm kevin Chern.
I'm a bankruptcy attorney.
BOB KUPBENS: We use a lot of different methods to gain consumer insight, I think.
Everything from highly numerical analytics that happens within each of our channels to external panels.
And so we do panels, we do surveys, and we ask customers directly what do they like about our channels versus others, what do they see on our site versus competitors' sites, and how is that going?
We also, sometimes in a very humbling way, read customer verbatims every day.
And so people have the ability to complain about all kinds of things, or give us props for some of our latest enhancements.
And I think that's really exciting, because you feel like you're really getting the voice of the customer.
We're doing that again across social channels, we're doing that on the web.
Although nearly 24 million workers are classified as unemployed or underemployed, employers are having difficulty finding skilled employees.
A new study from Deloitte found that most applicants do not have the skills employers are looking for when they apply.
SECRETARY KERRY: I think it was a very important step.
We spent a fair amount of time -- I think we spent about 40 minutes -- talking together about the possibilities for both of our countries.
I want thank Venezuela that Mr. Tim Tracy has been released as of this morning and returned to the United States, and that is a very positive development.
I also want to thank for them for the selection and the appointment of Ambassador Ortega to come to Washington to serve as the charge d'affaires.
And we agreed today, both of us, Venezuela and the United States, that we would like to see our countries find a new way forward, establish a more constructive and positive relationship, and find the ways to do that.
DARREN HUSTON: Yeah, 2010, I mean there is so much change going on but just at the highest level.
I think, obviously, there's a ton of innovation going on in the search space, both Google and us spending a ton of energy innovating in search.
And I think that's going to be great, ultimately, for our end users.
So you're going to see a lot more coming in the search space almost every week.
And then in the space of behavioral targeting, it's getting more and more precise to a point now where we do custom targeting for specific brands, really figuring out who exactly is their consumer and then going out to find millions of people like that through the advent of just very advanced custom behavioral targeting.
And then in the brands space, some great stuff, HD video, rich media is hot.
By policy, you're not allowed to share your Dalhousie password.
That includes with your significant others, or your children, or even your boss.
Some well-meaning bosses have thought, "Well I need to keep all these passwords on file, just in case."  That's not correct.
If you need to share, let's say, a folder of email, one particular folder with your boss, there are ways of technically setting that up so you can both access it with your own NetID and password.
but now I think we can still stand proud and say that our's head and shoulders above anyone else in the world
And you'll all going to study at some of them
And it's a great shame obviously for me that none of you are going to Oxford but I'll get over that
I wish you all the best in your studies
Hello my name is Milly Rawley, and I'm going to read you my poem "Judging our existence". I wrote this is honour of Mental Health Awareness Week 2015, as mental health is a really sensitive subject for me, and I'm really passionate about changing views that people have towards those that suffer from it.
So, I hope you like it.
I fight a battle inside my head, I go to my sessions, I take my meds.
I try to hide my blue feelings from you but this, you do not believe to be true.
You call me crazy, insane and mental, but it's not my fault it's a developmental problem.
But you don't see it that way.
Instead, you make me cry and you make me pay.Those labels, they don't help how I'm feeling.
They make me feel worse, and life becomes even more unappealing.
I'm forced to stand alone as I fight this ongoing war, because my mental health is damaged, and I'm the one in four.
Just like Hitler and his Aryan race, you make me feel ashamed and you make me feel disgraced for existing.
For being something, that I did not choose to be, for having something, a label, that I want to be set free.


I felt out of place before I could turn these experiences into funny stories

Hi so you are a homeowner and you are wondering how to calculate the equity or if you have any equity in your property.
No problem, I'll be able to answer that.
Some of the different ways we’re starting to listen to our customers, you know, in the past it might have been more formal research, focus groups, things.
We can use interactive in digital means now to go out and even more informally ping our customers with questions.
They can self select, raise their hand and say, “I’d like to be a part of, you know, a community of interest or a user group.
And maybe I’m not as willing to go fly in and be in a huge, you know, two day conference for the user group, but interactively, you know, just bring me into a net meeting,” or these sorts of things.
And I think there’s many, many low cost ways now, many more than there ever were available to get that voice of customer to the organization.
And so we’re experimenting with either, you know, around how-- you know, okay, we have user groups.
James: Hi YouTube, I viewed your video and I think I understand your concerns in respect to the affect of knowledge based regulation of markets.
I don't hate you
I wish I could
But I won't leave
until I've learned exactly why they did this
Hello, my name is David Kent and I would like to say thank you for taking a few moments to learn more the Biofreeze Educational Brochure with the sample pack attached.
What is beautiful about this offering from Performance Health is that it is free for you the practitioner.
It is a great promotional tool.
Every tournament will pick a different province type, for example the "Elixier Tournament”
The more provinces of this type you have completed, the more tournament provinces will be available for you
First, you have to start with the closest province to your hometown
If you enter it, you will see a new kind of encounters
You can still fight or negotiate, but the rules for fighting have slightly changed to ensure a steady challenge for you
If you finish the whole province, you will unlock a higher difficulty level and also expand the tournament to another, more distant province
So, the difficulty rises not only with the distance of the province, but also with its level
And of course, higher difficulty means more and better rewards
We also implemented an exciting new multiplayer feature
Every province also collects its own points, whenever any player completes an encounter there
so we don't want to send five emails in one day
I have done that before it's not good
so what happens when we spam our people is that we just become white noise and they block us out or they send us to their spam folder
and number four: don't use insider language
a lot of times in the church we say things that people outside of the church don't understand and ultimately our goal is to communicate with other people who don't go to our church
in our church we tend to talk as if we're talking to church members
so, for example, in the Methodist Church we say things like: acolytes, narthex, communion
we have all of these different terms that people may not understand if they are new to the church
they may come from other traditions, faith traditions
A new report from KPMG found that medium sized businesses in North America intend to grow their presence overseas in the coming months.
IF you claim to follow Jesus as your God, then I have a question for you: Are you worthy to be counted as a witness for Jesus?
Are you worthy to be called a witness?
A witness is someone who has seen something.
NO judge and NO court would call you to testify about something you never saw, and you would have to have seen that thing first hand.
So if you’re going to be a worthy witness for Jesus, you have to have truly met Jesus.
If you have only hear about Jesus in the Bible, if you have only read about Him in books, if you have only heard about Him from other people, then that is NOT worthy of being called a witness.
A WITNESS HAS TRULY MET JESUS!

Got a lot of stupid tech bull(bleep) to show you today, so let's get into it
Everyone's been talking about virtual reality, augmented reality, and whatever hellish reality we're stuck in now
So you've probably already seen the season's biggest seller, robotic protest arms, for millennials who want to participate in democracy but don't want to look up from their phone
But, by far, the biggest tech trend this year is connecting as much stupid garbage as you can to the Internet
From smart fridges to drones, artificial intelligence has been added to everything
REPORTER: The hands-free Willow is the first smart wearable breast pump
REPORTER 2: Samsung unveiled a refrigerator you can talk to
Hi, my name is kelly hansen.
i'm the ceo of icon medical billing.
and also a former medical billing instructor.
when i first started my  company three years ago, one of the biggest decisions i had to make  is what type of software i wanted to use to run my company.
and, being that i've had some  about fifteen years of experience in the medical field, as well as  teaching medical billing, i've been exposed to quite a few softwares and  obviously one of the main ones, the ones we teach our students  on and one of the main ones in the industry is medisoft.
RENANA PERES: Indeed, word of mouth has a double role.
It has the role of enhancing and accelerating and make processes happen faster and deal in a larger scale.
But it also has this role of blocking the competition, of making your customers-- by the fact that you make customers your customers, you also in a way own their word of mouth.
Hi! I’m Smo, and today I’m guest vlogging for EF
I wanted to do this when it was still light outside, but hey, Finland in the winter time…

I love traveling and seeing new places
I haven’t done it too much though because my dad would never let me, thinking I would do something totally irresponsible and reckless, and I was like: Me? Never! However, I did visit China recently
I went to Beijing and quickly realized that you do, indeed, have to learn some of the local Chinese to get around
I would be speaking English to the taxi drivers and the hotel staff while they would reply in Chinese
So, basically, no one understood anyone
I also had to learn English when I went to the States
Who would have thought? They don’t speak Finnish there? And I’m sad to admit that I’ve never been to central Europe, which is sad, if you don’t count stopping by the airport in Amsterdam, which was already too much for me


I’m a super eager learner … when it comes to languages
I hate math and physics … and chemistry
I also have a Persian friend who teaches me a lot of bad stuff in Farsi because I totally need all the bad words
I also have a whole bunch of other friends who teach me some español, Deutsch, français … I also know a lot of random stuff in other languages
It just fascinates me immensely! If you meet me, the first thing I’ll probably ask you is about your ethnicity and the languages you speak because I am a language freak! Whenever I have the chance, I do take off to somewhere I haven’t been before
I’d hate having to leave this world having not visited every continent! Great
Several years ago I was invited by the mathematics department of a local university to speak on the topic of presentation.
The seminar was to be given on a Friday evening, and I finished preparing my content the Sunday before, so I had five days to rehearse.
Every day I made time to run through the material trying to absorb it and really make it a part of me.
On Wednesday morning something happened that taught me a lesson I’ll never forget.
It was a beautiful, sunny day and I was walking down Elmer Street on my way to an appointment.
While I walked I was using the time to run through the presentation in my head.
Naturally I didn't want passing drivers to think I was talking to myself.
In the midst of rehearsing I suddenly realized the entire middle section of my speech was redundant and needed to be cut.
This wasn’t some minor tweak.
This called for a major re-write.
Fortunately, I had the time to make the revisions and incorporate the changes into my practice.
Friday evening rolled around, I gave the seminar, and it was well received.
I often wonder what would have happened had I not allowed for that amount of time to rehearse.
Let’s just say that I had waited until Thursday night to write the presentation.
This next clip is on how to hire staff for your event.
[BACKGROUND VOICES] NANCY LUBLIN &gt;&gt; Hello, YouTube.
The hospitality and leisure sector has had one of the worst sectors in the twelve months to the end of September compared to the same period the year before.
The latest PwC analysis of corporate insolvency numbers shows in total, there were 1,464 insolvencies in the H&amp;L sector in the past twelve months compared to 1,304 in the same period the year before.
Despite this rise, H&amp;L insolvencies in Q3 2012 were down by 15% compared to Q2, and were down by 11% compared to the same quarter last year.
This is financial advisor, Patrick Munro, talking about what is the formula for an annuity.
Many people don't understand how annuities work, so let me put it simply to you.
You learn a little bit about culture, When you live in with people, Who have been living around the world.
For example my friend from Burundi: Jeen, The other day, Came up to me to say, “My name’s Jean, si vous plait!” It seems Jeen means Demon, In his local language, So you can see him steaming, When I can’t even manage, To distinguish between spiritual warfare, And a particular type of trousers.
And then I know a Canadian, a Latin American, and a German, Who is one person.
He claims ancestral roots, From all aboot the western world, And yet finds time to rest his mind in Myanmar.
He’s the first man I’ve ever met, That had a hawk attack his head, To carry him away, or so he said, If only he’d been born a bunny rabbit instead.
When was the last time you thanked the Lord, That you haven’t got long ears, And carrots aren’t adored?
Speaking of carrots, I’ve got a ginger friend.
Have you ever met Northern Irish black belt, Who was born near Cardiff but swam well?
Who’s learning Greek and Japanese, Give him fire and he’ll eat it with ease, He might wash your feet in a breeze, So when you meet him you're pleased, Because you'll leave with no cheese, And... If you wanna meet him, Give me a shout... I know the guy.
And I know a girl, She’s Thai, She brought herself over here, But then God took over her.
She was doing her Masters in my first year, But somehow found time to give me time, making life less of a blur.
So the first observation I would have is that something important is happening in markets all around the world.
We believe that the MFS, Mobile Financial Services, can really help on bank access financial services entering into the formal economy and we believe that the Telcos have real advantages to provide.
Today this is early stage, we don't have the solutions in place but we already see that it's something shaping up to be very important.
The impact of Mobile Financial Services can be measured both as social impacts and as economic impacts and it really has a macro side which is important to countries and individuals, in particular in emerging countries.
So we see economic growth, we see the creation of jobs, employment, and so forth but we also see social benefits such as the reduction of inequality, access to the formal economy, and the increased resilience and efficiency.
A bottom-up approach to getting this right is important.
My name is Julie Asti.
I'm a certified financial planner with Asti Financial Management and, today, I'm going to talk about how to create an investment portfolio.
If you're looking to create an investment portfolio, there are a few things that you should initially consider.
The stereotype is that Cconservatives understand how economic liberty works and don’t care as much for civil liberties, and that the Lliberals care about civil liberties but don’t really care much about economic freedom or know really how free market economies are supposed to work.
The truth is there’s no real distinction between civil liberties and economic liberties.
They’re one and the same, and it’s a mistake to try to separate them out and defend one at the expense of the other.
What does it mean to have freedom of choice or freedom of conscience if I don’t have the physical freedom to make a transaction that brings that choice into reality?
For example, let’s say that you have a publishing company.
You want the freedom to be able to publish what you want.
But Wwhat does it mean to say that you have the freedom to publish what you want if there’s are restrictions on what sorts of printed material can be bought and sold?
Your right to read is tied to other people’s right to publish.
You don’t have the right to seek information if the information isn’t allowed to come into existence in the first place.
By the same token, if I have the right to publish anything I want, but some of the ideas I publish are punishable by death, then I really don’t have a substantial right to publish whatever I want.
So this is an example of how economic liberty, if we think of it from the point of view of buying and selling printed matter, is connected very intimately to your individual liberty of conscience in choosing what to read, what to think, what to believe.
Here’s another example.
Now, the next type of voice-over work that you might do, is what we're going to call, industrial voice-over.
And industrial voice-over, are things like training films, educational films, corporate videos, where people are teaching something, and perhaps there are components on the film, where they have someone voice over the voice.
Maybe we're showing how to build something, and someone is demonstrating how to build it, but they're not the ones that are talking about it.
Hello, I am Julian Leutgeb and by working with "Junge Marke" I want to make the world more suitable for young people
Because that is the change that I want to create in this world and I think out of my experience, that this includes responsibilities and tasks that I am good at and I like doing
And also because I realised during the last weeks, that this challenge is truly inspiring me
During the last 8 years at Partycipation, I led teams of up to 25 young adults, which performed great at their honorary work And I am confident and I'll be happy to do so for the „Junge Marke“ as well
I don't know if I waited for this challenge or it waited for me, but it seems kind of like it was made for me
and strength to remove yourself and do the smarter, safer thing
Especially when what you really want to do is fight back

But one of the biggest reasons students don’t tell an adult is because they don’t want to be called a snitch
this is because many people don’t know the difference between snitching and reporting

Thanks for joining me
This is my third video in the Basic Accounting Principles series for Lewis &amp; Clark Community College
This conversation is, basically, about the definition of the assets of the company
I want to take a deep dive in what those assets might be
First off, first and foremost, is the purpose of any business is of course to make money, and ultimately, profit
And, we generally characterized profit, ultimately, with having a cash position
So cash is the first asset really care about
We always hear the saying, "cash is king"
So that's the one we talk about first
But, we also have times where, for example, we may not require customers to pay us right away
So, we have these things called accounts receivable
Now, accounts receivable fits into this nifty little category called cash equivalents
So, we can turn it into cash very quickly
We expect within 30 days, ninety days maybe, that those items are going to be turned into cash
So, we have accounts receivable
That's, again, the money that our customers owe us still
We also have things call pre-paid accounts
Pre-paid accounts are, basically, where we pay things in advance
So, think if you were to pay, for example, your rent
And you paid the whole year's rent in advance at the beginning of the year
Obviously, you're not using it until you get all the way through the year
And, so, each month you're using 1/12 of that balance
But,essentially, you might you might pay that item in advance, in which case you have what's called a pre-paid
There's all kinds of different pre-paids, but that's one of the more basic examples we talk about
We also have more physical type assets; like inventory
Inventory, specifically, we talk specifically about inventories themselves, we're generally talking about merchandise that we either are making or, at least, holding for the purpose selling
It is, actually, part of our core business
There are also sub-categories of inventory
For example, supply inventories and things like that almost always are general referred to as, just simply, supplies
Now, that's also things that we're going to use up in our organization
But, they're just sitting in the supply closet, or wherever it is we keep those
They're not really something that we turn around and sell but it is things that we have available to us
We also have things that are called fixed assets
Now, fixed assets are like hard physical access so like your computer, or your desks, your office furniture, the building itself, any heavy equipment that we might have
Even vehicles would fit in Fixed Asset categories
Those fixed assets, as a general rule, depreciate over time
That is, they become less and less valuable
So we have to do a thing called depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation
Accumulated depreciation, by the way, is a contra asset, which we will cover in another video
The other thing that we have is Intangibles
Intangibles, by definition, are things that we can't touch
So, they have no actual physical presence

If we have a pattent there's a certificate or something like that represent the patent
But the pattent itself the idea can't be touched
Same way for a copyright or a franchise agreement, or whatever like that
Even though there may be paper that represent the contract involved
Those ideas, those conceps, themselves are intagible
Usually, those have finite lives
For example, patents last 20 years

So, we would take that cost, or whatever it was to acquire that patent
form of a Pixar movie
And that structure lends itself beautifully to entrepreneurial activities
You say once upon a time everybody did something a certain way
Every day they led a life, there were things that didn't work very, very well
One day we came along with a way to solve their problem
Because of that, their lives improved
Because of that, something else improved
Until finally people realized that the way to solve their problems, the way to lead a better life is to buy our product
It's so unbelievably simple and it's so much at our fingertips
So I encourage, you know, watch a Pixar movie, look at this Pixar pitch and give it a try yourself
Here's another interesting way to pitch built on the evidence
It turns out that pitches that rhyme are often more effective than pitches that don't
Now this seems peculiar, but there's great research out of Lafayette College
According to Graham Pickett, head of travel, hospitality and leisure at Deloitte, social media and review sites have an increasingly powerful role in the holiday destination decision-making process with 86% of overseas and 91% of domestic travel transactions now digitally influenced.
Speaking at the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) Travel Matters Conference in London recently, he noted, "a 60% increase in last minute hotel queries year-on-year in 20112 has dramatically shortened the booking window.
and the casual worlds, if you want to play in a more relaxed environment
Our latest changes, that some of you might have already experienced is our brand new Paladin System
So, this is the overview of the changes we made in the game
We're still actively working on Tribal Wars and we want to make sure that you have new challenges to face
We might even have a new building coming up soon
We hope that you're going to enjoy the activities we've planned for the birthday
See you soon in the game
Thankfully for you guys, we're not the only ones making videos
Actually some of you guys took part in The West's video contest last month
And we thank you guys SO much for that
Our prime concern is that in dealing with the fundamental law of the land, in assuming finally to interpret it, and therefore finally to make it, the acts of the courts should be subject to  and not above the final control of the people as a whole.
I deny that the American people have surrendered to any set of men, no matter what their position or their character, the final right to determine those fundamental questions upon which free self-government ultimately depends.
The people themselves must be the ultimate makers of their own Constitution, and where their agents differ  in their interpretations of the Constitution the people themselves should be given the chance, after full and deliberate judgment, authoritatively to settle what interpretation it is that their representatives shall thereafter adopt as binding.
We do not question the general honesty of the courts.
But in applying to present-day social conditions the general prohibitions that were intended originally as safeguards to the citizen against the arbitrary power of government in the hands of caste and privilege, these prohibitions have been turned by the courts from safeguards against political and social privilege into barriers against political and social justice and advancement.
Our purpose is not to impugn the courts, but to emancipate them from a position where they stand in the way of social justice.
And to emancipate the people, in an orderly way, from the iniquity of enforced submission to a doctrine which would turn constitutional provisions which were intended  to favor social justice and advancement into prohibitions against such justice and advancement.
In the last twenty years an increasing percentage of our people have come to depend on industry for their livelihood, so that today the wage-workers in industry rank in importance side by side with the tillers of the soil.
As a people we cannot afford to let any group of citizens or any individual citizen live or labor under conditions which are injurious to the common welfare.
Industry, therefore, must submit to such public regulation as will make it a means of life and health, not of death or inefficiency.
We must protect the crushable elements at the base of our present industrial structure.
We stand for a living wage.
Wages are subnormal if they fail to provide a living for those who devote their time and energy to industrial occupations.
The monetary equivalent of a living wage varies according to local conditions, but must include enough to secure the elements of a normal standard of living, a standard high enough to make morality possible, to provide for education and recreation, to care for immature members of the family, to maintain the family during periods of sickness, and to permit a reasonable saving for old age.
A newer type of security technology that we've seen over the last few years is something called a web application firewall.
You'll hear this referred to as a WAF.
A web application firewall is looking at web conversations, and it's trying to determine based on that web conversation if the information within your packets, within that conversation, is legitimate.
You'll often see this used to make sure that when people are inputting information into a web form that that information is correct.
If you're trying to put in a serial number, or the date, or a ZIP code, this particular web application firewall technology is looking to see, is that really is zip code you're adding in there?
Is that really a serial number?
The reason that's important is that if you try to put unexpected information into one of these fields and you're able to manipulate the application, you can often find exploits that might give you direct access to the database that's contained behind it, or direct access to the web server on which this particular application is running.
So by having this additional check of that input data, you're hopefully protecting against things like database injections and things like buffer overflows.
Alright the last type of eulogy style that you might want to choose from is called a theme, and there can be any kind of theme imaginable for a person's eulogy.
Hello, this weeks lecture is given by Zack Moir and Nikki Moran.
You met Zack last week.
- [Narrator] So be sure to ask your early childhood educator about this
If you have any further questions, you could also contact ACEQA, who oversee the implementation of the National Quality Framework
It's important to consider your expectations
Educators were being asked by parents to do things that were unsafe for their child, not in their child's best interest, and possibly in contrevention of the Education and Care Services National Law, putting educators in an incredibly difficult position
- [Karen] Ultimately, our research on sleep, rest, and relaxation has shown that it's vital for children's development and ongoing wellbeing
It helps young bodies to recuperate, and is important for their lifelong brain development and wellbeing
Okay, the first thing I want to talk about with regards to delivering a eulogy, before I even talk about style and structure, is two things.
Most likely, you will know the person that you are eulogizing, and everything that comes after this clip will be tailored as if you know the person.
A company doesn't have to give you a reason for not promoting you or when they fire you.
In certain circumstances, you may be entitled to file a claim if you feel you were wrongfully terminated or did not receive a promotion because of your protected class.
I recommend you seek an attorney or advice from an employment lawyer if you feel you were discriminated against.
This letter is from Mary Louise and she writes, "Thank you for upholding Christian, family values in your family and in your business world.
You are a courageous example of faith, hope, and charity." Our Christian faith has always been the cornerstone by which we have operated our company.
There are two virtues that you will find promoted pretty much anywhere you look.
The first is conviction.
You take a stand for what you believe in against all odds.
We love to hear stories about people who confronted the oppression of tyrants, who stared down the masses, who stood their ground against all opposition and humilation and persecution, and in the end they won!
We love to hear those stories.
And yet, we are also told that we need to maintain an open mind, which is the second virtue.
But the irony is the moment you demonstrate conviction, someone will inevitably accuse you of being close-minded.
So how does that work?
How is it that both conviction and having an open mind are virtues, and yet in practice, they are at opposite ends of a spectrum?
It is one or the other.
There is a misconception about what it means to have an open or closed mind.
This is financial adviser, Patrick Munro, talking about the complex world of IRA's.

My name's Gary Marshall.
I work for the Small Business Administration.
Many people are interested in starting their business by purchasing a franchise.
I'm Mike Campbell with Doggie Styles, Beverly Hills, California.
And, I'd like to talk about selling homemade crafts.
We do have some items here in the store that are homemade.
We have some vendors, who, a woman who sits down at her kitchen tables and sews a little dress by hand, that we sell to our customers.
A lot of people are really looking for that homemade touch.
I also find a lot of our tourists traffic, a lot of our customers from Japan, in particular, really like homemade items.
They really go crazy for that.
They say, "Why would I ever say I accept something that I want to get rid of
" Well, it's our inability to accept a feeling that usually keeps it stuck in place
By saying the setup statement, it sets us up for the rest of the process, helps neutralize any judgement we have around the problem
So you say the setup statement three times
Then you tap on the rest of the acupressure points
while simply saying how you feel
It's not about the fancy language
it's about being honest with how you're feeling, bringing that up in your body, and tapping on these acupressure points
Again, sending that calming signal to the brain
letting your brain know that even with this thought, you are safe and it's Ok to relax
So let me give you an example of what one tapping round may look like
If you are stressed, around say a deadline
Have you been thinking about jumping into the world of peer to peer lending as a form of investing?

Hello everybody.
I'm John Anderson and I'm your instructor for this online Sociology 1 (or Introductory Sociology) class.
I look forward to getting to know you all over the next 8 weeks as we explore the field of Sociology with such topics as gender, sexuality, religion, deviance, race, education and much more.
I wanted to create this welcome video mainly so that you all can actually know who I am.
I know that taking online classes can sometimes make students feel as if the teacher only exists through the internet.
While all of our contact will be through Canvas, I just wanted you all to know that I am real and I will be the instructor you are working with.
So this is my official hello.
You can find out a little more about me on the page titled "Meet Your Instructor". I want to maintain very good communication with you all so please do not ever hesitate to talk to me.
I want to be as approachable as possible.
You will find my contact information and preferences in both the welcome letter and the course syllabus.
But just to reiterate, any private contact or emails from you to me should be sent via the Inbox link at the top right corner of Canvas.
For quicker responses, feel free to text my Google Voice number which bounces to my cell phone.
I can typically respond much quicker to this method, although please only expect responses during reasonable hours.
The content for this class including discussion posts, projects, informal "quizzes", and various online activities will be conducted through Canvas modules, which are basically just structured, organized pages that must be done in sequence.
This means that you cannot skip ahead to material or content that has not been viewed or completed.
I don't do this to make your life miserable -- I promise.
Alright, now let's talk about, in relation to content, adaptation of material.
Let's talk about living an integrated life.
It's a concept Bill George brings out in his book True North.
I use this tool among others when I work with the LeaderSync Group, my organization as we coach and help develop leaders, leadership teams and groups.
One of the sections in there is this idea of bringing all the components of your life together and holistic functioning way.
George says, "Don't get this confused with balance that's this is not a code word for balance, balance I believe is a myth that a misnomer." But it is about focus an integration of the key areas like relationships, work-life, personal growth as a leader, leadership challenges, skill development etc.
So George focuses on that, we do as we work with and coach leaders.
He quotes John Donahoe who is the CEO of Ebay seceded May, Meg Whitman.
Donahoe says, "The struggle is constant as the trade-offs and choices don't get any easier as you get older.
George says living an integrated life is a challenging thing to do and allows you to live a life that when the highs are high you don't get cocky and when you hit the low moments now you don't get depressed and go into despair because your integrating a number of components together so you have more of a whole life as a leader.
I focus on three areas when I do my leadership development work; story, soul and strategy.
Story is mining things like you're defining moments as a leader, you're driving values, some of the primary strenths that you have that got you where you are.
Let's mine those, let's find out where they came from, you know, how they work, how they contribute to your leadership growth so we work a bit in story.
The last zone that is still used in play is called the phased-out zone.
The phased-out zone is a special place in the game where you put creatures or other permanents that have the ability phasing.
Anything that has phasing that is in play currently is put into the POZ at the beginning of your turn.
In fact, before you untap, that's the only thing that can happen before your untapped step.
There's lots of goods and bads about being a financial adviser.
This is financial advisor Patrick Munro discussing a very important term, teaching children about the importance of personal finance.
It seems as the society evolves, the children in the society should pick up the mistakes of the elder generation before it.
In recent days, the State of Israel has achieved a global breakthrough in the ability to locate tunnels.
I congratulate the IDF Chief-of-Staff, the IDF, the ISA and the intelligence and technology personnel on this unique breakthrough.
The government is investing considerable capital in countering the tunnel threat.

Hi I am Kathleen Jaben Welcome to Textile Science.
If the word science in the title of this course made you nervous, it is a science.
but it is a science you will really be glad you got involved with.
If you chose your major because you want to be involved in the fashion or apparel industry then you have to ask yourself, "how can I be in this industry without knowing about fabric?" This is where I agree with you.
I love fabric I have always loved fabric for as long as I can remember.
Think of me as the person you see walking through a store with one arm outstretched touching and feeling all of the apparel.
I am also the person who might go into a fabric store and buy a piece of fabric and without even knowing what I plan to use it for.
I just wanted it.
Fabric is the paint and the paint brush of the industry.
Textile science is the foundation knowledge of all fabrics.
This class is challenging but it is also very engaging.
You will leave it knowing a lot more about fabric and hopefully you will love fabric.
So I am looking forward to working with you and increasing your knowledge about fabric.
The first thing I would like you to do is to introduce yourself to me and other classmates by joining the discussion forum.
What I would like you to do is find a garment, take a look at the label in the garment, I have a garment which is a white jacket that I wear often.
The label reads 98% cotton and 2 % spandex .I have given a few questions to answer.
The first question is: Is this garment comfortable to wear?
My garment for example is very comfortable particularly in California where we don't need anything very heavy to cover and keep my body temperature comfortable and the way I like it.
point in this process, in that stage there I'm going to turn the slide
KIMBERLY STEVENS, NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE: I always was very withdrawn.
I was sexually molested at about the age of 3 and I became very withdrawn.
I was molested by my uncle and my cousin.
I just really grew close to my father and my grandfather.
But, as I got older, my mother and father got divorced, my grandfather died, and my life just kind of spiraled.
I started going out and I liked boys, but I didn't like boys.
I guess the trauma... You know, I always liked being around boys, but I didn't want them to touch me.
So I started drinking and then along came the drugs.
I'll say I kind of tampered with that for quite a few years.
I started in high school with drugs, kind of frequently.
Then, after that, it became an every-day thing.
I'd say by the age of 28 I was a full-blown addict.
I resorted to selling drugs to support my habit.
So then I started going to jail, back and forth to jail.
So it was a vicious cycle.
I went to jail, sold drugs, went to jail, sold drugs.
Plus I got really emotionally invested in the characters and this is coming from someone who doesn't often read historical books, so if you, like me, don't frequently read historical, I would still recommend it because it's just a fantastic book
All right, now let's talk about focusing audience attention.
Many new entrepreneurs think life is like it looks on TV, on Shark Tank or Dragon's Den.
You go, you pitch the investor, they like what you're doing they say yes and they give you a check.
Actually, even on Shark Tank between the moment when the check is offered and the check is actually received is a process called due diligence where the investor brings in their outside experts to verify all of the information in your company.
Hi, my name is Mike Hineberg and I'm an Independent Living Skill Coordinator at IndependenceFirst where I've worked for fifteen years.
The most unique thing about my job at IndependenceFirst is that I work in an environment where over half the people are individuals with disabilities.
For me, as a person with a disability, that's a very unique feature because finally I am at a workplace where I don't have to either hide my disability or make excuses or educate my co-workers for what they should or should not do for me.
I have a strong thrive to help people with disabilities achieve maximum  independence.
I do that by teaching them independent life skills  such as how to manage a checking account, time management, money management, self esteem, service skills, bus skills, jobs seeking skills, essentially what every person needs in order to be more independent in thier life.
I do all that in the context  of empowerment, independent decision making, we do not, uh... we do not do case management.
Life skills will power the individuals to make as many decisions for themselves as they can.
Hello I?m Mark Blocker with Expert Village.
Matt: Hi YouTube, this is Matt from British council.
I've just been in the BBC debate on the financial crisis.
MR TONER: I’m pleased to announce we’re releasing the first-ever joint USAID-State Department Strategy on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism, continuing to build on the efforts launched at the February 2015 White House summit.
This strategy provides a roadmap with five strategic objectives to meet the challenge of radicalization, to violence, and as well as terrorist recruitment.
I am Professor Kheang Un.
I will be teaching POLS 362 called The Politics of Developing Areas.
As you might know, about three-quarters of the world population live in developing areas.
We found in our Sandy recovery work that it's important to engage the whole community, meaning local governments non-profit groups, schools, health care providers, those with access and functional needs, and vulnerable populations, in identifying recovery needs across sectors and disciplines.
This helps us identify community priorities, which in turn helps us identify recovery projects and federal programs that actually meet the needs of impacted communities.
Then we try to ground these priorities with good science and data to assist local communities formulate recovery plans and projects that are resilient, cost effective, and inclusive.
Hi everyone, BJ Smith from The Busy Marketer coming to you from my podcast studio with another edition of Digital Marketing News for The Busy Marketer ... #TBMnews ... The latest information on Digital Marketing that you need to know right now.
Our story today comes from Facebook.
Yesterday Facebook announced more video updates, this time taking some plays out of YouTube's book.
The first update, which will be rolling out this week, is the addition of a view count on videos.
So, down at the bottom of every video you'll see a number of likes, number of comments, and number of views.
According to Facebook, “views will be shown on public videos from people and pages, to help people discover new, popular videos.” The first thing that popped in my mind when I read this was, how is this going to affect small businesses and small organizations that don't have a large following?
Will people be less likely to view a video with a dozen views when they're used to seeing viral videos, or even videos from large organizations with thousands of views?
I was a little turned off with the statement, “to help people DISCOVER new, popular videos.” In the same press release Facebook talks about how video ranking in News Feed was improved a few months ago to show people more relevant and interesting videos.
So how exactly does showing the number of views help since they already have an algorithm in place to get appropriate videos in front of people?
And what exactly counts as a view?
When a video appears in most peoples News Feed it auto-plays.
If an auto-play counts as a view, then organizations with hundreds of thousands of followers are going to naturally show a high number of views because it's showing up in the News Feed of many of their followers.
One of the things I love about social media is, at least in the beginning, it leveled the playing field.
Small organizations could run grassroots marketing and had a chance against the large corporations.
A $100,000 businesses could be shown in the same feed with the Wal-Marts of the world.
It seems with every update to Facebook, the balance swings more and more in favor of the companies with the biggest budgets.
The cynic in me has to question whether this is a play to get more Pages to buy advertising to get their video views up.
Is it just me?
Let me know by leaving a comment below.
ROB BROSNAN: So the way that we tap into the consumer is truly different.
Good day, Eric Bakker, author of Candida Crusher with another frequently asked question.
They just keep coming on.
There are plenty of these.
Can I use an over-the-counter anti-fungal cream for my itch?
Of course you can.
There are many different creams and lotions and potions you can use for yeast infection.
My recommendations are for you not really to use the pharmaceutical approach where you're going to use a vaginal applicator and a pharmaceutical cream.
I don't find women often have success with these products.

This is a quick summary and analysis of The Road by Cormac McCarthy.
This is a story about a man and his son who are travelling along a road in the aftermath of a disaster that has destroyed most of the world.
The man is harboring a bad cough, but tries to make the best of it since he’s all his son has left.
They travel light, carrying just what they need to survive, and are extremely cautious of the few people that they do come across.
Supplies are limited since most of civilization has been destroyed.
They carry a map and are heading towards the coast, hoping for better weather.
During their journey, they encounter various individuals, including an armed group of militia, a lonely little boy, a basement full of prisoners to be eaten, and a blind old man.
Along their journey, they find supplies of food and blankets, but the man insists that they keep moving.
They eventually get to the coast and the man sees a distant boat off the shore.
He swims to the boat and discovers that it’s abandoned and contains useful supplies, like a flare gun.
After raiding the boat of all of its supplies, the man and boy continue moving on.
However, someone takes their cart and supplies, so they go after the thief.
After retrieving their supplies and cart, they enter a quiet town, but are suddenly attacked by a man with a bow and arrow.
The man is wounded by an arrow and his son can only watch as he tries to bandage his wound.
The man is dying and tells his son that he must continue travelling on the road.
I am Dr. Charles Grimes and I'm speaking on behalf of Expert Village about how to deal with the day of your theatrical audition.
UK Businesses gearing up for more mergers and acquisitions Evidence that UK businesses are gearing themselves up for more mergers and acquisitions is backed up by two surveys from the country's top accountancy firms.
Ernst and Young said 42 percent of businesses surveyed were putting capital aside for takeover activity rather than paying down debts.

is what happens when we also have vertex capacities
These correspond to the amount of processing power that each middlebox in the network may or may not have
And finally, our goal is to find a way to simultaneously route and process as much of the flow as possible
Meaning that between each SI and TI, we want to send a flow that satisfies all of the edge capacities
But at the same time, this flow can allocate one unit of processing to one of the vertices that it goes through
And we don't want to exceed any of these vertex processing constraints, either
And we're going to assume that each unit of flow really corresponds to one unit of processing
So this is really a two part problem
There is both the routing part and the steering part
So in the routing part, we're going to try getting flow from the sources to the sinks
Hello, my name is David Scher, and I am an attorney with The Employment Law Group law firm.
The purpose of today's video blog is to honor and celebrate Sherry Hunt, a former employee of Citigroup, who blew the whistle on hundreds of millions of dollars of mortgage fraud.
As a result of Sherry Hunt's brave actions, over a hundred million dollars was returned to the US treasury.
Tax payer fraud committed by Citigroup over a number of years.
What happened here is really interesting.
There really are three key facts that are important to know.
First of all, Sherry Hunt, who was an employee of Citigroup, and her specific job was to disclose and ferret out fraud, had reported that fraud to all of her employers, all of her supervisors through the chain of command of the company.
Instead of acknowledging her efforts and correcting the fraud, Citigroup kept the fraud ongoing, kept persisting and tried to bury it, and in fact, that led to Sherry Hunt's ultimate demise from the company.
The second interesting fact here is the return of over 100 million dollars to tax payers.
The fraud Citigroup committed here was involving Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government sponsored entities.
You may recall, that just recently, government and the tax payers paid over 400 million dollars to bail out Citigroup, and what did Citigroup do?
It committed fraud with those dollars; so at least, we have returned some money back to the tax payers and back to the US treasury.
The third interesting fact here is that Sherry Hunt was paid 31 million dollars for her efforts.
And that may seem like, well it is a lot of money, but that may seem maybe like it seems like it's too much to you.
entire week and I don't have to think about it again
So, for me, I schedule a reminder about rehearsal on Sunday afternoons
On Monday morning I've scheduled a prayer that goes out to them right before they get to school and this reminds them that I'm praying for them
On Wednesdays I tweet out the hashtag #wordsfromrehearsal and I use just a little snippet of music, a little snippet of text from the rehearsal that they just had
The hope is that they'll connect the words that we've practiced on Sunday with their life on Wednesday and beyond
One of the other great features about this app is the ability to communicate with a student one-on-one in a safe way
So the way that remind allows me to do that is, through the app I can have a conversation one-on-one with the student, but it's all saved online so there's no liability issues
Another great thing about remind is to be able to have group conversations
Hi, Gina Schreck here with a conference tip for you.
I am in the beautiful Kingdom of Bahrain attending and speaking at the conference for PMI-AGC.
And you could see it�s just gorgeous here at the Gulf Hotel.
But reminding me of a great social marketing tip for you, number one, when you collect all the business cards from folks at a conference, be sure to go back that night right away and connect with those people on LinkedIn instead of just putting a rubber band around those business cards and stuffing them in your drawer.
Good morning, Hank, it's Fri- Blue guys, what are you doing lyin' around on the job?
Show some respect for my audience.
That's better.
So Hank, I've been sick lately - in fact, I have a note from my doctor saying I don't have to do my punishment - but I wanted to continue our conversation about religion.
But I also know that some people find that kinda boring, so here's some dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dance, dance, dance, dance!
Right, so Hank, in your video on Wednesday, you pointed out how difficult it can be to answer yes or no questions like "Do you believe in God?" because you have to define terms like "believe" and "God." Also, "in." And that made me think about how difficult it is to define any religious identity.
Like, for instance, Muslims - Muslims believe in the Five Pillars of Islam, right?
You have the shahada, the belief that there is no God but God; prayer, at least five times a day.
Being a teacher means being a member of of one of the most honorable and rewarding professions As one of our colleagues put it so very well: "When the untapped potential of a child meets the creative imagination of the teacher a miracle occurs

And let me tell you that most of the 60 million teachers on this planet experiences that Miracle frequently
It is the source, if you will, of our passion
Yet the current debate on what teaching is about has been narrowed to neat measurable outcomes that are generally limited to what's testable via a series of multiple choice items


And teachers are held accountable for results
Time spend doing anything but that is considered off topic an off track
Many colleagues would join teaching to make a difference in kids' lives and to build learning communities are leaving the profession in droves because in too many places it is being reverted to a service delivery industry based on control, on sanctions and on compliance
we hear it all the time


So important, we are told, that special attention must be given to recruiting the best and the brightest into the schools that need them most
Again, we absolutely agree
But there's a big gap between our political leaders say and the harsh reality of teachers' autonomy and professional freedoms being restricted, and their rights being widely ignored
&gt;&gt; Felicia Boyle: At this point, there are things that I am a little nervous about.
I am still trying to learn APA formatting.
My previous universities all used MLA and so that is one thing that I know that writing has been a little bit of an issue with the APA formatting and trying to learn that.
The APA was great, getting to learn all about APA and going over some of the things in the book.
&gt;&gt; DAVID: I�ve always had this entrepreneurial bug.
So I love reading autobiographies of other entrepreneurs.
Everything from Rockefeller, to Michael Dell, Bill Gates, just the whole nine yards.
So in eighth grade a friend of mine gave me a book called �Teach Yourself C in 21 days.� I read this book, I was in my math class and I said why not just write some software to solve my math problems� make sure that I got the answers correct.
That�s really what got me hooked on using software to solve different problems.
So it progressed into building websites with the dotcom boom, so I built websites for different organizations at the Duke campus.
How are you doing, you're watching Expert Village, my name is Scot Ruggles and I am here to take you through what it takes to be a football coach.
Once I got done playing college football, I got right into coaching, I, uh, sort of grew up around the game, my father is a long time high school and college football coach.
My first coaching job I started at Wagner College.
This is the Revision Vitam C Lotion.
The Revision Vitamin C Lotion 30% is a lightweight, water-based, oil-free lotion that assists in firming and brightening the skin.
&gt;&gt; Sure, there's no doubt about it.
to a few religions, not to all of them, therefore it shouldn’t be part of state education
To prove this, Bobby Henderson argued that he believed a supernatural Italian dinner was the world creator and that whenever a scientist tried to carbon date an object, to see how old it was, this god was there “changing the results with his noodly appendage”
He said his beliefs were just as valid as Creationists, therefore should be included in the curriculum as well
The idea took hold and spread around the internet and the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster has many followers, allegedly leading back to pirates, who were the original Pastafarians
This is Lily Iatridis of Fortuigence with another summer writing activity for you to do with your kids or for your kids to do on their own, depending on their age level and independence with writing.
Now, this idea was submitted by Susan Williams of Education Possible.
I want to make sure she gets credit for this.
Here is her idea.
How about having your kids write an online review of a product that they often use or know a lot about?
I think that would be a fabulous idea, especially on Amazon or whatever other sites you frequently shop at online.
Usually when we write a product review, for example, in our Textual Analysis Essay short course or as part of the Essay Rockstar Approach semester-long program, the first thing you have to do is to discuss and identify the purpose the author or the creator of whatever it is they're reviewing intended, but with online reviews you kind of don't need to do that.
You could skip that step all together.
The product description online will already give the purpose of the product, what it's supposed to do, what its creator intended it to do and so on, so all your kids have to do is to sit down and think and write a review of the product that will be useful to other readers.
The one example that comes to mind happened during my first job out of college when I failed to meet the deadline on a draft of an article that I was working on.
And it was a matter of not managing my time effectively, I was working on another simultaneous project that I prioritized and I have to say I really took that experience to heart and I've been much more deliberate since then in how I manage my time.
So even though I'm not glad that it happened I'm grateful for the learning experience
Hey guys, little channel update here and you might be wondering why is the video so shaky!
that's caue I'm recording with my tablet and why am I doing that of all things when I clearly have the technology to do better?
Well I was doing some stuff with YouTube like tutorials for better videos (creator academy) and they gave me a challenge yes they challenged me I mean it's like, not they personally but you know, you know what I mean they challenged me to make my next video with my phone or my case my tablet and record the audio with your phone (tablet) so yeah.
but anyway the channel update we have today is my new upload schedule you might have noticed that I've had an upload everyday for like a solid week now and no, I'm not going to keep that up I thought I could but it's quality over quantity right?
So I'm gonna go to a two video a week upload schedule preferably Wednesday and friday although if I can't do it on a certain day's (what) I'll dish it out another day but I'll try to stick to that and that's about all, but in case you haven't heard, have a new editor if you still haven't heard go watch some of my most recent videos, I mean heck I made a pretty big deal out of it, made like 3 or 4 videos about, that were just of my editor playing games kind of ironic if you think about it, yeah, but anyway guys thank you for watching or not watching, but if you didn't watch it, how are you gonna get this message?
Hi everyone!
BJ Smith from The Busy Marketer coming to you from inside my podcast studio, Studio B, with another edition of Digital Marketing News for The Busy Marketer.
Hashtag TBMnews - The latest information on Digital Marketing that you need to know right now.
I have to tell, I'm very excited about all the news around social media marketing that has come out this summer.
Today I have 2 stories for you.
The other one is from Facebook, so if you haven't seen that video yet, go check out The Busy Marketer YouTube channel and you will find it right next to this video ... About Twitter tailored audiences.
Yesterday, Twitter launched new tools to make it easier to create, manage and activate your tailored audiences.
Let's back up just a sec and talk about tailored audiences.
Tailored audiences on Twitter, to over simplify it, is Twitter's method of remarketing.
You have a script that places a cookie on your website visitors' browsers or some other method of identification and Twitter matches that information to the user in their system.
You can then target those users with a Twitter ad.
I've used myself as an example before: I have a one-on-one marketing coaching program that has a dedicated page on TheBusyMarketer.com.
Visitors to that page get a special cookie.
I know that some people have shown interest in that particular service, but haven't yet scheduled an appointment.
Now I can show them an ad on Twitter reminding them of the service and encouraging them to signup for it.
Now Twitter is stepping up their game with some new goodies to go along with their tailored audiences.
The first is the ability to upload your own audience.
Similar to Facebook, you can export the email addresses off of your email list and upload them for Twitter to match up with their users.
You can do the same thing with Twitter usernames and user IDs if you collect those or with mobile advertising IDs if you have your own app.
You can also upload phone numbers to create a tailored audience.
RAGHURAM IYENGAR: When you're bound into a contract, there is some uncertainty that you have.
Think about the cell phone providers today in the US.
One of the big things that is going on there is that the contract plans are so complicated that you as a consumer, when you're signing up, you have absolutely no idea what final monthly fee are you going to end up with.
If somehow you end up consuming less than the number of free minutes, you're fine.
If you end up consuming more, you're not exactly sure how are you going to be charged.
A lot of it is fine print.
And about 50% or so of the revenue comes from this overage and underage.
Hello This is the first time I have ever used a flat fee MLS Realtor service I've bought homes for sale by owner I've sold homes by owner I've used Realtors on both sides and as I said this is really my first experience and I couldn't be more pleased.
I really like the the menu service where you can go into a list of options and pick what you want.
I got the the scheduling service which worked out really worked out really well for me.
Kind of screened people ahead of time I was extremely pleased with that and probably the best feature was the upgrade for a virtual tour and they came out and did a beautiful job-the home showed really well and i got lots and lots of response  ended up selling the home through a realtor and only paid two point seven percent commission.
The staff was great all the time helped me with everything I needed.
&gt;&gt; So I'm Will Swope.
I run sustainability for Intel.
And the question I want to address is dealing with the economy verse dealing with the environment.
And my simple message in return is, we should never let this crisis go to waste.
As in a personal level here are things we can do.
We can do two less, two less degrees of heat, two less degrees of cooling.
This is financial adviser Patrick Munro talking about what is a 40l k plan.
Once an individual becomes an employee and they are working with a progressive company and they pass their probationary period, usually an employer will encourage them to participate in a retirement plan at work.
PATRICK KRAUS: For us at Pampers, it's critical.
Some of the things that we discussed today with BabyCenter and some of the Google work that's done shows how important or how much mom relies on Search.
When a mom becomes pregnant, the first place she goes is her husband, probably, or her partner, to say "I'm pregnant." And then the next place is probably Google to type in pregnancy or pregnancy symptoms.
And that's where you've got to connect.
There are several ways that you can recognize that you are starting to develop a hearing loss.
With hearing loss it does happen in most cases very gradually, so it tends to sneak up on some people, but there are some tell tale signs.
Beyond this, the job actually has few official duties and as a result, every Secretary General has interpreted it differently
For instance some act as “world moderators”, which is to say, the diplomatic mediator in international disputes
In fact when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was creating the UN, this is how he envisioned the Secretary General’s role
One example of a “moderator”-type was Secretary General Kofi Annan, who prioritized human rights and the spread of HIV while in office from 1997 to 2006
By comparison, Annan’s successor, Ban Ki Moon, has been more of an administrator-type, overseeing the UN but with little input about what its moral obligations should be
Not only is the job of the Secretary General open to interpretation, but so is the appointment process
A new survey released yesterday by KPMG International, titled Navigating APAs, shows that respondents believe the benefits of an APA outweigh the costs.
To explore the current perceptions and experiences with APA programs globally, in-depth interviews were conducted with tax directors (or their equivalents) from 25 multinational companies in seven countries.
Hi this Shana Bethune on behalf of Expert Village and I'm going to talk to you about image manipulation in final cut pro.
So let's say you are in the process of editing and you find a spot that you really like but you wish the camera have zoomed in just a little bit or maybe it is rotated to the right a little too far and you want to fix it.
Well here is how you do that.
So let's say you want this shot to be a little bit tighter than what it is here and make sure it is in the viewer and then I change my view of the clips so it is about fifty percent and over here I select image and wire frame.
So I can see the image and this frame around it to let me know how big it is.
Now I grab on to the corners here and pull it out to make it bigger and once I have it at the size that I want I can move it around like this.
To select the part of the shot that I want to have in the frame.
DAVID KIDDER: The first one is attribution, is identifying opportunities to spend money down various channels, and connect those spending patterns and the data comes out of them, to optimize them towards a goal.
I'm Jeanna Rock, and we're discussing how to lead a book discussion.
First of all, make sure that you read the book.
And encourage the other members of your group to read it as well.
The only way you're going to move Washington, D.C.
is at the chief executive level.
The entrenched interests of Congress, and this is an indictment of both the democrats and republicans, are such that you raise money from the special interests, you give them their special little flavors and you get re-elected again and again and again.
Henderson: So as president what would you do to change that?
Schweitzer: Well, to start with, if you look at my record in Montana, I was elected without taking a penny of special interest money.
I didn't take any PAC money when I was elected or re-elected.
I didn't demand at the other side, I didn't even challenge them not to.
Hello and Welcome My name is Robert Reierson  - President &amp; CEO of Tradex Foods.
Thank you for joining us for the fifth edition of The Tradex Foods "3-Minute Market Insight" The Monday morning “pulse report” for seafood purchasers.
In news this week American consumers are showing signs of optimism.
It was just a year ago when middle class Americans tightened control on discretionary spending by 3.5 percent the largest single-year drop since record keeping began in 1984. But for 2010 the Consumer Confidence Index is much more optimistic consumers may still be weighed down by employment concerns but they are definitely more positive than in previous years and the impact on sales has been noticeable.
Casual dining restaurants reported strong sales over the summer which then carried into This upswing should fuel margin and earnings growth for many companies.
Improved sales at the restaurant level will funnel up the supply chain to distributors who should be targeting chains that show high foot-traffic trends AND those with pricing power those being chains that have the ability to raise prices without seeing much effect on demand.
In the retail sector there is also evidence of a slowly rebounding economy while 2009 was a period of discounts and low prices this year and in 2011 consumers are ready to pay a bit more BUT they want value for their money.
Brands can't force their way into the conversation.
Lots of brands would like to.
And that's a major mistake.
Because the consumer doesn't want them there.
Unless they choose to have them there.
What Crispin Porter does, and I love this way of thinking, is they create advertising that will become part of the conversation.
According to the KPMG survey, Economic Capital Modeling in the Insurance Industry, EC modeling is a way of calculating how much capital a business needs to meet its future risk.
It has the potential to transform the way organizations control risks and manage their businesses right across the global insurance industry.
However, a survey of the world's top insurers shows that a lack of understanding at the very top could hinder its effectiveness.
DAVID BELL: I've seen retailers that are very, very specialized, like Dave's Cookies, Sophie's Wine, diapers.com, bonobos.com.
Companies with pretty narrow product lines, almost a single-product category, essentially be able to survive, even thrive on the internet, because they can aggregate demand out of the space.
Whereas if I open a very, very focused retailer in one location, my demand typically is somewhat limited.
Hi, my name is Michael Orkin and I am a television producer.
This is when I became a victim of bullying
You would think people are bullied for their looks or their sexual orientation
However, I was bullied because of a small, tiny piece of cotton, also known as a tampon
A kid in my grade got into my spacemaker case looking for a pencil, and he found this tampon inside
Pretty soon, I was walking down the halls, I was being whispered about and called names
One that distinctly stands out to me that I remember being called, was a slut

Hi, I'm Audrey Wagstaffe, and I'll be doing a monologue from Enigma by Floyd Dell.
No, it happened to me, it didn't happen to you.
You walked in, with the air of a god on a holiday.
It was I who fell, headlong, dizzy, blind... I didn't want to love you!
It was a force too strong for me.
I am only 26 years old.
But for 25 years of my life I was in organized church.
In 2004 I became a professional pastor.
I was paid to be a pastor.
I brought many people to church.
I discipled many people.
It wasn’t until about a year ago that the Lord started to speak to me, and at one point He said to me; “ANDY who have YOU made a disciple, who is following ME because of your ministry?” I said; “Lord YOU know.
Tell me who I have made disciples, You know who they are by name.” You know He didn’t tell me.
In this course you'll be asked to write four short Journal reflections these little Journal reflections are different than most journals in the sense that they follow the focused conversation model and so when you submit these four journals they have to be divided using headers of objective, reflective, interpretive and decisional So that's how your going to.
It's two pages you're probably write a half a page on each one out those four.
There's no maximum length so if you really get into the topic and you want to really do a deeper dive.
I've had journals come in that are eight or nine pages not recommending that but if you want to do that - you can do do that.
This assignment is at 10 percent and we would like you to upload those journals one at a time, individually into the Moodle course and so this allows you to you know maybe you've got an evening.
These journals are based on quotes you find a quote there that really kinda speaks to you and so you can just tear right into that and write up one of those four journals in an evening during commercial breaks and then upload it into the Moodle course.
&gt;&gt; Dr. Kuzon: So about relationships with patients, I think all physicians have different styles.
One of the nice things about plastic surgery that I enjoy is we see our patients on a repeated basis over long periods of time.
We don't operate on them once and then their treatment is completed and we don't see them anymore.
We are often doing reconstructions that take multiple stages.
Or there's lots of reasons we see them over long periods of time.
So against that backdrop, my personal nostalgia position I think is -- honestly it's quite business like.
I think that provides them with the best level of decision making regarding their care.
Plastic surgery is a poorly understood specialty by the general public.
I’ve long believed that relationships go bad with misaligned expectations.
I’ve known Peter Winick for several years, more recently I’ve met Bill, Jessica and other members of the team.
And I think the best way I can describe my work with them is that Peter quickly gets to know you and understands what makes you tick, what your priorities are.
Understands that in my case this idea, these concepts have been my baby for a number of years and it’s very hard to go from a sole practitioner and steward of birthing this idea and raising it and growing it and really working hard to build a brand and deliver value to customers to now letting go.
You've recently purchased some corporate stock and you're becoming involved in following the progress and the operations of the corporation in which you've invested and you're hearing terminology that you vaguely remember maybe you heard about it in your 8th grade civics class or you read about it in the newspaper, but you're not that comfortable with the terminology and one of the phrases is corporate loyalty, duty of corporate loyalty.
INTRODUCTION The Introduction section of your paper is pretty much exactly what it sounds likeóyou'll introduce your topic and give any background information that whoever is reading your paper will need to understand.
You can use the introduction to summarize your whole projectóexcept the results.
&gt;&gt;Brad Anderson: I think most of the time we have spent here at Davos has been on the environment.
What’s clearly fueling the change in B to B marketing and marketing per se is technology.
The ability to track and monitor and quickly execute digitally on what your audience and your prospects are doing, right?
And it’s-- one thing that I haven’t seen yet in many marketing environments, is organizations that are set up to listen really well.
Dr. Grigg's first lecture reminded us that, thanks to shared water resources, we're often interconnected, even though we may not recognize it.
The water conflicts he touched on reflected tensions between different types of users, upstream versus downstream neighbors, users in adjacent basins connected by inter-basin transfers, users in adjacent states and in adjacent nations.
He showed us how solutions to these conflicts are often elusive.
Not so much for lack of technology or money, but for the lack of effective governance.

As Marginson points out: An important practical question, then, is: is it possible for institutions that we think are very well established, highly unlikely to change, actually to be quite fragile and unstable, is it possible that they will dissolve from one day to the next
One could argue that the global financial crisis in 2008 was an example of the world coming very close to that
SAMEER SAMAT: In the world of retail, which is primarily where I focus, I think that there's a few big changes that are coming for advertisers that they really need to get ready for.
The first I think-- and the primary one that I point to-- is the connection between the online world and the offline world.
Historically many advertisers have thought of these as two different channels.
And in fact, consumers I think less and less are thinking of them in that kind of distinct way.
In this clip we're going to talk about how to pick a location for your convention.
Hi, this is Karen Schimpf with Commercial Capital.
Today I am going to discuss what underwriters are looking for when underwriting a business commercial financing loan.
Now, many people believe that getting a loan for commercial property depends solely on the strength of the commercial property.
Well, this assumption would not be correct.
Lenders look at the strength of the borrower.
Many of the Commercial lenders determine the strength a borrower by reviewing your personal net worth.
Some Commercial Property Lenders use this information to determine the loan amount they will lend  and some will use this information determine if they are going to lend to you at all.
Numerous Commercial lenders look at your personal net worth because they will only lend you the requested amount that is either equal to or greater than you Personal Net  Net Worth.
Many lenders want to know your personal net worth  to find out if you are real estate heavy.
Some lenders do not want to lend to borrowers that do not too much real estate and not enough liquid assets.
So to determine your net worth, the underwriter will review  your balance sheet.

DAVID KIDDER: One of the most powerful things that marketers can do in learning about the reputation and their relationship with customers is to use both social and online channels to engage in conversation, but also to monitor it.
There are many different kind of consumer conversational places in the marketplace, like related to customer service, product reviews in those places, that a brand can very nearly instantaneously understand the context and the intent of a customer relationship's with a brand and a product.
And so to not participate in those places, to not engage, not to listen, is a huge strategic mistake.
But in the other side, it's clearly an opportunity.
A product road map can be built by simply listening to the marketplace.
Companies that were built looking forward in the marketplace had had success in the past.
Now companies need to be built backwards.
They need to listen to the conversation in the marketplace, build what the demand is, and look at the data.
Those two answers, those two bright, shining lines, are your strategy.
All right, what you have to do - and you have two choices here - I recommend either one.
Hi there, I'm Tracy Goodwin, and I'm the red sweater lady.
Earlier today we spoke to the Waikato Hauraki MP Nanaia Mahuta about the latest in politics.
Firstly, I asked her what is the benefit of the Maori Select Committee heading across the Tasman to take a look at well-being initiatives for Aboriginal children?
I think it's a good idea that the Maori Select Committee have gone to Australia to look at what they're doing over there to help support their indigenous people.
And in the end, we could also be an example for them.
The health and well-being of Maori children is already in dire straits, so why go there?
It's good to go overseas to listen and take a look at what other governments are doing to help their indigenous people.
That's why they've gone to Australia.
I don't know if they'll come back with anything to benefit our own kids, but in my opinion, it's a good idea to check it out.
Oh, I had this group of like five people and, well one of them was a kid.
And I gave them like everything they wanted like the kid was going all over the place, and I had all these outrageous requests and I did it all like I was really nice to them, and then when they left, they like left me no tip and I don't get it so that was probably the worst
You've got a cold or you feel a cold coming on, there's a few things you can do to help you get rid of that cold.
Hi, Mike Johnson at vexxt.com.
Today I want to talk about your first impressions with a customer.
A lot of times we get into a store and immediately our experience it's just so bad that it really kind of dampens our intentions to browse or look for anything.
Hello my name's Kate Finley I'm the CEO of Belle Communications.
And I want to talk to you to you a little bit about what you can expect when you work with our agency.
First you can expect results, out of the first 30 days of working together we secured media coverage opportunities.
That means you're going to be talking to key media members, interviewing for features, TV, segments, national news, whatever caters to your target audience, we promise that you will get coverage within the first 30 days.
Now the reason we promise this is because we realized that that's what we've done for all of our clients to-date.
So really out of the gate you can expect results from our team.
You can expect continuous innovation, meaning we look at your brand and we really provide strategy and ideas.
Whether its looking at what the competition is doing and getting idea there or whats happening on the competitive department within your industry, what trends are happening, in social media, and content, and public relations we can really take advantage of your your brand.
We consistently bring idea to the table and we are really that strategic partner, that's kind of the added quality with working with us we want to talk through an idea, maybe it's something were not helping you on but you just want our opinion you can pick up the phone or shoot us an email or a text and really get our weigh in.
So that innovation is something we bring consistently.
The other thing that I think is under, really under valued is priority.
We treat your brand as if its our own.
We care about your end-of-year goals, your sales goals, we look into your target audiences and its not ever a situation where you don't hear from us for weeks.
We have weekly updates that we share with you a lot of daily check-ins it doesnt even go I would say maybe a few days before we talk to any and all of our clients so we treat your brand like a priority, you hear from us on a consistent and predictable basis.
The other thing we promise is promise fulfillment.
If we commit to goals with you, you're going to hear regular status updates on those goals.
Weekly, monthly, quarterly we will adjust sales as we go.
It's not going to ever be a situation where you're wondering 'what are we doing?' 'Did we do what we said?' 'Where are we on that project?' You'll have consistent updates.
And finally, transparency.
As we partner together and really treat your brand like our own brand and have you as a partner in our client family a lot of times things will change wether its within your company, within the competitive environment looking at tactics like social media and looking at Facebook and perhaps Facebook changes its terms and the way that you could function with it.
Were going to be transparent and let you know 'Hey this is a goal but this has changed in the environment we need to adjust sales, go around and find a different way to really meet that goal for you and we communicate transparency throughout the process of working together.
So that's a little insight into what its like to work with our agency feel free to check out our 'Why Belle' page and then contact us, lets start a conversation and see if were a good fit to work together.

Hey all, it's Jesiah.
I just wanted to take a minute and make a quick video about the Ryland video that's going around.
And really I don't like to use the child's name, it's really directed at his parents this video.
So I had a few thoughts, I'm going to post a link to the video down below, so you can check it out if you haven't seen it already.
So I'd just like to start out by saying it's awesome that these parents are so supportive most parents wouldn't be and people take for granted when they do have supportive parents, like I do sometimes.
But it does make life so much easier, so I just want to reiterate that that it's great they are so supportive.
Hi there I'm Lucy and I just want to make this video talking about Credit Sesame because it's a great way to get a free credit report.
So everyone knows how important it is to get your credit report.
It can prevent a lot of disasters from happening and it's just very important to know but most sites will charge you for it.

Ok, we've established what the point of the speech is, the happiness that we're going to convey.
But, as far as structure goes, the first thing you're going to do in this speech is tell everybody who you are.
Well, the biggest difference between traditional media, television and new media is that traditional media is very invasive, which viewers might not like, but advertisers like very well.
We know that people don’t want to watch political ads, so we put it in front of them repeatedly and eventually it burns through.
It’s a lot easier on line to ignore ads.
You can just click ‘em away, not pay attention.
So, well, that’s great for consumers, it’s harder for us to get our message across.
Now the plus about new media, is it is much more targeted.
You can finally target your websites and your demographics depending on where you’re placing your ads.
And also you can-- it’s much more granular and you can do much smaller buys.
With television, you know, you either go big or you go home.
It doesn’t make sense just to buy-- spend a few thousand dollars to buy a few ads.
and I’m gonna use a red circle for her big button

The blend consists of Assam and Keemun Assam, a nice strong rich malty tea from Northeast India
Keemun, a black tea from China which has floral and hints of smokiness, floral character and hints of smokiness
The two together are really great
It's got enough strength that it's refreshing and you can add milk to it as most people like to in this country
And the China in the blend just gives it that little extra something which makes it very, very, relaxing and cleansing after a meal
While TV continues to be very important, we do see that as Latinas and Latinos are working outside the home, we really need to reach them throughout the day using several different touch points.
Latinos love the digital space and even more so the mobile space.
They’re interacting with mobile at an even higher degree than non-Hispanics when it comes to downloading cell phone ring tones, for example.

there would be consequences in the rest of the world, not just in the United States
For example, the dollar has always enjoyed what Giscard d'Estaing, the former French president many years ago, called the exorbitant privilege of the dollar, because it was the currency the reserve currency that most central banks had
Well, clearly, there was a dent in this exorbitant privilege and the confidence that most people have towards the dollar

What would happen to the balloon
For example, if a spaceship just landed on the Moon and it had air in it, would it still behave the same
Now this is a very experienced science teacher, and he has seen thousands of physics problems before
But seeing this balloon embodied on the stage made him revise his understanding, made him revisit the laws of physics and think about what would happen
But what was more amazing is that when we talked about what would happen to the helium balloon, we actually used this balloon that never existed, this imaginary balloon

But it's not a crazy amount of money where girls would feel pressured into doing it if they, kind of, didn't really want to
So, you know, they're doing it, because they want to do it
Because they want to get that little bit of extra money or for whatever reason
Well, I can't think of any other reason apart from getting the money
But , yeah, it's not like that they don't want to do it or they're being forced into it or anything like that
However, the second point that I want to make is that I do think that advertising, in general, has gone too far
I read somewhere, I can't remember where but I read somewhere that the avarage person is exposed to about five thousand advertisements a day
I mean, that is a crazy amount of advertisements
Now the next type of speech, that method of delivery, is manuscript speaking, and what manuscript speaking is is, well, you're going to write it the same way that you would write any speech.
You're going to have an outline but you are going to write out or type out word for word the exact speech, exactly as it is going to be spoken, alright?
Then you are going to read it right off the paper, so it might be almost like reading a story because your speech is going to be word-for-word what is on the paper.
http://www.lewzeidnercfo.com Hello, I'm Lew Zeidner with B2B CFO®. Everyone in a company knows about the official organization chart, you know, who does what and so forth.
But did you know that businesses also have an unofficial organization chart?
It's true and identifying what it is can help your company avoid the financial risks associated with growth.
Here's what I mean, every company's unofficial org chart is comprised of just three types of employees; Finders, Minders and Grinders.

One of the best things I've heard recently was from a guy named Tony Robbins, motivational speaker.
I was on a plane with him and I was telling him how frustrating it is in our industry because people are so afraid to change, and it takes forever, and we get caught up in our underpants because we keep asking all these questions are really irrelevant because we're afraid to ask the big question.
Because we don't really want to know the answer.
Because that might scare us.

Well, the definition has got to have some clinical utility, obviously.
And the other thing is we've all accepted the fact that a medical definition has got to be quantitative in some way.
In other words, if you just have subjective signs,  it's very difficult to get a handle on them.
I mean, one of the most common things that a neurologist sees in their office are headache and dizziness.
Well, that's what we see with people with traumatic brain injury, but you see that in migraine, you see that in a lot of other neurological conditions.
How specific is that to traumatic brain injury?
These are the kinds of things we have to sort through and see not only what the prevalence--is it a higher prevalence after a head injury?
And how do those signs, symptoms, neurological or cognitive impairments relate to each other?
If somebody has a headache after a presumed head injury, are they more likely to have a cognitive deficit?
The way to do it is to use every muscle on your body including your voice

Hey we are talking about types of persuasion and we've kind of laid it out on the table here.
The reason I called Kathi, number one, is because she has such an ease of approach that I could tell from her website that fit what I currently needed, because the big revelation to me has been not getting organized, not having a daily schedule because I'm not a scheduled person
But I saw Kathi would come in and actually help me not only come up with systems and a management of those systems, but actually help me purge the things that I need to do
And as a creative, free flowing person, I don't like schedules
I don't like to be told when to do things and what to do when those time frames come
But what she's showing me and the big revelation for me is, by being organized and by learning a system and managing a system, I'm actually finally getting to do the things and begin the journey of doing what I've wanted to do for so long
And it has been through Kathi getting me organized with time management and a professional filing system

Patients who are African-American or Afro-Caribbean often ask can transplants work for them and if so are there differences between hair for them and Caucasian hair.
The answer to both is yes.
Hair transplants are extremely effective for patients with black skin.
I've done many, many, many transplants on these patients, and we get extremely good results, but it's important to know two particular factors with African-American skin.
For example, the hair is curved.
It's like a C shape.
So it's important when you're cutting the graft that you're very careful at how you do that.
Also, when you're transplanting them and putting them in, you have to keep in mind that they can curl a little bit easier.
So while one of the benefits is you get more coverage with less number of grafts, you've got to be more particular and more skilled at how you cut the grafts.
This also implies that it's difficult to do this procedure on African-American patients with the FUE, where you're cutting them out one at a time, because it's often difficult to see that C-shaped curve.

Hi, this is Jim Goettler on behalf of Expert Village and this is a video series on managing a political campaign.
In this segment, I'm going to touch on developing a staff, hiring a staff, bringing folk in to help a campaign happen.
Now obviously, I'm not going to be able to cover everything there is in these segments, as far as running a campaign.
I'm hoping to bring enough to you to give you the confidence to in turn ask more questions and involve yourself in the process.
I've told many people over the years that a campaign is not a job.
Hi, this is Andrew Krauksts here with Australian Expat Loans, and today I just want to give you a very quick tip and share with you some ideas on a very common question that I get about foreign currency loans for Aussie Expats and Foreign Investors.
I’m going to use an example of if you were to buy a property for say around $715,000, you would probably need for a foreign currency loan at least a 30% deposit.
That’s the minimum.
For this example we’re using a 30% deposit, and then you’d probably be looking at around a $500,000 Australian home loan.
I just want to go through and share with you some of the mechanics of a foreign currency loan, which a lot of people don’t really understand, especially the pro’s, but also the con’s.
I think most people are aware of the pro’s of getting a cheap interest rate.
If you were to draw down a $500,000 home loan  – and when I say $500,000, I mean in Aussie dollars, because the purchase price of the property is going to be in Australian dollars, for this example $715,000 – the lender will convert to the foreign currency that you wish.
So that $500,000 will be drawn down and then converted.
Now, obviously the pro’s about it is that you’re going to get a very cheap rate compared to the Australian home loan interest rate at a fraction of the cost.
That’s obviously one of the reasons why we get asked a lot of questions about foreign currency loans for Australian Expats and Foreign Investors.
The one thing that people don’t realize is the dangers involved with a foreign currency loan.
This period of test stimulation shows the patient exactly, and I mean exactly, what a permanent stimulator feels like so for those days it's going to be pretty simple for them to say, "Hey, this is great.
You know?
I do like it.
It's just what he said." Or, you know, "No, it's not." But it is conclusive, if the temporary one works, and by the way, it works in about 80% of the time.
Most patients that we've tried it does work.
In this lesson we're going to cover a lot of ground.
We'll talk about choosing the right UI patterns, laying out your screens, working with graphics and texts, and a whole lot more.
But before we get into all those really fun things, we'll first need to learn about one of the core aspects of Android design.
That your designs must work on a lot of often very different devices.
Android runs on all types of things from tiny watches to phones and tablets, even to cars and TV's.
This variety can be daunting.
The good news is that Android has been designed to handle this variety in device types from day one.
The platform gives you a whole bunch of tools and techniques for handling different devices easily and gracefully.
Your goal should be to create a single app that runs across a range of devices adapting the interface depending on what device it's currently running on.
As we'll find out throughout the course, optimizing the user experience across a variety of device screens and form factors isn't that difficult, and can actually be pretty fun.
Let's start by talking about the screens on all of these different devices.
Hi, I’m Stevie Aquilina and I’m studying Applied Economics.
I chose to study at Kingston because I was looking at different universities, but when I came to Kingston it was just a feeling I had about being at the university itself but also walking around town with everything that Kingston offers.
It was a whole package deal and I felt comfortable and relaxed and happier here than I did when visiting other universities.
I’m currently studying Applied Economics and the best aspect of this course, for me, is that Applied Economics applies economics to real life and real modules.
So you are doing a degree that you can use in every day standards with writing, presenting, speaking about it, so that’s the best part of the course for me.
I did study economics at school; I studied economics A Level standard.
However I studied it in a foreign country so when I came to England and I came to Kingston they brought me into an introductory course of economics as a module and that really helped bringing me up to the English standard of economics.
The types of resources I found available and helpful at Kingston University is definitely the Library; it’s open 24/7, so if you are a night owl like me and like to study in the evenings you can go by and spend the whole night working in the Library.
KPMG has been named a leader in Forrester Wave's quarterly Business Technology Information report.
The report aims to see which businesses are using technology to transform their sectors both by implementing existing technology and developing new innovations.
Rob: Millions of people die every year for a stupid reason; they are just too poor to stay alive.
According to the world health organization, 22,000 people die each and every day from poverty.
Now to save those lives would cost the developed world about sixty-six billion dollars annually.

" Say "I'm not interested in your opinion, I want facts

And they'll try to detract you
They'll say "It will kill incentive

Hi I am Peter O'Grady Today I would like to talk to you about Student Loans.
I think what we have to look at here is why these loans are available in the first place and can i apply for one of these unsecured loans if i have bad credit?
These unsecured loans are government funded and are for higher educational graduates within the UK.
Why are these available?
Well Students are being asked to pay for their own tuition fees, normally at a cost of approximately £3000 per annum, funding is difficult for most people let alone students, so for a student to go to university and pay out of their own pocket can be very demanding on any savings they have or even their parents.
The government have set up these schemes to make it affordable for students to carry on their higher education and achieve their goals and ambitions.
So what is involved in getting funding for a graduate?
When a graduate knows they have been accepted for a University, they can apply to the student loans company, when the unsecured loan has been accepted, the student can expect to receive the funds in three payments spread across the year into their bank account when the university has confirmed that the student is attending the course, because this is a government funded scheme all unsecured loans should even be accepted for people with bad credit.
Everybody is invited, we will create it together
It's not a fixed and finished model and just a calculation
That's the first point: to believe, to trust in what we are thinking, and that we can do it
And then it's for me, related to direct democracy
There's a lack in the world of the role of democracy: we have to renew it
And then, how does it work - financially, for example - is that you can imagine, if there's an unconditional basic floor for everybody, then wages can decrease, about the [basic income's] amount
So wages and all other incomes do no longer have the task to [fund] livelihood, they no longer have this task to ensure existence
That's taken over by an unconditional basic income we give each other
Now, something that you don't want to do with regard to humor.
I'm going to call this: Don't Telegraph Your Humor.
What that means is announcing to your audience (or repeating to your audience, or going over and over again to your audience), 'Hey, I'm going to tell you a really funny story." That's setting you up for failure.
You are looking at Absorb Health's Cordyceps Mushroom Extract.
Cordyceps mushroom is traditionally used to treat sexual dysfunction and fertility in Chinese medicine, but it also has many immune modulating properties.
It also has been shown to increase time to fatigue; decrease biomarkers of stress; and increases testosterone secretions from cells.
All Absorb Health products come with free shipping, a money back guarantee, and one day handling.

Hi, I am Dr. Charles Grimes and I am speaking on behalf of Expert Village about how to deal with the day of your theatrical audition.
Timing your monologue is not a good thing to do the day of the audition or even the day before the audition.
It is quite possible as you run through your rehearsal process that the time you thought your monologue is going to take in performance is different from what it is right now.
So, have someone with you, have a stopwatch, have a clock, and be able to time out exactly how long your beautiful, brilliant monologue takes in performance.
Know that, if you are asked for one minute monologue that is going to be exactly or no more than one minute.
I was raised in an emotionally disturbed environment.
It is a long story, but in short, this distorted environment caused me to lose myself.
I lost the sense of who I was.
I utterly lost confidence in my own self.
I felt terrible about myself for a very long time.
Of course I resorted to spirituality to find some rest and peace.
While spirituality opened my eyes to new ways at looking at things, it did not help me get my sense of self back.
Then I decided to develop the iZone Technology in the hopes that the Grace energy will “fix” all my problems.
Unfortunately Grace energy did not zap me into healing.
What I did notice was that Grace energy was tremendously helping me grow into my own self.
Realizations and new ideas started to come to me at a rapid pace.
Eventually I realized that Grace’s intention was not to zap me into healing, but rather help me grow into my own self so that I can create miracles on my own.

SECRETARY KERRY: Hello everyone.
I’m sorry that I wasn’t able to be with you in person today, but I thank Minister Alfano and the Government of Italy for hosting this gathering, and I look forward to seeing many of you in New York in September, if not sooner.
Today, I just want to make a quick couple of observations.
The first is that we are going to win the fight against violent extremism.
That doesn’t mean we’re going to eliminate it completely or overnight.
It does mean that the forces that drive terrorism today are not sustainable over time.
Young people in large numbers may be lured, brainwashed or even bribed into leaving their homes to join militant extremist groups, but the reality – at least for most – is never going to match their expectations.
So we should have confidence in ourselves and in the power of the values and institutions we represent.
The terrorists should know that we cannot be intimidated; we will not be defeated; and we will not be provoked into actions that damage our cause.
But confidence is no grounds for complacency.
Max: In today's episode, we're talking about a fundamental dilemma that prevents you from making more money and growing your business
Hi there, I'm Max Simon and welcome to the Big Vision Show
This is all about how you can reach more people and thrive financially
Now, if you're having lots of dialogues lately with entrepreneurs that are striving to grow their business and what we see over and over again is this fundamental thing that's preventing you, let's say, from making more money and growing your business
So here's what it is
First, let's start with some context
So, on one side of the equation you want people to value what you do for them to buy your services, to compensate you well for them, to be hungry for it, and also to really see the value of it

On the other side, you have means that you need to invest in whether it's staff or mentors or technology or something else that you need in your life specifically to help you, let's say in this case, grow your business
Now, here's the correlation that most people don't see
Most of the time, when it comes to you investing in what you need, people look for deals
They ask for favors
They haggle around the price; they say things are too expensive
They just avoid working with the best people in the world
They avoid investing at the highest possible level
Now here's where this starts to connect the dots
On the other side, you're wanting people to do that with you
You're wanting them to invest at the highest level
You're wanting them to value your work and just say "yes"
So, all of a sudden, there's a fundamental disconnect; a misalignment at the core of everything you are doing and that's often why people wonder: "Why aren't people investing in a way that I want them to?" So, here's two things you can do to change this dynamic not only so that it shifts energetically but so that you really become the kind of person that's walking your talk
First and foremost, be willing to seek out the best in the world and work with those people
Again, whether they are on your team, whether they're mentors, or whether it's a group of people, seek out the best and invest at that particular level because that not only demonstrates how willing you are to get the help that you need, but, by working with the best, it also insures that you get much better results
The second thing that you must do is invest in what you need
Like, be willing to say: "I can't do this alone; I don't have all the answers; I need more support" and begin allowing your own investment to circulate out because not only on the energetic level does that shift things but, again, having that help gets you better results
So, I'd love to hear from you

In this video I'm going to talk a little bit about a problem that a lot of our prospects have been voicing to us, and this is "what has happened to their rankings, and why has it happened to them?" So what we've discovered over the last two years since 2011, Google has actually updated their ranking algorithm 71 times
What this means is that what used to work for SEO and what used to work to promote websites to get them to beat their competition no longer is helpful
So, what is it that you can do to find out what's going on behind the scenes on your website to make a big difference to allow you to regain the traffic that you once had
There has been three major updates of the 71 updates that have made the biggest impact on the way that websites rank
The first one is Panda, the second one is Penguin, and the third one is Hummingbird
You may have heard of these updates in the past and you may have noticed that your rankings have fluctuated a lot over the last little while
Panda addresses what's on your website
Is the quality of the content there? Is it not there? Are all your tags and everything that you're doing appropriate? The second one is Penguin
Penguin addresses how your website is linking to other sites and even what they're doing
So even if the content and everything is perfect on your site, it may not be perfect on the site's that you are linking to and that's going to effect your rankings as well
Google Analytics is a great way to address what's going on on your particular site
The problem is that it falls short when you're trying to address what's happening on the other sites that you're connected with
And the third one is Hummingbird
Hummingbird addresses how your website works in context with the other sites around them and in context with the words on your site
So if you've woven in key words on your website in a way that's not contextual accurate that's actually going to hurt you as well
So there's a couple of major factors that you want to take into consideration before taking your next steps
You may be interested in this report if you have experienced any problems, if you're looking to invest in the near future in your SEO marketing strategy, or if you've found that you have a dip in traffic and you don't know why
This report is going to show you the ways that you need to change your website before investing in your next steps
It's going to give you a solid foundation to stand on to make sure you're getting the most of your marketing investment
These reports are going to give you all of the tools that you need to establish your website in the structure that it needs to be so that you can get ahead
What is Hip Hop?
Well a lot of people want to know and a lot of people will never find out but to me hip hop is more than just music, it is a way of life, it's a culture.

There is really nothing that will guarantee that you will get results, but there are a number of things that you can do regarding your direct mail campaign to optimally get the best results possible.
That includes understanding which list to use, what message to put on your card, what the aesthetics should look like, and what the offer should look like.
Also, what is going to happen on the backend.

That website is awful'. So it is important that your website looks the part, is as professional as you are.
&gt;&gt; Hello, this is Greg Dees from the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University reporting from Davos 2010. I think the most exciting development over the next decade is going to be the inclusion of social entrepreneurs in solving many of the world's social problems.
Up to this point, I think there's been a heavy reliance on top-down solutions -- the belief that large-scale institutions and governments can solve these problems with large plans.
We realize now that there's a lot of uncertainty about what's going to work, and about what will solve the problems, and about the kinds of business models and approaches we need.
Social entrepreneurs have been out there working at the grassroots levels developing innovative approaches to do this.
Many of them have had tremendous success.

Hello, my name is Aubrey Wilkerson,  Executive Director at Out Youth in Austin, Texas.
Everyone at Out Youth is still coming to terms with the horrible tragedy that occurred over the weekend in Orlando.
Our thoughts are with our  LGBTQ family there in Orlando, and our entire community worldwide…. struggling to make sense of this terrible act of violence.
We also know, that our community in Central Texas is hurting, particularly the clients we serve and their families.
We want young people and their families to know that they have a safe place in Out Youth to fearlessly be themselves.
And here is the next journal entry: The Lord began.
"I've been waiting for you to let go of everything so I could do it for you, so you wouldn't have to strive or "work" something.
Rather the "baby" would be born naturally.
The seed would push it's way through the soil without effort, timely and naturally.
All in My good timing.
Nothing discourages a person more than hope deferred, and yet that's the very thing I use to work patience and faith into My chosen souls.
Will they trust me?
Will they stand on My promise?
And allow the work of preparation to be done?
If you are a firm or a lawyer looking to grow your practice for the long term, then SEO is the perfect solution for you.
As opposed to pay per click, which is just a short term solution, organic SEO results can improve constantly over time.
You can get a quick surge within 60 to 90 days, have top rankings, but after that find that the more blog posts that you do and the more content that you put out there, and the more best practices that you perform, over time, your traffic continues to grow further and further and further, which means that that amount of incoming leads and incoming phone calls to your practice grows over time organically and produces long-term results that ultimately make you very happy as you grow your practice.

Hello, my name is Benjamin Moonan and I'm a representative with the Pennsylvania Office for the Deaf &amp; Hard of Hearing, ODHH.
With Jerry Penna's recent retirement, I took over Western Pennsylvania.

My main office will continue to be in Johnston.
For now, the Erie office will be open by appointment only.
Right now we're going to talk about what a fajita is and the difference between the fajita really and the difference between that, a burrito, you hear that term, you hear taco, you hear a lot of different terms that have actually like chimichanga and chalupa and some of those terms have actually been created more from above the south of the border like Tex-Mex and those kinds of things.
And we're going to talk about the origin of a fajita in the next segment but I want to talk to you what the difference.
You know, a suit is always going to be your go-to for an interview.
We have a very casual dress within our company but we still expect people to wear suits to an interview and I would say most companies probably would as well.
So ladies if you're in a nice blouse and skirt, a pencil skirt I think that's fine too, but I think a suit is your best bet.
Professional dress is actually really important when you're looking for a job so make sure that you are wearing a suit, if you have one.
Your arms should be covered, if at all possible.
So a suit is definitely the best thing to wear.
Wear comfortable shoes, especially when you're at a career fair setting, because you're going to be walking around the lot.
So if you wear heels that are too tall you're going to have to sit down a lot.
So just make sure you wear comfortable shoes but make sure they go with your professional dress.
This next clip is on whether or not you need security at your convention.
And the answer is absolutely yes.
Now, we know how to measure and compare performance.
And we also know that overall performance improvement requires a careful balance between improving one aspect of the design and not messing up on the other aspects of that design.
Bob: Well, welcome back everyone to Velocity Selling TV
Bob Urichuck, the founder of the Velocity Selling System and I’ve got with me today a Velocity Selling Specialist and CEO of Velocity Sales Training, Matthew Whyatt, down in the Gold Coast in Australia
So, join me in welcoming Matthew
How are you doing Matthew? Matthew: Very well Bob, how are you? Bob: Excellent, excellent
Listen Matthew, the last episode we talked about being buyer focused and we shared with our viewers the importance of the Universal needs of all buyers and how they all work, so that was great
And that was the first step of the three competencies that you have to master in order to get this whole buyer focused system
So, one, we learned how to be buyer focused
The second competency is how to engage buyers
Matthew, how do you engage buyers? Matthew: Well Bob, that’s a great question and that’s exactly how you engage buyers, by asking really questions
Actually this is my very favourite part of the system because this has been the difference between me seeming like a normal sales person, or even anybody that follows our system, seeming like a normal sales person, being actually somebody who is actually buyer focused
Now, when I run workshops, and I know that you’ve run, you’ve run tens of thousands of workshops in your time Bob, but in our time of running workshops, what we always do is we ask people why they ask questions
And we usually get some pretty normal answers
One of the answers that I get is to learn more, to help us understand a better, what the customers need, and I even sometimes break them up into groups and have them discuss on their tables
And you know, I get lots of good answers
But really the one answer is the key to all of this, is for control
And we’re not trying to manipulate the conversation, we’re just trying to manage the time because at the beginning of the conversation we want to understand how much time we have, what we want to achieve, and what we want to make sure that we’re trucking along in an orderly fashion to make sure the buyer actually gets what they want out of the conversation
Bob: Yeah, you got it Matthew and the way I like to explain that is: the buyer feels they’re in control because we’re always working off of their questions
Yet, who should be in control of the sales process? The salesperson? The small business owner? Or the buyer? So obviously it’s important that you’ve got to make the buyer feel important and that they’re in control and once they feel in control, guess what? They’re buying, you don’t have to sell them a thing

In the previous episode we talked about the Universal needs of buyers

Matthew: And that’s to be understood, to be comfortable, to feel informed, to feel welcomed, and the only way to actually genuinely do that in your business or in a sales prescription or presentation is to ask really great, quality questions
Bob: You got it
You know what Matthew, let’s save that one for the next episode because we’ve got so much to share with people in one area that I think it’s worth another episode
So, stay tuned and we’ll get into more engaging questions on our next episode which I believe will be episode 45

Bob: Excellent! We’ll see you next week
Matthew: See you Bob, bye-bye

Hi everyone!
Susan here bringing you today's e-tip and today I thought I would talk a little bit about Facebook.
As you may know Facebook has recently changed its algorithms yet again and it has decreased the amount of people that are actually seeing the post that we post to our Facebook page and so what we need to do as entrepreneurs is counteract that the best we can and there's two things that I wanted to tell you about today.
All questions today come from the another71
com Facebook page and Daniel asks, "How do I improve my test scores for the sims
"I've gotten a 68 in FAR, but I was comparable "in all areas except simulations
"When I took the test, I ran out of time and I was "only able to complete three and a half of the seven
"Please help, I only have one more shot "before I lose two of the three exams that I have passed
" Well, time management on simulations is critical, and it's a common pitfall that people run into
Basically, they spend so much time on their multiple choice questions and there might be a few questions that they just cannot get over because they can't figure out the answer and so they just spend like five minutes on it, and you can't do that
Especially for regulation, that's extremely important
The process of finding the right investor is not an easy one.
I think it really begins in understanding who are the investors that are going to be attracted to what you do.
So, for example, you can go out and find investors that like your domain.
They have invested in companies in your space, not in a competitor of yours, but in your type of technology or business.
And perhaps, they would have the propensity and the interest to invest in you.
So, making out that list, you can search on Angie's List and CrunchBase and other free data sources out there to find those investors.
The Future Simple, the will form and the going to form or the Present Continuous can be used to express a decisions, arrangements or predictions about the future

A new study from Accenture has found that citizens across the world are concerned about their prospects for retiring.
Although Americans are worried about how they are going to spend their golden years, they are not as concerned as citizens from most other countries.
Accenture found that over 90% of citizens in many developing nations are fearful of their retirement years.

to bring holiness into the world, to be a blessing
When we Nitzavim, when we stand up, we bring blessing into the world
And generations of Jewish leaders before us led the way, Rabbis Heschel and Eisendrath, Al Vorspan, Goodman, Cheney, Schwerner, many, many Jews who lived the dream of racial justice and civil rights 50 years ago
They heard God's call of Nitzavim, and they led the Jewish people as allies and as partners for the important work of racial justice in American
And so it was that one such leader, Kivie Kaplan, challenged our movement
He was the president of the NAACP
Now the next thing I want to talk about is actually, for me, one of the most difficult things when I am teaching a large class and that is handling the paperwork.
You obviously have to have students do assignments and do work, but you've got all these hundreds of papers that you have to deal with.
Several things that you can do to help minimize the difficulty in this is have travel folders.
Each student has a folder with their name on it and they have to turn their work in, and you turn their work back to them, in this folder.
I think that works really, really nice.
You can also use color coding.

The way forced labour works in the world today is very different from the way it worked in the 1930s, that it's very much a private sector problem, 90% of those in forced labour are in the private sector.
What this study does is for the first time not only reaffirm the size and scale of the 21 million people who are involved in forced labour and victims of it -- but it also puts an economic value on that and breaks it down in a way that even a private sector company can appreciate that this encompasses many industrial sectors and accounts for about a third of the overall profits globally.
This has value because I can go to our supply chain and procurement people but I can also go to organisations like the Global Business Coalition against trafficking and saying this study validates why we have to work very hard on this.
What's evident is that the ILO needs to reinvigorate its action  against forced labour by coming up with a supplemental instrument that fills the implementation gaps in terms of protection, prevention and remedy for victims of forced labour so it has significant policy implications.
When you have 21 million people engaged in forced labour, it will not end tomorrow but collectively, the only way it will end is if we all work together to solve the problem.
When you're working with routers, you're working with firewalls, you're working with other devices.
One of the challenges you have is that you're providing very sensitive security information to those devices.
You don't want anybody to have access to that, except for you and the other security professionals in your environment.
Every device works a little bit differently on how it stores data, and how it secures data.
So you'll want to look at your router, or your firewall, or your switch, to determine-- how is that information stored, and how can I communicate to that device in a way that's not going to provide a lot of data in the clear that somebody might be able to see.
Very often, in fact, you'll find that devices on your network still have the default username and password on them.
You'll see this a lot for people's home routers.
They don't think of changing them.

Username-- administrator, login-- administrator.
It's a very, very common thing, unfortunately, to see this-- even in some of the largest networks in the world.
So you really have to go through and audit, make sure that you have changed all those passwords.
It's so quick to pass by that when you're installing a device for the first time.
You also have to think about how you're communicating to the device.

Hello, my name is Mikkel.
I'm from Denmark from the  Technical University of Denmark and I study Biotechnology.
The Merida Summer Program consists  in a Spanish course  and a Mayan  community program.
The Spanish classes  were everyday with homework and practice talks.
I enjoy a lot these classes.
The other subject was about to visit an small community were we help the people to learn about nutrition and physical exercise  and things they didn't know before.
It was a really great experience to get to know a completly different culture from my country  and Mexico and Europe.
I decided to sign up to this program because  I wanted to learn Spanish and have a month  to get used to Mexico and the culture  before I started  the academic semester at Tec.
I enjoyed a lot this program.
[music] I love the option of PrEP because it makes me feel like I'm protected from something that has stigmatized my community
It's a big plus for me because to be able to know that I take prep, and take it faithfully that I don't necessarily have to worry about getting HIV
It doesn't protect from other STIs but HIV is one of the biggest diseases among black trans women, and to know that I am protected
JP Rangaswami JP: Yes I think China will actually help pull us out of the economic crisis we're in, but for reasons that may be different from what is perceived.
Fundamentally, we need innovation to get us out of this crisis.
We can't use the paradigm of the old or rules of the old in order to be able to solve the problems of the old.
Innovation is key and I think that the role that China plays because talent knows no voters is going to be absolutely critical.

Hello and welcome to your online Sociology course.
My name is Mitra Hoshiar and I will be your instructor for this class.
Let me introduce myself and I want to give you a few tips about the course.
I was born and raised in Iran.
Right after I earned my B.A.
in Sociology  from Tehran University in 1992, I immigrated to United States to pursue my education.
Then I earned my M.A.
in Sociology and doctoral degree in Educational Leadership and Policy Studies.
My career in teaching started with my first tutoring job in high school followed by teaching at many different places.
Since 2005, I have been teaching Sociology at LA Pierce College.
I love teaching, because I appreciate the fact that students are absolutely eager to learn and they are also energetic.
Hi my name is Meagan Leonard I'm a sophomore here at University of Kentucky I'm studying Integrated Strategic Communication, or ISC Whenever people ask me what my major is I always get kind of nervous if it's in any sort of like icebreaker or just getting to know me because if you're not too familiar with ISC it's kind of hard to explain in just a few minutes or if you just do an icebreaker in class
Most the time I sometimes lie and I say that it's a mix between marketing and communications because that's the easiest way how to explain it but, overall it's a very broad major and I'm excited to see what's going to happen in the next few years with it For my fun fact I'm going to tell you about when I was in the third grade, I was featured in the film We are Marshall Which is a movie based on a true story about how the football team from Marshall was coming back from a game in Florida It was rainy and really dark that night and the plane crashed into the mountainside in Huntington, which was only a few miles from the airport
In 2006 producers and directors came to Marshall and filmed about how the school recovered from the plane crash and how the football team was rebuilt
That day I went to work with my mom and I was walking to the student center and some guy asked us if I wanted to be featured in a movie so I think any nine-year-old would have said yes and I did and she let me
I was in the scene whenever Matthew McConaughey was looking out the window and people were shouting "We Are

Marshall!" to get the team really hyped up because the reporters were doubting if the football team could get started up again
This is Patrick Munro, answering the question, can I open a traditional IRA, with a lump sum cash deposit?
The answer to that is yes and no.
Should victory visit Hillary Clinton’s door it shall not come bearing a mandate for a grand new vision or bold new policy direction
History will simply note that voters found her less objectionable than her opponent
Having stuck with her, the Bernie Sanders wing of the democratic party will want its due
And it will be difficult for Mrs
Clinton to make them happy
They are a populist bunch, hell bent on massive redistribution of wealth, and not interested in fighting new wars in the middle east, or another cold war with Russia
Clinton cannot please the Sanders wing without alienating those on Wall Street that helped pay her bills
She cannot pay for the Sanders wing wish list without breaking her no-new-taxes promise to the middle class
The Republican Party has already cracked
The evangelical wing has lost its moral compass and shed its credibility as the arbiter of the good and the holy
The establishment Wing and their neocon allies are already exiting the Republican tent
The blue collar, working class wing that has been a reliable Republican voting block may soon be looking for looking for a new tent
The wings of the Republican coalition are so deeply divided on entitlements, trade, immigration, when and where to fight wars that even a Trump victory will not again unite them
This election has laid raw the stark divisions inside the American Political parties
A change and a realignment is inevitable
What has not, and will not change is this: An entire generation of Americans have been left behind by our current political parties; their piece of the American dream denied
They will soon be looking for someone willing to speak for them

I'm Samantha Deutscher for InvestmentPitch.com Dundee Corporation, which trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol DC.A, has closed a strategic investment in CNSX, operator of the Canadian National Stock Exchange and Pure Trading.
In conjunction with the investment, for which the terms were not released, Mr. Ned Goodman, President and CEO of Dundee, has joined the CNSX Board as Deputy Chairman.
Thomas Caldwell, President and CEO of Urbana Corporation (TSX:URB.A), and CNSX Chairman stated, "We are pleased to welcome a business leader of Ned's stature to the Board.
With his contribution we expect to accelerate the steady growth CNSX has seen this year, as we continue to enhance CNSX's role as the 'Exchange for Entrepreneurs' in Canada." Ned Goodman commented, "I have been impressed for some time with CNSX's approach to helping entrepreneurs access the public capital markets in Canada.
The CNSX model reduces the time and expense companies face in going public, and in maintaining a listing, along with a high level of continuous disclosure.

It makes for true holiday grilling.
I’m quite an avid photographer.
And for the first time all of my photographs aren’t locked up in my digital files.
Now I’m actually printing a number of them.
And I do some printing myself.
But for the 4x6s and the 5x7s I went out seeking, okay, what’s the best solution for me.
As far as shopper marketing, and ultimately the use of digital tools in the shopper marketing process, keep your eye on Proctor and Gamble.
They’re always about five years ahead of everybody else in terms of how they-- how they go to market.
And they were the first to really exalt the retail space as what they call the first moment of truth.
Their chairman talks about there being two moments of truth in consumer product marketing.
He even calls poets liars because their representations of reality are by nature far removed from the truth
However poets may try, their poetry is a poor imitation of an imitation of a reality, and so these representations are not to be valued more than Truth itself
Art is dangerous because it does not portray reality as it is and because it serves the ideals of its created, so it is to be banished from Plato's Republic
Fortunately, another great Greek philosopher did not agree with these accusations and came to the rescue of art
Aristotle, in his Poetics, tried to refute Plato's argument
He said that poets do not claim to portray reality as it is
rather, they portray reality as it should be
We would hope that everyone would be able, boys, girls, little children, older people, realize that when we partake of the bread and when we partake of the water, it's in remembrance of the atoning sacrifice of the Son of God
Unfortunately, one year on, we have to report that the situation per young people in the labour market has not gotten better.
In fact with the economic crisis proving to be much more deep rooted than initially thought, it is unlikely that the situation in the youth labour market is going to improve any time soon.
We have the youth in the developed economies which were hit particularly hard by the economic crisis.
Here, the youth unemployment rate and the youth unemployment number in 2010 were higher than ever before measured.
At the same time, the youth unemployment rate between 2009 and 2010 continued to increase, this makes the region unique.
Another distinct group of young people in developing economies, here we have a very different situation because very few young people can afford to be unemployed.
So the youth unemployment rate is not the indicator to focus on here.
Rather we talk about working poverty, we talk about vulnerable employment.
Most young people take up whatever work is available to them, often time very poor working conditions and at poverty wages.
Part-time employment for example has sky-rocketed in recent years.
Now part-time employment in itself is not necessarily a negative thing especially when young people are combining work and studies.
However the recent magnitude of the increase hints at the fact that part-time employment has been taken up as an involuntary action.
Many young people are finding that they can only find part-time and temporary employment.
Sustained investments in young people are what we need now more than ever.
Long-term investment in the education and training system for example; Creative fiscal policy that will subsidize youth employment; these are some of the examples of the solutions that are being called for.
- The great majority of students have debt when they graduate from college.
The average for a student going to a public school is about $26,000 of debt.
For a private school it's around $29,000 of debt.
- Taking out loans to pay for your education is a highly, highly, personal decision making process.
And it gets complicated because I think families tend to advise students and sometimes that advice is very helpful and other times it's kind of antagonistic because it just adds another pressure that you have to keep in mind.
And sometimes the pressure is to take out loans because no one has money right now, or in other times it's we're not taking out any loans because we have no money to pay it back.
Which might mean that if you're not going to take out loans, you need to pay everything right now.
Which means you might have to work a whole lot more, somehow, in order to pay for your education.
And so my biggest advice is to think very practically about can you actually pay back those loans?
- Always have an understanding of what is your overall indebtedness.
I see students get into trouble because they just keep taking out loans every year and then it's a big surprise for them at the end of four years how much they owe.
So you should know how much you've borrowed, you should know what that means in terms of monthly payments when you graduate.
What's the dollar amount that you're going to be responsible for?
And have an understanding of basic budgeting.
What does that mean in terms of what will your lifestyle need to be when you graduate.
So don't just take out those loans blindly.
Know what the monthly payment obligation is going to be, what that means for you once you're out in the world of work.

Now for example, if they're in the pharmaceutical industry, they believe that the attackers might be after some intellectual property for a new drug they're developing
Then they can share it with their own pharmaceutical community and maybe nobody knows about it and so they've given advance warning from one organization to another or maybe someone else has seen something quite similar If you look at the security industry as a whole, what you find is that we are understaffed because that skill set is rare

At this point you've likely reached out to my office and you may very well have your first consultation set up with my firm
At that consultation or case evaluation, you'll either be meeting with myself or a trusted member of my team
The meeting will be entirely confidential
What you say to us will not leave our office
If you're referred to us by another attorney or a friend of the firm, we will not share your information with that other attorney or that referral source in any way, shape, or form without your permission
The purpose of the consultation and case evaluation is for you to come to the office, for you to feel if you're comfortable with us, and for us to feel if we're comfortable with you moving forward
In all likelihood, we're gonna want to discuss what you believe happened, what you believe the police reports will say, what you believe the alleged victim, if there is a victim in this case being alleged would say if we were there interviewing them, and we want you to bring a couple of things to that meeting
One is, first and foremost, we want you to bring an open mind because we know that people have certain preconceptions or misconceptions about attorneys and attorneys' offices when charged with a crime
So once you come in there understanding that our job is to evaluate and get as much information as possible
So we ask that you don't be reluctant to give us that information, because we need that information in order to evaluate the case, to quote a fair and accurate fee for our services
When you come into the office, we ask that you bring any bail paperwork you have
If you've been arrested, you should have a bail slip, which will show your bail amount, the charges you were booked into jail at, as well as any future court dates
If you have a citation from a traffic ticket or something like that where you were cited and released, we'd ask that you bring that
If you happen to have your discovery, police reports, all that information
If you case is currently ongoing, then we'd ask that you bring that or send a copy to our office in advance of your meeting so we can be most prepared when you come in and meet with us
And what you'll find is when you meet with either myself or a staff member, is that we may not be the cheapest
I guarantee you, we're not going to be the cheapest attorney you're probably going to meet with
We might not be the most expensive
We might be, I don't know
But what I can guarantee you is you're going to be handled with class, you're going to be handled with professionalism, and that's nothing pretty much less than what you should expect when interviewing with a criminal defense attorney or their firm
We look forward to having you come into our office for a free consultation
There is no obligation to that consultation
If you hire us, fantastic
I look forward to representing you and working with you in the future

I'm based out of Hong Kong.
I run social media strategy for Ogilvy and I'm a blogger.
And the question of whether the political problems or the economical problems are going to be the biggest ones going ahead.
Question: What would you consider to be the most impactive statements by the Supreme Court of Canada in Moore, having in mind what you had just stated?
Answer: The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that adequate special education for students with severe disabilities is not, and I quote, "a dispensable luxury".  But rather, and again I quote from the judgement, "it is a ramp that provides access to the statutory commitment to education made to all children in British Columbia.
In other words, what they're saying is that there is a legal obligation to provide those services, it is not an option.
My name is Michael Mann-Stock
I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area
And I just graduated from the MSW Program
One of the main reasons that I wanted to be a social worker was the advocacy component
I've always really believed in social justice
And prior to going to USC, I spent time in the District Attorney's Office in San Francisco
I work for Poway Unified School District finding adults with barriers to employ them with jobs
I've been able to take all my previous experiences and blend them together in what I'm doing
And USC really made that possible through this program
A lot of what I believe in is getting the deep in there and fighting
And so when I see a cause that I feel passionate about, then I'll stand up and do it
It's really amazing the commitment that I've seen
So it's really cool to have that kind of support
Give it a chance-- give the technology and the experience a chance
It is a little different
It does take some getting used to
But once you do get yourself acclimated, it's an amazing experience

The real problem we face is not customer  fraud but the complexity of our products.
Especially in the investment of capital  in life insurance, we find the terms and conditions are so complex – because the  regulator stipulates this by the way – that the customers do not know what they  are getting and what it all costs, and this  is where we would like to make progress.
I would say that the next decade in  this industry, will show that the products  need to become simpler, easier to understand,  and that they need to become cheaper.
So, in a world where interest rates are decreasing and capital income is becoming  more volatile – greetings from our central bank  who are trying to enforce negative interest –  people only save if what they get in return is in relation to what they have resisted consuming.
If you put your money under your mattress because you get money taken off you when you put it  into the bank account, you would prefer to buy a jumper or a bag or a computer instead.

Hello friends, subscribers, Mom, Dad, my wife who told me not to get on an airplane with two hours of no-flying experience
The gentleman behind me is Walt
He's with me for safety reasons, although as you can see from this, I'm the one in the cockpit, these are my hands
So this is great, I'm flying an airplane

SUNDAR BHARADWAJ: Finance has its role and place in the organization.
Finance tells you where to invest and how to invest.
Strategy tells you what business to be in.
Marketing's role is once the firm sort of decides what business to be in, how to compete in those markets.
I wasnít prepared for it and it just caught me and I froze up
Now, the reason I told you that story is actually Iím leading this to part two so weíve talked about preparation

Do you notice how when I told you that story about the consulting interview, you immediately probably tuned a bit more into this video
Thatís because I grabbed your attention
I shared with you an experience, which is true by the way, but itís one that you can relate to because youíve locked up
Youíve had instances in which having somebody talk to you in a language that youíre just totally lost on
So donít be afraid to find a way to bring the audience in
One of the best ways is a story and youíre going to need to do this every 10 to 15 minutes because you canít just give people tons of information

where you're going to mark it on your calendar, and you're going to make it a priority
And the best way to do this is actually to find time that you already have, rather than trying to eliminate, like, grocery shopping or hanging out with friends, or whatever the case may be
Find time you already have, and schedule in there
And make sure you have plenty of time to accomplish the tasks that you need to do, in order for you to reach the purpose of why you're doing this on YouTube in the first place

if a client enjoys working with you, they're much more likely to pay you on time
In the client-freelancer relationship, just like in any relationship, communication is key
It's especially important, too, if the client is in another country, as many of mine are
You can't just meet them for coffee and chat about the project, you're dealing most of the time via video calls or via email, so communication- clear communication- is really important, and it's always better to over-communicate than under-communicate
And now an interesting question to ask is how do people actually set prices in real life? Well, why don't look around and ask? If you ask your, let's say, restaurant uncle, he would probably say "I take the cost something on top so that I will earn some money" and this is what we call markup pricing
Is he earning profits? Of course
The maximum? Well, you may not be very sure
Here look at this diagram
First you draw the AC curve, then the AR curve
Where is the profit maximized? That is where the distance between the two is maximum
And where is the difference between the price and cost the most? So, it's here where it's the mark we have aligned
However, the uncle may simply take the cost and add some additional amount on top
In this case he might just produce here or here

I definitely knew I wanted to go abroad and I knew I could do that durning my 3B term so I did that and they also started talking about internships, that is something that has to be done in third or forth year
And I knew that if I decided to go to the UK, that my term would be cut short so I would have to find an alternate route
Being in Europe and loving Europe so much, from my previous experiences of being there, I knew that I really wanted to stay

Hi, I’m Jack Canfield, co-creator of “Chicken Soup for the Soul” book series, and director of Canfield Training Institute.
I am here to recommend to you Hale Dwoskin and The Sedona Method.
About three years ago, I was introduced to The Sedona Method.
Took a weekend workshop with my wife and my son.
And it literally transformed the way we deal with feelings, interactions, when angers comes up.
This is Governor Steve Beshear ... About Kentucky I recently made my sixth visit to the BIO international convention where I met with high-tech startups, bioscience and healthcare entrepreneurs.
We're encouraging them to move their ideas, companies and jobs to the Commonwealth.
Studies show that entrepreneurs like these are helping drive the economy in Kentucky.
In fact, the May issue of Fast Company Magazine ranked Kentucky second among states for its growth rate of startup companies.
This success is due to our ongoing commitment to support entrepreneurs with innovative products and services in order to keep Kentucky's economy on the right track.
One reason for our success is our support of Kentucky's small high-tech businesses, and those willing to relocate in Kentucky, as they explore the potential of their technology and the ability to commercialize it.
Our SBIR-STTR program matches federal awards and is the most comprehensive of its type in the nation.
LAWRENCE GRANDPRE: I'm Lawrence Grandpre, from Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle.
We're at the William Porter trial.
JAISAL NOOR: So Lawrence, talk about your reaction to the jury selection, as well as the opening arguments by the prosecution.
GRANDPRE: Jury selection was really interesting.
The defense actually used all six of their strikes on black people.
The majority of which on men of color, many of them younger.
Which conforms to many peoples' fears that young men of color may be seen as biased against the police and therefore be excluded from the trial.
Now, the actual demographic from the jury represented Baltimore.
Two-thirds black, one-third white.
We obviously don't know any of the details of the individuals in particular.
I do think the strike pattern of the defense, though, is the big story of the jury selection, while the defense--or the prosecution, excuse me, used their strikes on a diversity of folks, the defense only used their strikes on black folks, predominantly younger black folks.
NOOR: And the prosecution alleges that Freddie Gray said he couldn't breathe, and William Porter the defendant failed to do his duty as an officer to provide medical care.
Before you get started, absolutely critical, you have to have a bank account for the business.
I think you should have an entity for the business, hands down.
If you start without an entity for the business, then when you have an entity it starts getting confusing about did I pay for that out of my own check book, did I pay for that out of the business, and reconciling the two is very frustrating even if it's only a month of an overlap time.
So the suggestion is to set up an entity.
Also as you ... certainly, there's a metaphorical way of saying to yourself,. I've kinda given birth to this new thing called the business and now I have to think about what the responsibilities are in terms of taxes and in terms of the profits that we're making and the cost that we're experiencing and to be able to reconcile all that in one bank account and able to have a vision or clarity on what your business is doing.

And, the cash is important, right, because it's what allows students to pay back their student loans that they had to take out for degree completion to begin with
This is a definition of success that the media often is telling to students
How hard should your Rollga be? Should it be soft? Should it be very firm? There's a few things to this, number one if you go and ask a massage therapist to give you a soft, theaputic, circulatory type massage, you are going to go with something lower on the charts like your MalaPearl, something more soft
If you are going to be more aggressive and you go into the massage therapist and say, "I want a sports massage, use your elbows, really dig into the tissue
" Then you are going to go ahead and look into something more firm and aggressive like the Pro Series
Now there are some inbetween there, and I put together a nice little chart to help you decide which density is best for you
But there's also some other things to think about
If you are somebody that is just sitting on a chair using the Rollga, you are going to want something a little more firm, or if you are using the wall, technically if you are leaning against a wall you are going to want more pressure because you are using less body weight
Now if you are new to foam rolling I would suggest starting with something more soft and progressing your way up to something more firm
Some also like to use a soft Rollga for sensitive and tender areas, and they like to use something a little bit more firm to be a little bit more aggressive in others

The independent directed film as a director.
As a director there is so many things that you need to cover, that you need to be aware of.
As I've gone over them in detail, but just to do a brief summary you have got to be prepared for the challenges that you will face as a director.
There is a lot of glamor and glitz that goes with movies, but unbenounst to most people movies are so difficult.
They are harder than most jobs because of the hours, because of the stress and because of of all that's required of the people involved, but more than anybody the director has the toughest job.
So, you've had to take out loans to get through school.
A lot of us have, and all I can say is if it weren't for loans, I wouldn't be here.
The time is soon coming when I'll have to be paying them back.
I've looked into it, and I’ve discovered that there are six options I can choose from.
With some of these options, you pay a fixed amount every month.
Other options allow your monthly payments to increase as your income does.
Visit the financial aid office for more information.
It’s possible to have your student load debt deferred due to situations like unemployment, military service, or returning to school.
You may also be eligible to have them cancelled for example if you become a teacher, a firefighter, or work in the public sector.
Just go to www.studentaid.ed.gov and look for “public service loan forgiveness” to learn more.

People with similar interests are connecting, whether it be a passion for motorcycle riding, music, collections, there is a way to get groups of people together with digital communication technologies, no matter where they live or at what time of day they live
Networking has become so important that it has integrated into face-to-face conversations
People have come to talk about what one posts on "X" networks or on "X" site
The teaching assistantship that I undertook  lasted for nine months I was working in what's the  equivalent a sixth form  college.
So I was working with age groups from sixteen upwards   and often that would include interacting with  the students in English however, that didn't mean that my German was in anyway  hindered because  it was an opportunity to also have to explain things in German which is probably one of  the most difficult tasks when it comes to using a modern foreign language.
In terms of the activities which I took part in there was lots of things, ranging from sorts of  oral classes, to presentations about English  culture and informing about English culture in general and  it also I often had to  participate in lessons, and plan  lessons for the school and it was a brilliant experience.
In terms of finance I  received  the Aramis  funding, Aramis  grant which you're entitled to as a teaching assistantship as well as the student  and that really helped me out through the year.
Last night, the IDF and the ISA put dozens of Hamas terrorists back in prison including some who were released in the framework of the agreement to return Gilad Shalit.

Remember, each bird will need 2 of them
Good day.
I'm Burns Phillips, commissioner of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development.
Two years ago we began a journey to completely overhaul Tennessee's forty year old unemployment insurance system so that we might improve our serve employers and deliver unemployment benefits to claimants.
It's nearly complete.
The new system or run through the Job4TN.gov website.
Soon you'll be able to go online and handle your claimant responses, as well as any protest or appeals processes.
Now your company will have to register with Jobs4TN.gov in order to use this new system.
Rest assured we've taken many safeguards to keep your information confidential.
Another change will impact companies who have employees on partial layoff.
Those employees will need to register at Jobs4TN.gov and go online each week to certify that they are still out of work.
Now, that's a change it will take some getting used to, but we're here to help through all this.
We're working around the clock to make sure to smooth transition.
Good morning, I'm Anne Lezak, and I'm chair of the Rutland County democrats.
You ask me, how I would decide if I'm a democrat or a republican.
That was really no decision at all for me, I think I was maybe born a democrat.
The democratic values and ideals and goals, resonates so strongly in me, and I think really have for my whole life.
- [Announcer] And now, a Citizens National Bank Newsletter Extra
- Citizens National Bank has always offered Farm Service Agency guaranteed lending, but recently we became a preferred lender with them, which allows us to speed up the approval process
Prior to that, it took us thirty days for an approval through the FSA, but now we can do it in four days
What we're required to submit now is a one page application and a narrative
If we can get two or three years of annual statements, that would be great
Three years of tax returns, so we can kind of average out what the income numbers are
And the different types of loans that we can offer with this are Farm Ownership loans, Operating lines of credit, or Equipment and Capital Improvement needs loans
The benefit to the borrower also allows us on the real estate transactions to offer them a long term real estate loan that's fixed on the rate, different terms that we have now, we can fix a rate up to thirty years
Where prior to that, typically, we'd lock a rate in for a borrower for five years
You know the benefit to that would be that they can mitigate any interest rate risk by locking in and knowing where their payments will be for ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five years up to thirty
Other than the Farm Service Agency loan programs, other options that we have started or are involved with would be through the Farmer Mac Program
They basically have two
There's a Farmer Mac Two which coincides with the Farm Service Agency, that'll give us a fixed rate on their program
They also offer a Farmer Mac One
And the Farmer Mac One is available to any borrower and even if you are a investor owning property and you want to have an option of having a fixed rate on your real estate, we can take you through the Farmer Mac One program and lock that rate in
Another option that we have through the Farm Service Agency is the Beginning Farmer program
And this really allows for a family farm operation to transition real estate from one generation to the next
The way this works or the structure would be that the bank would finance 50% of the deal on our normal terms
Farm Service Agency's portion would be financed for 20 years and currently the rate on that would be 1

The borrower then needs to come up with 5% or have a 5% injection into the process
The loan limit with the Farm Service Agency is $225,000
And the balance of it then can be done with bank funding
To learn more about these programs, visit our Farm Services under the business section of this website

a sigh, nor a thought tainted with the slightest flavor of unhappiness or discontent
All our wishes are gratified, and love reigns eternally and without stint
Never, when on earth, did I conceive that one man could love another as one spirit here loves his brother spirit
The mine and thine are truly the ours, and no spirit is so happy as when he is doing something to make another spirit happier
and then, love between the opposite sexes is so pure and glorified
JEFF BELL: Because there's more fragmentation, because so much media, for instance, is local and regional, that's the problem that is before every planner and buyer.
We're here with Alan Clayton, of Clayton Burnett at the Institute of Fundraising National Convention.
Alan, you've just published a controversial blog post that is a call to action for fundraisers.
Tell us more.
Well, I don't see what's controversial about it Howard.
I just sincerely believe that somebody, probably the Institute of Fundraising, should put aside some budget and launch a media campaign saying we are proud to be fundraisers.There's been so much negative press and offset against that the evidence is that when an entire organisation is proud of its fundraising, it raises more money.
We've got so many people defending, controlling, attacking fundraising that we've become defensive and apologetic and there is nobody out there in the media or talking to trustees and chief executives saying actually, we're very, very good at this.
Millions of people have lives enhanced by giving.
We're the best in the world.
In the last decade we've engaged two million young people for the first time.

I use a power scooter to get around
It aids in my mobility
And if there was a new feature that came out for my scooter they made it more comfortable or functional that'd be great
I'd be all for that
But that doesn't negate my pride in using a scooter or questioning my worth as a human being
The response and impact of those advertisers that have started to engage in on line media to measure their-- the results of that, has been really positive.
Overall I think we are pretty clear that this has been a major step forward for the teaching of this course, and it was a big success.
I mean, firstly we had the students reactions which was overwhelmingly positive.
We also had exam data that we could analyse, and we able to do proper statistical analysis of this, comparing it with exam data from the three years previously, and what we've found, where we controlled the differences among these students, differences in the difficulties of the exams, we found that we've had something like five marks to the average grade of a student, which is quite a big increase, I mean, it's half of the degree class, if you like.
So that was really a positive thing.
But even if you don't believe the exam data that we had, we saw the engagement significantly improved.
I mean, the attendance was so much better throughout the year, and in fact because the attendance was higher and we were asking students to go to twice as many classes, what we found was that over the year students had attended something like three times more classes, of this small problem classes, than they used to.

&gt;&gt; DEANNE HAMILTON: There will be a critical vote in congress very soon on whether to eliminate all federal support for local public TV.
&gt;&gt; KENT WEILAND: Federal funding is an important part of WKAR's budget.
It helps us deliver commercial-free programming that expands children's minds, documentaries like NOVA, American Experience and Frontline, and trusted news programs like NewsHour.
It exposes people of all ages to the worlds of music, theater, dance and art.
TOM MERRITT: The mistake marketers make is that they might think, oh well the consumer is doing this.
I'll just look at this study, and I'll do this formula.

A great birthday speech in fact.
Hi guys, my name is Timea Kalmar.
I came to Kingston University last year with Erasmus scholarship.
JACQUI WILKINSON: I think that consumers are different, and I can talk for myself.
I think that online shopping is a huge thing that probably didn't happen, wasn't really happening.
I don't think I'd really made a purchase online up until about five years ago, or something.
So it's really, really changed.
Welcome to the ManageMyFatigue app v1.3 update.
Can you believe the app has been out for almost three months now!
We continue to make improvements based on our original roadmap and your feedback.
We're very excited about the v1.3 feature updates.
It's obvious that the ManageMyFatigue app is a culmination of many ideas, the original concept and the amazing feedback and suggestions from you.
I hope you'll join me for just a moment to check out the latest features.
The first thing you'll notice are the visual changes.
We've flattened the buttons and added more contrast so the app is visually more appealing.
We also added a direct link to the training videos.
If you haven't checked them out, you might want to because they include some helpful information on using the ManageMyFatigue app.
We've heard your requests and have made some changes to the More screen.
You'll note there is now a place to add prescription medications.
You certainly don't have to include this information, but many of you have requested this feature.
This information is available to you in the Prescription Meds screen and also in the Bedtime Questionnaire.
This way you can check your med list before you answer the, "Did you take your prescription medication today?" question.
Since we're on the Bedtime Questionnaire I should mention that we've added a question about napping- How long did you spend napping today in total?
Thanks to those of you who requested this addition.
Naps are very common and should be considered when evaluating your day.
We've also made a change or two  to the Settings options.
You'll note we've included a Soft reminder sound option and you can now tap each sound option to hear it before you choose it.
We also created a custom vibrate pattern for iPhone users.
If the ManageMyFatigue app is the active app -  meaning that it appears on the screen when the screen is illuminated,  the vibrate pattern will be four short bursts to help you recognize that the ManageMyFatigue app is alerting you.
We also set the default calendar options to Enabled so your attempted tasks will automatically appear in your calendar.
You might wonder how should I be prepared for the day of my hearing
What are some of the things I can do to be the most prepared on the day of the hearing? Well, the first thing is wear comfortable clothes
Do not wear something that is constricting to you or that you're uncomfortable with whatever your everyday clothes are
That's what you should wear to the hearing
This isn't a job interview, you don't need to dress up, go as you do everyday
Jeans are perfectly fine at hearing, sweats are perfectly fine
What you should not do is wear something that it's extremely short or wear a lot of jewelry, a lot of makeup
Other than that you should be fine
Make sure you arrive early
One of the biggest complaints I hear from judges are these people are waiting more than 2 years for hearing and then they are late to their hearing
Make sure well in advance that you know the route that you're going to travel, that if you need a ride that you have lined up a ride, and if you're riding on mass transit that you know what the schedule is so you should arrive at hearing an hour before your hearing
If you arrive an hour before that lets you be familiar with the hearing office itself, it lets you calm down, usually people are anxious the day of hearing and you'll be prepared to testify
The next thing you should do if you take medication ordinarily make sure you've taken your medication prior to your hearing
For example, if you suffer from chronic pain you want to be able to concentrate and focus on what the judges asking you at your hearing and you want to be as comfortable as possible
Another thing you should do is do not be afraid to ask the judge to change positions if you are uncomfortable
If you need to stand because you're in a lot of pain all you do is ask the judge respectfully, "Your Honor, do you mind if I stand?" If you need to stretch your legs or prop your legs on a chair they will allow you to do that
Just ask the judge first prior to adjusting your position
Don't be afraid to take a break
It is very important if you need to take a restroom break that you do so because of you're concentrating on the fact that you need to go to the restroom as oppose to the questions the judge is asking you might answer a question in a way that you ordinarily would not answer because you cannot concentrate and focus upon the questions the judge is asking
And finally, be candid, be frank and answer the judge's questions truthfully
Do not be evasive
You want to give the judge your best testimony on the date of your hearing

Hi, I'm Mark Blocker on behalf of Expert Village.
In this segment we are going to do the conclusion to our vehicle interior lighting maintenance and cleaning video.

Hi, I'm Carmen Lynne with Expert Village, and we're talking about dreams.
Now if you're one of those people that has difficulty remembering your dreams, even though you know you've dreamt but you can't quite remember what you've dreamt, there are some little tips and techniques that I can tell you which will help you.
First off, if the alarm goes off in the morning and it wakes you up, fine.
When you're lying in bed and the alarm's just gone off, do not move.
So don't change your position in the bed.
Stay there in the same position.
The reason being that, it's weird, it's like when you move around it almost kind of knocks the dream out of your head in a strange way.

Douglas and I have been working in the field of thermoelectrics for 10 years, 5 of which have been at Matrix
For the last 50 years, not much progress in thermoelectrics has been made
We decided to take a different approach
Let's check out the lab
We decided to take a systems approach
We're using the most efficient thermoelectric materials available today that have the unique combination of low thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity typically not found in nature
We've paired that up with a thermal design that efficiently moves heat from your body to the environment
Finally, we're using a boost converter to take small thermoelectric voltages to usable levels, that only became available in the past few years
We've done the hard engineering necessary to put all this technology into the watch that you're backing, but we're not stopping there
We're working on the most advanced earth-abundant materials, even better thermal designs, and boost converter circuits that are even more efficient than what's available today
Information technology is playing an increasingly important role in business.

Hey guys what's up welcome to rock gamer your one stop shop for all things Rock Band 4 and Guitar Hero Live related so i want to talk about some of the new rock band news that came out today.
IGN did a featureette Now if you've played the past Rock Band and Guitar Hero games then you'll know that the career mode was really more of an afterthought.
You'd play it once and then you would never return to it because it was the same experience.
Rock Band 4 hopes to change that.
In Rock Band 4 they really want to give you the option of how to become a successful band.
They want you to dictate that story.
If you want to do the corporate gigs and make a lot of money and be a bunch of sellouts you can totally do that or you can just choose to do a different route you know play smaller venues, you know sleep on people's couches and just interact with people over social media and manage that whole aspect so that is a really cool thing they are going to be changing up.
So you can play the career mode multiple times and have a different experience each time and play different gigs each time.
The other thing that is really cool is that the money system is returning so you can use money to buy new instruments, you can use it to upgrade your characters appearance buy clothes that kind of accessories the other thing that's going to be changed is how fans work.
If you played rock band 3 then you'll know that fans had no impact on gameplay.
This time they are going to have an impact on the gameplay.
So the number of fans you basically accumulate can be geographic specific so you maybe playing on the eastern seaboard or on the east coast and you may find that playing in different locations will unlock certain gigs and easter eggs which is a really cool idea.
I think it's really important for everyone to understand that here at the University there can be no tolerance for sexual violence of any kind.
We have a particular concern with what happens to survivors of sexual violence and that they should have the easiest, most respectful way to find support in the University.
And so the protocol and the website that have been developed are an important addition to our practice of dealing with cases of this sort, and to trying to eliminate and wherever necessary address the concerns of people who have survived sexual violence of one sort of another.
If we put ourselves in the place of a survivor and think about what we would want, we would want respect for our concerns, confidentiality, a value-free response to what has gone on, and a clear effort to provide the supports and services that we might want.
Hi, my name is Ryan Crozier, and I use PaySimple for online donations for our non-profit.
And our donors love it because it's set up automatically each month it withdraws a donation from their account and they get a receipt via email, and our bookkeeper loves it because it makes keeping track of the donations very simple.
She logs in and sees all of the  donations in the past month so it's been a great tool for us and PaySimple's support has been awesome, helping us get set up and keep things running smooth.
I'm Megan Edwards for InvestmentPitch.com PI Financial has initiated coverage on Macro Enterprises, symbol MCR on the TSX Venture Exchange.
Analyst Jason Zandberg gives the company a buy rating, and a12-month target of $7.00, a premium of 80% to the $3.88 price the day the report was issued.
The company specializes in the construction and integrity of pipelines and oil and gas facilities.
Based in Fort St.
John, British Columbia, the company provides its services throughout Western Canada from Manitoba to BC.
Macro's financial results have been very strong over the past four years and have accelerated over the last 18 months.
Revenue has grown from $48 million in 2009 to $148 million in 2012, substantially through organic efforts.
The company's clients include, Enbridge, Talisman, TransCanada, Cenovus, Nexen, Spectra, AltaGas and Pembina.
British Columbia's liquid natural gas development could result in several multi-million dollar contracts for pipeline and facilities construction business for Macro, once final investment decisions are announced.
Pipelines connecting Western Canada's gas producing regions to the coast, for ultimate delivery to Asia, will encourage further development of natural gas resources which includes associated well-site water lines, natural gas flowlines and processing facilities.
PI Financial expects revenue to grow 37% for the full year of 2013, and 23% for 2014. A significant growth constraint for this market is access to equipment and labour and Macro is in an enviable position with respect to both these variables.
Analyst Jason Zandberg stated, "Given Macro's revenue and earnings growth profile we believe Macro shares are still significantly undervalued.
Well now that we've got the exercise part out of the way let's return to the details of property three and see what it means to faithfully represent that have the refinement faithfully represent the specification.
In fact we have to check three things.
There's three criteria that we have to look at.
First of all, is the refinement adequate?
Now to answer some of your questions coming in through the website and our Facebook page.
This one is really interesting.
"We're diligent when it comes to physical safety, but I'm interested to know, as a business owner, how I should approach the mental health of my staff." It's a really, really good question.
First of all, it's important to think about the mental health of your employees as being part and parcel of running a good business.
Aside from any legal responsibilities, mentally healthy workplaces are also more productive, obviously.
The people in them are happier, they take less sick leave, and are more committed, which is better for your bottom line.
Now as an owner or manager, it's important that you're conscious of how staff are travelling, and understand the signs and symptoms that could indicate that they're doing things a bit tough.
Now you don't have to be an expert, but it's wise to speak with that person if you are concerned.

Alright, we're talking about content and the things that you're looking for.
The last thing you want to take a look at is the conclusion, and this is a big one because, especially in speech classes, this is where people tend to drop the ball for several reasons.
Either they don't quite understand how to write one, or maybe by that time in the speech they're like so over it that they just have to sit down before they throw up.





The novel commences by Janie returning to Eatonville, Florida
The townspeople note Janie’s newly found confidence after leaving Eatonville with her third husband, Tea Cake
Janie’s first marriage was to a man, Logan Killicks, her grandmother, Nanny, encouraged her to marry, not because she loved him but rather because he could provide her with security and a social status
For years, Janie lived and suffered with this idea
Her second husband, Jody Starks, although charming at first began to also treat her poorly a few years into their marriage
However, he managed to establish them in Eatonville and they became wealthy
Alright, the next thing you need to think about when you're planning to use humor is, think about and possibly plan some kind of comment, some kind of retort you can make if your element of humor totally crashes and burns.
Ok, you tell a joke, you tell a story, you tell a anecdote, you look in the audience and this is what you see.

&gt;&gt;SHARON BERRY: We want to talk now about institutional barriers.
Looking at your own organization, your own agency, to see what interferes with allowing trainees to bill.
The bigger picture is: Are you allowed within your state.
But let's say you are.
Many states are able to bill Medicaid for trainee services under the supervision of a licensed and credentialed provider.
Look at your agency and start conversations.
Key people will include your billing department, whatever it is called; revenue management, billing.
They may think that it is absolutely not possible, and you will want to start to give them evidence not only for how it is possible in the state, but how it is being done in other states, and what the difference will make to your program and to those who want the services you provide.
- It's Amanda from Derma Clinics and the topic for today is, what is an esthetician and why does everyone need one? So estheticians are skin therapists with a specific knowledge and understanding of advanced treatments and proper skincare recommendations
So why do you need one? Well the answer is simple
It's so easy to get lost in what seems like an endless pool of options when it comes to what skincare to use, and what treatments you should be having to fix your skin
So the first step in getting a little bit of clarity on this topic, is getting your skin analysed and having a proper consultation with an esthetician
That way you can sit down and have a proper discussion about what's bothering you about your skin, and where you'd like your skin to be
At Derma Clinics we look at the holistic health of your skin
We'll ask you questions to get a better idea of the history of what you've achieved with your skin, what you've used on your skin before, because all of these are really important factors for us to put together, when we are thinking about what the best recommendation is for you and for your skin

CASSIE MOGILNER: In general, consumers believe or perceive nonprofits to be more warm and not particularly competent.
On the other hand, they perceive for-profits to be competent but not particularly warm.
And what's interesting is to see how these perceptions play out in marketplace behaviors.
Across the studies we've found that it's perceptions of competence and not warmth that drives consumers' willingness to purchase.
Now that's a bummer certainly for nonprofits who are not necessarily less competent, but just as perceptions are driving that.
So then we were looking at are there ways that you can increase perceptions of competence amongst nonprofits.
And indeed there are.
So we found, for instance, if you receive an endorsement from The Wallstreet Journal and another credible source, that by boosting perceptions of competence for nonprofits, making them on par with their perceptions of warmth, that you actually elicit admiration.
And then that actually trumps just competence alone in terms of purchasing.
Alright, now that we have found some job openings, the next thing we're going to do we're going to respond to them.
And there are several ways in which you can actually respond to job openings.
Deloitte recently announced investment programs aims to expand client service and industry capabilities in select strategic markets.
I think what you’re seeing in the technology space today is if you look back 20 years, there tended to be dominant players in certain categories and the product was so differentiated and there was such a huge wide gap from the bottom of the category to the top of the category in terms of performance, speeds, screen sizes, memory, does it have a DVD player, reader or not?
And as in any category, as that consolidates and the gap closes from the top to the bottom, and the products become more similar as technology advances so far, marketing plays a much, much bigger role and other things that you bring to it.
And you want to set the tone that you have confidence in that person's ability to improve
Step seven, you want to document the performance counseling conversation
And that will vary from company to company, so whenever you have some kind of performance counseling conversation, it's best to check in with human resources first, find out what kind of documentation, if any, that they would like
And the reason that documentation is really important is it may become very important if you decide you want to maybe reassign that employee to a different role or you want to put them on a corrective action plan, or potentially even terminate employment
So again, that's likely to be company-specific, but again it's important that you just consult with your HR department

All right, another tip for helping your audience remember your speech, or certainly--certain parts of your speech, is repetition.
Some things in certain areas, certain fields, you're not supposed to keep repeating yourself, like when you write English papers.

But in speeches, it's a good thing, it's a positive thing to--not all the time, but several times--continually repeat something.
Especially something that you really want your audience to get.

BENZION: Social literacy is definitely one of my weak points.

BRETT KELLER: Consumers have become a lot more savvy in the types of tools that they're using, the way they're interacting with our website and our competitors' websites.

And what that does is that will allow a consumer to select any city that they want, and it will instantly plot all of the pricing for the hotels in that market on a map.

It didn't matter at all.
It just matter that inside of us, we're all trying to survive.
I have survived.
And I think that everyone who has survived in anything, they should be able to be the witness to these kinds of crimes, and not let more people die because they just are people.

According to a new analysis by economists at PwC, the US, China and Russia are again set to battle it out at the top of the Olympic Games medals table in London in August, although home advantage to Britain could play a part in how the Olympic medals are shared.
