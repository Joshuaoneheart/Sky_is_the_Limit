My name is Kathy Pabst Robshaw total telephone effectiveness.
You can make a conference call but it takes quite a bit of planning, well not a lot of planning its pretty easy to do.
What has to happen is before you can make that call you need to set up the phone number to make that call happen.
I mentioned a word in the last clip called monotone, and I want to talk about that briefly.
What you dont want is to be monotone.
What monotone is, is it means that you use only one pitch in your voice, so that everything sounds exactly the same.

Our fight against terrorism does not exist in a vacuum.
it comes with the assistance and agitation of states and regimes, Yesterday Iran announced that it will finance the families of the terrorists and murderers this shows that Iran, even after the nuclear agreement, is continuing to aid terrorism, including Palestinian terrorism, Hezbollah terrorism and its assistance to Hamas.
This is something that the nations of the world must confront and condemn and assist Israel – and other countries, of course – in repelling.
Second, the terrorism by those wielding knives, the Palestinian children, also does not exist in a vacuum.
It comes from the Palestinian education system, which is controlled by the Palestinian Authority.

Hey everyone, Aquaman here with Water Wisdom sponsored by WaterFilters.NET.
Todays product is from Pro Products, and it is Rust Out.
Rust Out is a water softener resin cleaner, specifically designed for well water, or water that is iron bearing.
If you have iron in your water you probably know it.
Its commonly the culprit behind those nasty iron stains in your toilet bowls, or in your tub or even in your laundry sometimes.
And if your softener is working properly and you have low levels of iron, your softener should be able to handle it.
But what happens is, the softener resin does not want to fully let go of all of the iron that it captures, and the resin becomes fouled.
Now, if you catch it early enough, you can fix that problem.

And this information had been brought to me, so I filed a case
And when the judge asked, So are you suggesting, Dr

 I said, Yes, we are
 And it led to a huge series of investigations and a new alertness
And whats basically happening is in countries like the US, the waste isnt thrown by every consumer everywhere

I think, and I do think, yes.

Hi there
Today were going to be reviewing Cheaper by the Dozen which is (umm) the original version
Theres a second movie out now but this is (uhh) Steve Martin in the first role
It tells the story of (umm) a family with twelve kids and his attempts to raise them
(umm) Includes Hillary Duff, Bonnie Hunt, Tom Welling and Piper Parabo
(umm) All names that should be familiar with kids and some adults and so this kind of makes the movie have wide appeal
I didnt really like the movie, I thought it was cheesy
I think Steve Martins done other better things
Ebert and Roper apparently said two thumbs up here on the cover but for me its probably two thumbs down
(umm) The humor seemed kind of contrived, kind of, you know, slapstick
(uhh) The dads getting hit by the kids or someones acting up sort of thing
Not all that funny and not all that original and I didnt think the acting was all that great either
But who knows? I (umm) am probably tougher on movies than a lot of people
This was pretty popular (umm) and its a good choice for like I said kids or families
(umm) So if youre looking for something its sort of lighthearted
(umm) Its only PG
Cheaper by the Dozen is a good place to look
But for me it only gets two stars out of five
Hi, Im doing my video opinion for Wolfs Rain Loss
This is the third DVD in the series and it contains (uhh) four episodes episodes eleven, twelve, thirteen and fourteen
Its very good
It continues the story
It keeps the (uhh) It keeps up the expectations that (uhh) came to be expected from the first two DVDs of the series
And (uhh) it introduces (umm) a couple new characters (umm) new situations and it really adds a lot to the story
You start learning more about the story
Its a really great (uhh) collection of the episodes on the third DVD
And if you enjoyed the previous two DVDs, you have to continue the story
Because (uhh) great story
Overall I would give it a five out of five stars because I have the previous two DVDs
And (uhh) Its just a great story so you have to continue the whole thing
But some of the things that happened in the third DVD Loss are the nobles really start eating up the world with the wolves and (uhh) some things happen with (uhh) Blue, youll know who she is from the third DVD, and (uhh) Quent
Theyre just (uhh) great DVDs
This is my review of a movie currently in theaters and that movie being Evan Almighty
I was a huge fan of the original film Bruce Almighty but I did think it was funny
Like Jim Carey, Morgan Freeman and I like Steve Carell too so I figured okay you know the sequel will be pretty good
Then I heard that it was gonna have like a, it was going way over budget, it was going to be two-hundred and fifty million
Then I was thinking I dont know how a comedy can really be two-hundred fifty million but you know, I guess with all this hype its worth seeing
And Im afraid it wasnt
(umm) All the money they seem to have spent on a giant arc and a bunch of live animals
There seems to be a ton of CG but there also seems to be a ton of real animals and Im not sure why they would have blown all that money when they could have just you know CGs it all, because the animals really werent that impressive
Its definitely geared towards kids, the story isnt as well done, as Bruce Almighty, seems to have targeted even a younger crowd
Like, I mean theres a lot of animal poop jokes in there that really didnt need to be there
Theres definitely better ways to go about humor than making you know really unfunny jokes, and theres a lot of moments like that
The story sucks, the characters were really wooden and plain and I liked some of the actors and actresses, so Im not sure what was going on there
It just seems like a really lousy effort by everybody and (uhh) I guess the box office is reflecting that
Unfortunately, it seems like itll be a good bomb
My children and I recently went to see the movie Surfs Up
(umm) I was very disappointed in it
It (uhh) was a commentary
It was a cartoon, of course, but it was kinda like a commentary
The penguin was being interviewed about things that had happened in the past
It did not hold the attention of my five year old
She was ready to leave when it was half over
(umm) We were at the drive in and it was the first movie and there was another movie coming, so there was no way we could leave
It used (uhh) words that I dont like my children to use
(umm) even though theyre not considered curse words, (umm) they were using the word (uhh) poop and crap (umm) things like that
People or (uhh) the penguins were passing gas
(umm) Just some untasteful things in the movie
And in my opinion, (umm) too, I think weve had enough (stutter) penguin movies made in the last year
(umm) Ive had my fill of it
So, I would highly recommend that you save your money
Hi, (umm) today the product that Im going to review is a DVD
This is how, (stutter) called (umm), South Park Bigger, Longer, and Uncut
(umm), I dont like this movie
I give it probably about a two, (umm) because of some of the language it contains
And, its the story about four friends, (umm), Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman, who sneak into an, X-rated or R-Rated movie, and it kind of warps their mind and then, for some reason their parents start a war against Canada or something
And its about the four boys trying to save (umm), some sort of Armageddon between us and Canada
Its an animated film, probably about an hour and a half, maybe two hours long
Its, (umm) as I said I dont like it, Id give it about a two
Its not appropriate for kids because theres a lot of cursing and things in it
But, if youre interested in owning this, you can find it on amazon dot com
Hi, this is my movie review of the movie (stutter) License to Wed starring Mandy Moore
(umm) This is a movie I though was going to be pretty funny because the trailer looked pretty funny and its got you know Robin Williams, which I personally like and thought you know hes gonna bring some entertainment to this movie
But I didnt really like this movie at all
It was boring
(stutter) The plot It was like it didnt have a plot
It was just they are trying to you know create all these things to make you laugh but I dont think it was funny at all
Even the robotic baby part was supposed to be funny, it didnt turn out to be funny in the film
It looked funny in the clip for the trailer but didnt seem funny at all
And (umm) you know Mandy Moores character is kind of like, you feel like her characters unrealistic because what type of girl would go that hard core to you know to get married in this church and it just seemed unrealistic and she gets all in a hissy fit and its just really really tiring and stressful movie
And it wasnt and I feel like the characters were underdeveloped
Theyre you dont like any of the characters
You dont connect with any of the characters
And It felt like the you know theres like just a little bit just way too typical of a boring film that tries really hard to be funny but its just not funny at all and its not its not (stutter) witty
It its (stutter) not even romantic you know in a way that, the way its written its like how can someone you know go that hard
Its just like at the end when youre done with the movie you dont even believe in the original premise of the movie
You dont believe that someone can actually you know believe in the priest and just wanted get married that badly in that church
And be you know believe everything in the priest, its just kind of like, the movies stressful
I dont know if its the acting or the way the characters are characterized
Its just really boring, bland film that even the plot it didnt really have anything going on for that
So (umm) For those who are interested, I definitely do not recommend this movie at all
My review is on Oceans Thirteen
I saw Oceans Eleven and Oceans Twelve and I really like those
All of the movies have George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and so you know, theyre nice to look at but Oceans Eleven and Twelve were good
Oceans Thirteen not good at all
I dont like it
I thought the other two were pretty exciting
And (uhh) not a lot of people liked Oceans Twelve but I still liked it
Oceans Thirteen, not exciting at all
They had some complications that were pretty small and were resolved pretty quickly without any drama or anything
It was just not exciting, at all
So if youre going to go see a movie, I would not recommend that
If you dont see it, youre not missing anything
I recently viewed the movie Click with Adam Sandler, and I was very disappointed
I expected more, Id seen the previews and I thought it looked like a pretty good story
(umm) Its PG-thirteen, but in this day and age, PG-thirteen its harder to tell what, what that really means, you know, well in this one theres lots of cussing, (umm) theres some bedroom scenes, even though they dont show any skin you obviously know what theyre doing
(umm) Theres (uhh) a dog that keeps (uhh) humping the stuffed animal, theres farting, I just I just (stutter) thought it was a rude movie
I loved the storyline
You know, I love the fact of what the story about, in fact in even made me cry in the end
But we couldve done without all the other garbage that they added to this movie
(umm) I dont know why they do that to movies, and my husband was very leery of it too, because he said Ive never seen an Adam Sandler movie thats actually been clean and (umm) and actually okay for children to watch
So Im gonna give this a two just because you know, it could (stutter) it had so much potential, and they just like, trashed it up in my opinion
I just watched (uhh) this movie, Happily NEver After
I was looking very forward to seeing it when I had remembered seeing the previews for it
I was very disappointed in it
I think it could have been (umm) so much more
I mean there was a few funny parts and I expected more from you know, considering all the stars it has in it
It has Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddy Prince Jr
, Andy Dick, George Carlin and Sigourney Weaver just to name a few
So I guess I just expected a few more, a a (stutter) better movie from these (umm) actors
This is rated PG so you can watch this with your kids
However, I started watching it with my kids and they got so bored they got up and left, went outside to play
So I was left watching this by myself, and I went ahead and watched it all the way through to the end so I could do this review and I was hoping that it would get better in the end
It didnt
(umm) Very Disappointing
Not much else I can say about it
(umm) Rent it if you must (umm) I would
Im glad I didnt pay money to go see this at the movies
I wouldve really been upset had I paid (uhh) you know, seven eight bucks a ticket for us to go see this
So anyway, if you dont have anything better to do, then you might watch this movie
Hi
My name is Jordan and today I will be reviewing the movie Ratatouille
(uhh) First of all lets say that I had an incredible build up to this movie
I saw the previews in theaters six months ago, (uhh) I looked at my friend and said look, were seeing this
(umm) I personally love Disney movies and I think that (umm) Disney Pixar, you know, the animations has just added a real, you know, incredible life-like (uhh) aspect to (umm) Disney movies which is especially true in Ratatouille which looks incredible
(uhh) I know that (umm) in Finding Nemo they had, in fact, (uhh) made the scenes look too real so they had to, you know, kind of fake it down and Im pretty sure they did the same thing in Ratatouille
(umm) I cook a lot {laughter} and so I can appreciate, you know, a lot of the (uhh) a lot of the food references that are made
(umm) I I (stutter) love the storyline, its so incredible, its like anyone can cook
(umm) Its a story about a rat who decides to become a chef in Paris and how he goes about doing that but, really I I (stutter) love this movie
I think I think (stutter) its incredible
(umm) I think that (uhh) a lot of the more recent videos from Disney such as The Emperors New Groove, (umm) Over the Hedge, and stuff like that, theyve had a lot of real high brow (umm) you know adult comedy but, I think Ratatouille does a very good job in (umm) sticking to its target audience which is kids and you know, hyping that to how Disney movies used to be, you know, with with kids jokes and not these kinds of inane sexual references so I would highly recommend Ratatouille
I think its a great movie that anyone should see
Okay
This is a review of John Lamaros Land of the Dead
Land of the Dead was (umm) and not as good as (uhh) the other Romero zombie movies
(umm) Yes it continued the motif of having zombies represent either (uhh) some sort of disenfranchised group
(umm) Which was you know, and important and interesting but if you like overall it really is, wasnt that new of a plot going on here
(umm) Felt pretty rehashed
As for the acting, the acting was pretty good (uhh) John Leguizamo was okay, better than I expected and (umm) Dennis Hopper was awesome as always
Hey there
Summer here and if youre looking for a fantastic DVD at a value price that everyone in your family can watch, well why not try Pay It Forward, with Haley Joel Osment, Helen Hunt, and Kevin Spacey? This movie takes you through the journey of a child who learns lifes lessons and it might just leave you crying in the end
Now I purchased this DVD for a little under ten dollars so its a great value to add to your DVD collection
But, word of caution
The movie is PG thirteen for some mature thematic elements including substance abuse and recovery, some sexual situations, language, and brief violence
But let me tell you for your older kids you can learn a lesson from this like none other
According to the movie its a simple story line
Haley Joel Osment has a teacher, Kevin Spacey, and a mom, Helen Hunt
The teacher gives him a lesson
Lets change the world
And he does
The process of the movie takes you through how he changed the world and how it comes from his small town to change peoples lives all the way across the country
This movie truly teaches you that one person can make a difference
Participating in the Diversity Inclusion Initiative has been incredibly beneficial to me in my career in a number of ways.
It gave me the opportunity to work on several projects at the University of North Texas, which has one of the largest music libraries in the world.
This helped give me the experience and qualifications I needed to make me competitive in the job market.
One of the projects that I was able to develop myself involved putting together a study of instructional practices in graduate institutions that offer music degrees from around the country.
This has provided valuable insight into curricular practice.
Another was the creation of a finding aid for the Anna Harriet Heyer Collection, which developed a practical skill while making the world aware of yet another important resource housed at the University of North Texas.
The Diversity Inclusion Initiative also fully supported a trip to the National Conference of the Music Library Association where I made many connections with librarians and spoke with representatives of several search committees.
Hi Im Caroline, today Id like to review The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
(uhh) I did not like this movie at all, I would not recommend it
I only watched half of it because I didnt like the rest of the movie
It is rated PG-thirteen
(uhh) It is a mind-blowing adventure
It has Sean Connery in it, {laugh} which is probably the biggest name in here
And little do you know that (uhh) the league extraordinary gentlemen has a woman in it and each of these (uhh) five people have different powers, and (uhh) theyre all a little bit special at what they do, and (uhh) youve got a vampire in there, youve got an invisible man
And they just go out and try to save save (stutter) {sigh} I guess these European countries and save the world from going into another world war
So (umm) (uhh) its a little interesting, it says it has eye popping effects and amazing action and it is definitely an action, probably for the guys out there, but really strange
Almost like a (umm) I dont know, really weird comic strip that youre gonna get
Comic, you know one of those weird ones that they put out
So (uhh) Sean Connery, the (stutter) League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
Movie review, I Know Who Killed Me
(uhh) Nah, not very good
One out of five at very most
(umm) But its a Lindsay Lohan movie, so (uhh) I dont know
I didnt like it
It was kind of (umm) more funny to me than it was scary
I kind of took the whole thing as a joke
But (uhh) its definitely in the vein of, like, I dont know, Id Id (stutter) say its pretty similar, in some aspects, to a movie like (umm) maybe even, maybe Saw
Its almost (umm), I dont know, its almost too similar, to the point of where you kind of know whats going to happen, kind of all all (stutter) those kind of movies kind of blend together
But, I mean, if youre going to watch a movie like that, go see Saw again or something, because this movie is really not good at all
Seriously
One out of five
So if you want to see it, you can do it
But I wouldnt
So I Know Who Killed Me, one out of five
Hi, Im Bruce and today (umm) Im reviewing the DVD (uhh) widescreen edition of Premonition, (uhh) starring Sandra Bullock and Julian McMahon, and heres a closer look at it
I dont have the box for it because I rented it (uhh) at (uhh) Red Box, one of their kiosks
And this is a psychological thriller
Its rated PG-thirteen, (uhh) and again starring Sandra Bullock and Julian McMahon and the (uhh) movie is about a woman whos forced to perpetually relive a terrible week in her life (uhh) where her husband is killed in a car crash
(uhh) {clears throat} And so we keep seeing a lot of same events over and over again
(uhh) What motivated me to (uhh) check out this movie was my wife, (uhh) really likes Sandra Bullock, so I got it primarily for her
Unfortunately, I cannot recommend it
It was (uhh) rather disappointing
(uhh) and (umm) It was very long
It was two hours and twenty minutes
(uhh) But it, and thats a long movie to me
But it felt (uhh) at least like three hours and the fact that they kept rewinding the story where she keeps reliving the same week over and over, (uhh) it felt extremely long (uhh) and (uhh) it just really went on a long time
Hi
Today Id like review Die Another Day, the James Bond movie starring Pierce Brosnan and Halle Berry
And this is one of the more recent James Bond movies but I found that its just really silly overall
(umm) I mean it has some entertaining action sequences, some cool gadgets and cars and stuff, but overall it just feels tired and old and not that engaging
(umm) The DVD however is quite good
Its, this is the two disc ultimate edition DVD, part of the James Bond ultimate edition set, and (umm) has several features on the two discs it comes in
(umm) Like audio commentary, (umm) lots of featurettes and documentaries, interactive things you can do
(uhh) Trailers, DVD-rom features, (umm) great audio and video quality so its got a lot of features and its generally a great DVD set but the movies not really that good so I (stutter) dont think Ill recommend it
Hey guys, my name is Emma and Im here to talk to you about a movie I saw recently, Spider Man Three
(umm) I gotta say Ive seen the other two Spider Man movies and I wasnt really that impressed, you know
Theyre pretty entertaining I guess and Im a fan of (uhh) Kirsten Dunst so I always like to watch movies that shes in but I didnt have high expectations for Spider Man Three because I didnt really like the first two, but it certainly did not exceed my incredibly low expectations
You know, it was probably worse than I thought it would be, actually
Granted I only paid two dollars to see it, (uhh) theres a really cheap movie theater where I live that I can go see movies that have come out (umm) recently for pretty cheap but two dollars didnt even really seem like a bargain considering that movie, you know? Just really cheesy (uhh) the graphics and stuff were just kind of annoying, like the CGI stuff
I dont know, Im not really into that, and the action in it was really not that exciting
(umm) The acting also horrible, you know, I realize its based on a comic book and thats kind of the style that theyre in, you know, kind of over the top, kind of cheesy, but I dont know
I feel like theres a lot of movies that have come out recently based on comic books that are way better than the Spider Man ones and its just kind of a disappointment
I think that they could have done a much better job on that movie
(umm) So in a scale from like one to five I think Id give it like a two, honestly
Hi, this is my review of Jurassic Park Three
(uhh) This is the third Jurassic Park, obviously, in the series and unlike the previous two it is not directed by Steven Spielberg
He does executive produce, but it is (uhh) directed by Joe Johnston
(umm) What I found most exciting about this movie when I first heard about that they were making a third is that it once again stars Sam Neill who was absent in the second movie
(umm) Unfortunately (uhh) when I ended up seeing it I was pretty disappointed all around
(uhh) The second movie I didnt think was nearly as good as the first, which is one of my all-time favorite movies, but (uhh) the second still had some good aspects to it and it was overall a pretty enjoyable movie
(uhh) The third one just feels completely (uhh) unneeded
It seems like weve seen all this before, (uhh) and seen it better
Theres really not a whole lot original original (stutter) concept left in it
(uhh) the storys just kind of a rehash of the previous movie and it overall just feels very forced
I dont think it was needed at all and I didnt really enjoy it
I actually found it pretty hard to sit through
So (uhh) I definitely will not recommend this movie
I would say you could skip it entirely even if you were a fan of the previous movies
(uhh) So unfortunately (uhh) a great series that really just lived on longer than I think it needed to
Hey guys, whats up? Right now Im going to review the movie Live Free or Die Hard featuring Bruce Willis
By far Live Free or Die Hard, or known as Die Hard Four, is probably my favorite as best movie in the Die Hard series
Bruce Willis is your old, your (umm) your (stutter) old typical cop but basically this time hes fighting internet (umm) terrorists
Basically the terrorists have hacked into the FBIs like security measures and theyre like taking over the world, or the United States at least
And you know saving as always the cop goes in, save the days
But basically this movie it was more xxx than your average action movie
The effects, like the shootout scenes, were amazing
They were done amazingly
When youre in the theater and youre watching them shootout each other you actually feel like youre there
The story it was actually done really well
It wasnt just your typical like you know terrorist then you know cop comes in and saves the day
There was like more plot to it than that
The action scenes were my favorite parts though
Its one of the best action blockbuster Ive seen this whole summer and I highly recommend you guys seeing it
Bruce Willis does his role perfectly, everything is done perfect
The casting was really good, the effects were awesome
I definitely recommend you guys watching that movie
You (uhh) you wont be disappointed
So how do I write terms and conditions for my business as a small business owner?
Well firstly what you need to do is list all of the things that are important for your products and services.
Get some examples from industry associations of the different terms and conditions that other people in your industry use, review them, look to see how your terms and conditions might fit into those, sit down and draft them, and then have somebody look at them like a solicitor or an industry representative to see that they meet all the compliances and state regulations.
Hi
This is Mama three for ExpoTV
Today I would like to review the Disney DVD, The Fox and the Hound
This film was originally released in nineteen eighty-one, it is rated G and its eighty-three minutes long
It follows the story of a hound dog named Copper and a fox cub named Todd and when theyre young, they are friends but one winter, Copper goes away with his (umm) owner and hes taught to be an hound dog that hunts and when he comes back, hes suppose to be hunting Todd and that causes conflict in their relationship
This is not one of my favorite movies, it doesnt seem to hold my kids attention either so no matter what the price of it is, its not one, that I would recommend buying
It does have some special features on here, there is the trailer, there a (stutter) trivia game, theres a read along, which actually my kids actually enjoy better than the movie
Hey there expotv, Summer here
Today were reviewing the DVD Freedomland
Now Freedomland has Samuel L Jackson and Julianne Moore
It is rated R for some language and some violent content and it runs about two hours long
Now I want to tell you this from the beginning
I do not like this movie
I dont see any sense in Freedomland ever being made
I understand that the movie was based on the bestselling novel, I understand that it was acted well, I understand that Julianne Moore totally was out of character by playing the person she played in this movie, but I didnt see the premise behind the movie
Now (stutter) the premise of course is is (stutter) basically a a (stutter) white woman living in the not so white section of the city, has her car stolen and her son is in the backseat supposedly and there is a frenzy
The entire town is trying to find her son
Theyre looking and looking and looking, and shes got a history of using drugs, and she has a history of being a liar and not not (stutter) acting appropriately and then not being (stutter) you know a person with (uhh) everything there, all her marbles together in a row
And (uhh) that this (stutter) to me was very, very similar to some news event that had actually occurred
And then thats when it fell off for me
When Im watching a movie of something you know with with (stutter) actors of this caliber I expect to watch something thats new and unique and I didnt find that with this movie
So for me Freedomland was a total waste of time
It was a total waste of money
I hated the movie
I dont think Samuel L Jackson should have been in it and I think that Julianna Moore lowered herself to play the person in this movie
I hated the events that unfolded and I hated the ending
Hi, ExpoTV
Today Im reviewing (umm) Zoom Academy for Superheroes
Its actually based on a novel (umm)
I think its called Zooms Academy for (stutter) Supergifted
(umm) And I have to say that I was not overly impressed with this movie
(umm) It seemed to be a little bit boring (umm) getting through it
(umm) Theres a few decent stars in there where, I guess, maybe thats where my disappointment came from
I thought, Oh, this is going to be funny and good
Tim Allen, Courteney Cox, and an old classic, Chevy Chase, in there
So (umm) the story is about (uhh) Tim Allens character (umm) now has lost all his powers
He hasnt done any superhero work in a long time
So hes lost his powers
But something, you know, theres a villain and hes needed to help save the day
So he goes in and trains all these (umm) kids who have superpowers, and hes training them how to defeat, you know, the villains
So thats what the storyline is about
But I didnt find it too exciting
(umm) I dont know
{movie} Hey whats up Expo videos, Im here to talk about Napoleon Dynamite
{movie} Everybody, Im mute it just to talk but everybody knows Napoleon Dynamite
Its like the new movie
Its like the the new teenage movie to watch
Its like a big hit
(uhh) Napoleon Dynamite is definitely a classic comedy of our age I guess you could say
(umm) This is something that youll be showing your kids just cause you know, (umm) maybe Sixteen Candles or like (umm) other movies like that (uhh) would be like a movie that your parents showed you or something
But this is definitely something youre gonna show your kids cause its hilarious, and its hilarious in a different way and a lot of people dont (uhh) appreciate it as much as xxx it is because they just kinda think its funny but I think this is creatively done because Im into like a weird humor, I guess you could say, and theres like (umm) like hidden humor in here just that (uhh) with editing and continuity and (uhh) just the way things are produced that makes it humorous in that aspect as opposed to just (uhh) the way he is
And its (stutters) intelligently made I think
One of the best comedies out there of our age as opposed to like, those other comedies that are actually really stupid with just bad bad (stutter) jokes and what not
(uhh) Definitely something to check into
You can tell this is made by (uhh) film students
(uhh) But its really good, I really enjoy it
In this lesson, youve learned a lot of concepts that well be applying in this course.
Concepts about structuring data into tables, extracting data that we want, counting rows with aggregations and linking tables together using primary keys and joins.

1) Be ready early - We’ve heard from employers who call job seekers during their scheduled time, only to be met with a voice mail

Maybe your clock is a few minutes fast, maybe they were running a little behind
Whatever the case may be, treat this as you would for an in-person interview – be ready around 10 minutes early
This will ensure you won’t miss their call and will also give you some time before the interview starts to go over any final points you want to remember
[BROLL] Interviewee is nicely dressed sitting at a table with a with pen, notepad, glass of water and phone
The Interviewee is reviewing his/her notes
2) Clean up - I don’t know about you, but I am at my best when I’m showered, dressed and organized
Weve created a simple spreadsheet Just like the one youre currently using but packed with all the great features you get in Modern CRM systems You can set reminders and appointments and sync them with your Google calendar
I personally love the to-do list with my next tasks, and theres a lot more! The pricing is also great
It was very important for us to make it affordable for small businesses, so while pricing starts at $29 per user Its easy to reduce the price to five dollars by sharing it with friends
One of the interesting dilemmas when you look at research and advertising is that if you ask the psychologist and my behavioral colleagues does advertising work?
They study it in the lab.

Good morning.
This is my video review of The (uhh) Simpsons Movie
If you havent seen this movie by now I dont really think you should
Its been out in theaters quite awhile
Im pretty sure theyll be taking it out soon and in my opinion, this is pretty much just a big let down
There (stutter) wasnt that many funny parts in the movie and the only funny parts that there actually were I had already seen cause they were in the commercials
So if you own a TV and you saw the commercials, I wouldnt recommend seeing the movie, and even if you didnt see the commercials, I wouldnt really recommend the movie
I mean, I love the Simpsons and pretty much theyre always funny
Some people dont like the current seasons, but I still think that theyre pretty funny, and I was really let down by the movie
So I mean the whole plot was kind of stupid
Theyre trying to save Springfield
(stutter) I guess I didnt like the plot so once the plot got ruined, I really didnt care
The movie seemed to kinda drag on for me and it wasnt even that long
It was definitely a comedy and I guess if youre a true Simpsons fan youre gonna wanna see the movie
But youre probably just gonna end up wasting about six bucks
So if youre thinking about seeing it, I wouldnt recommend it
Maybe rent it, thats probably gonna be cheaper and if you rent it, I wouldnt really expect too much cause really you can see a lot funnier stuff in the show, and the shows are free
Hi, this is Brian
Id like to talk to you about a movie
Its called All of Me
Its actually kind of a short movie
Its only like ninety-one minutes long
(umm) This is the Gold Reel Collection
(umm), Its kind of a slow movie
It does star Lily Tomlin, and Steve Martin
(umm) Its interesting that Steve Martin is an an (stutter) attorney or lawyer, but he wants to be a magician, and, (umm) Lily Tomlin, (umm) is a spinster and I dont want to give away too much of the plot but she ends up being inside of (umm) her spirit becomes inside of (umm) Steve Martin and thats where a lot of the interesting things in the movie come in
(umm) It wasnt one of my favorite movies, but (umm) Id probably give it a two but, two out of five stars but (umm), if you havent seen the movie maybe you want to rent it before you you (stutter) purchase it but you can probably get it for ten dollars because its been out for a little bit
Again, this is All of Me
Hello Expo Tv
(uhh) Im here today to review the movie Michael Clayton currently in theaters
(umm) If youre like most people including myself, you probably will not enjoy this movie because I most definitely did not
(uhh) most people would call it a law thriller
(uhh) Kind of like, John Grisham kind of books but Maybe more along the lines of like a two thousand page John Grisham book
(uhh) Its just, its far too long
If you even look at the other Expo TV reviews about this movie, even the people that like the movie all seem to agree, the movies way too long
(uhh) The movie stars John Grisham, I mean {laughter} the movie stars George Clooney as Michael Clayton and (uhh) he actually, he does a pretty decent job and (uhh) anyways, Michael Clayton is (uhh) the fixer of the law firm, (uhh) takes care of all the messy messy (stutter) corporate cases
And also kind of complicating this is the fact that his personal life sort of unraveling with gambling and family problems and all sorts of things and basically he gets to the point where he just gets completely sick of fixing everyones mistakes and it just kinda compounds and (uhh) I dont wanna ruin it for you, but
Hopefully youre not gonna see it anyway because it sucks
So (uhh) I give the movie two out of five stars
George Clooney does alright
And I dont know, it makes you think a little bit but most of the time youre just thinking I wish I didnt watch this movie
So save your money and go see something else
Until next time
Hello my name is Sarah and I will be doing my video opinion on the movie Shall We Dance? (uhh) starring Jennifer Lopez, Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon
(umm) You know I really didnt enjoy this movie at all (uhh) it was, kinda boring for me, (umm) it kinda felt as if there were parts in there they just put in there to kinda pass the time on
(umm) Basically the movie is about (umm) Richard Geres character and him being a workaholic
(umm) Hes looking for some some (stutter) extra sizzle to add into his life and he meets up with a dance instructor who is played by Jennifer Lopez and basically she convinces him to sign up for some ballroom lessons
He gets into it, he enjoys it a lot but hes still keeping a secret from his family so he is trying to cope with having this this (stutter) you know, exciting moment added to his life and trying to keep it from his family so hes trying to figure out how to balance everything and you know I mean the dance scenes in here I felt were fantastic I thought Jennifer Lopez did a fantastic job and the girl really can dance (umm) as as (stutter) far as that goes, thats pretty much it
I think the movie was horrible, it was kinda boring but (uhh) if you like to see some dancing, then hey pick it up if not
Hi, my name is Mike, and this is my review for Mr
Magoriums Wonder Emporium and (uhh) this was a film that we took our two year old to (uhh) just a couple days ago
(umm) Its probably one of the worst films (uhh) Ive seen probably in the last five or six years
(umm) The main reason why was there wasnt much of a plot but it was pretty boring
(uhh) Not, not (stutter) really a lot of interesting things (uhh) seemed to occur during the (uhh) during the show
(umm) One of the things that was (uhh) kind of interesting is it seems to be a cross between Willy Wonka and (uhh) and some other Christmas style movies (uhh) in which theyre just hoping to kind of show you some (uhh) interesting, colorful scenery (uhh) and have a toy store in which you walk by things and things pop out and weird stuff happens
But (uhh) that just after maybe a minute or two of that and it becomes, you become used to it, youre just really not interested in seeing any more of that
(uhh) Dustin Hoffman (uhh) is kind of bizarre (uhh) cast as this (uhh) particular person and Natalie Portman seems to just be sleepwalking through the role
(uhh) (stutter) Everybody involved in this movie (uhh) seems to just be cashing a paycheck
Its a horrible, terrible film and so I I (stutter) cant (uhh) recommend it whatsoever
So definitely pass on Mr
Magoriums Wonder Emporium
(uhh) Save your money and rent (uhh) the classic Willy Wonka and youll enjoy (uhh) the experience a whole lot better
And my name is Mike, thats been my movie review
Hi, my name is Anaj, and today Im reviewing the movie Saawariya which is currently running in theaters (uhh) nationwide
Now Saawariya is an Indian movie, its actually a Bollywood production and the (uhh) nowadays (uhh) some Indian movies do show up in the US theaters
(umm) Now about Saawariya
I do not have good words for this movie
(uhh) I think its like one of the worst movies Ive ever seen
(uhh) Well the the (stutter) thing is that it stars this new guy whos son of the old heroes so its kind of his (stutter) launch in, you know, home production
So its (uhh) the story goes like, you know, theres (uhh) this new singer dancer at a bar which is in the call girl area or the red light area kind of thing and he falls in love with this girl, but this girl is in love with some other person so, you know, the story is whether hell actually get the girl or not and, you know, how he pursues that
(umm) The only good thing about this movie are the songs and the dances
So if youre a fan of Indian songs and the dances that go along with it you may want to watch this movie but otherwise Ill just rate this movie one out of five
(uhh) Was bad, bad (stutter) part of New York actually, you know, going to the movies
I just lost three hours of my time for nothing
Hello, my name is Sara and I will be doing my video opinion on the classic Elf, (umm) starring the wonderful comedian Will Ferrell
(uhh) This movies basically about a child who was found in a convent and snuck into Santa Clauss bag, was taken back to the North Pole and had (uhh) been raised by elves
So basically he lived his whole life you know (umm) thinking he was an elf
Of course he was the tallest kid
Like he couldnt fit in the seats, you know he always outgrew all the other elves so he always had wondered you know, why was he so different
So he finds out that he (umm) has a dad somewhere else (uhh) and he travels to New York City
(umm) This movie is is (stutter) definitely hilarious
(umm) It goes through the you know, different things that he had experienced being in New York
(umm) Experiencing you know, a whole new life change
(umm) Which I thought was you know, really cool
Hes going through all these different things
He decides to work at a toy store
(umm) This is just really cool and this, what I like about this DVD is that it gives you an option
It gives you two discs, (umm) which one is for widescreen and one is for full screen
Which is great I think (umm) you know, someone who really doesnt, I dont really like widescreen so Im great that it gives me an option
So again I really think you should pick it up
interested in this opportunity and passionate about the industry that he wants to be able to join
Therefore he can add value and be a great fit for this organization
Now you want to make sure that you practice practice practice
This is your first impression to the interviewer, so you dont want to lose their attention in order to really knock it out of the park, you want to plan and rehearse
It is almost guaranteed that youre going to get a question similar to this one so you want to make sure that youre selling what the interviewer is buying
Think about what theyll be interested in by really understanding the job description and the traits that theyre looking for in the job description
Hi, my name is Anaj and today Im reviewing the movie Lions for Lambs which is currently playing in theaters nationwide
Now Lions for Lambs has a great star cast
It stars Robert Redford, Tom Cruise, Meryl (stutter) Streep, and you know thats about it, thats the only good thing about the movie, theres nothing else that is good about this movie and Ill tell you why
So (stutter) so Tom cruise is a senator and (uhh) Meryl Streep is a (uhh) reporter from one of the newspapers or magazine or TV that Im not very sure, but shes, shes (stutter) a reporter
So one of the scenes is going on in Tom Cruises office where the reporter and Tom Cruise are talking to each other
The other scene is back in Afghanistan and theres a platoon of, you know, the army, the marines who are kind of fighting, and the third is actually a philosophy professor whos talking to his student in his office
And (stutter) all the three of the, you know, all the three scenes are kind of related to each other because theyre talking about why did the US go to war with Afghanistan and Iraq and what was the reason and what can be done now? And (stutter) you know whatever they talk about its, they try to make a (stutter) drama out of it, a dramatic movie out of it, but really doesnt make sense, you know
(stutter) Everyone that Ive talked to, I saw the movie I hated it
Everyone I talks to said that it did not make any sense
You know with all these star casts, these (stutter) star collectors in there, you know, that you go watch Tom Cruise in theaters (uhh) you know he hasnt been in theaters for a while now
And you see go watch his new movie and its its (stutter), you know, crap
Its its (stutter) not at all good, Im sorry for the words but thats what the movie is
And (uhh) I rate this movie one out of five
If I had a chance of putting it zero, so you know, its D
If I get a chance of F Ill give a F, Ill give it a zero
But anyways Ill give it a one
Do not go in theaters to watch this movie, this (uhh) movies no good
I mean only if you have an additional two hours in your life that you have nothing to do go watch that movie
Hey guys, today weve got Men In Black Two which is the sequel to the first Men In Black based on the (uhh) I believe it was a Dark Horse comic starring Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones
And in the back were playing just the opening scene when when (stutter) Will Smith is riding this giant worm creature through the tunnels so he can rescue the innocent citizens of New York
And (uhh) this movie I thought was a very inferior sequel, it was good it had some good moments, some good elements to it
(uhh) Some of the comedy was good there was still a decent chemistry between (uhh) Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones
(uhh) Rosario Dawson shows up for her first blockbuster appearance (umm) later on she went to star in a lot of movies by Edward Burns and in Sin City and some other movies, Alexander
And (umm) well overall the movie just wasnt as good, the props were just as interesting the design was just as (uhh) good
The effects were (stutter) not quite as good I thought they could have been a bit better given the fact that it was a few years later and that (uhh) you know ILM standards are continually evolving
It just wasnt as funny, wasnt as entertaining
I have to give it two stars out of five
Hi guys it is coach Jim again
I talk to you about another movie I recently watched with my son
It was (uhh) Fred Claus
Now Fred Claus is a show
Well if youve seen the previews youve seen the best parts of the movie
(umm) It wasnt my favorite, I actually thought the plot stunk
The acting was horrible
(umm) Its not one of my favorites that Ive Ive (stutter) watched, it was actually one of the worst ones Ive seen in a long time
(umm) Just, it (stutter) oh my gosh its so (stutter) my eleven year old son did, about halfway through he was ready to go home
Okay, oh me, weve seen this plot millions and millions of times, you know blah blah blah, everybody knows you can pretty much tell what the whole movies about just from the commercials
(umm) Not my favorite show and I do not recommend it for anybody it was just retarded
(umm) It has, it it (stutter) makes no sense it kind of shift around a little bit
Hi, today I am reviewing the DVD movie, Scary Movie
(umm) It says on the box, its hilarious and outrageous
I really didnt find it that funny
I think its geared more toward (umm) the younger teenage, preteen audience even though its definitely not appropriate for them
This movie takes (umm) horror movies and makes spoofs on them so its actually a comedy movie
As you can see, its playing here in the background (umm) it features mostly high school kids so (umm) hence the audience is geared towards
I (umm) like I said definitely do not waste your eighty-eight minutes (umm) xxx (umm) watching this
(umm) There are much better movies out there
If youre looking for comedy, then {laughter} rent or buy a comedy and if youre looking for something thats going to scare you, then I would definitely just rent or buy a horror movie because this movie just didnt do it for me
The acting is bad
(umm) The writing is bad and (umm) it just looks like a low budget film to me
Hi Expo TV
This is Rachel
Today Im going to be reviewing the movie Crossroads
If you think Britney Spears is bad now you havent seen this movie
Its awful
Its about three girls in high school
(umm) theyre getting ready to graduate and go their separate ways
They were best friends when they were younger and now theyve gone their separate ways and theyve come back together and theyre going on a road trip
(umm) Awful awful acting
Obviously starring Britney Spears, (umm) Taryn Manning and Zoe Saldana
Also has Dan Akroyd and Kim Catrell in it
(umm) It does have a lot of special features, if you like Britney Spears its got some music videos
(umm) Two of em, for Overprotective and Im Not A Girl, Im Not Yet A Woman
(umm) Seven deleted scenes, a sing along with Britney, a karaoke version of some of her songs
(umm) A Crossroads through photo gallery
Lots of special features but an awful movie
Hi
Today on ExpoTv Im going to be reviewing (umm) a new movie that is a French movie and its called Smiley Face
And Smiley face is (umm) kind of the same (uhh) genre of movies as (umm) you know the Cheech and Chong movies, and (uhh) Half Baked, Grandmas Boy, that kind of like stoner movie
And but this one is just not even really that funny and really even that good at all
(umm) Basically (uhh) the plot of the movie is this (umm) (uhh) pothead named Jane eats (umm) these these (stutter) (umm) (uhh) treats that are, that have THC in them and she doesnt know that she does it and it just follows her day and her hilarious, supposed to be hilarious, misadventures and mishaps
But (umm) its not funny (umm) its really really just a bad movie and (uhh) if you want to see a good stoner movie see Half Baked, its really funny
Or Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle
Dont see this one, just skip it
Its not worth your money, and (umm) just dont go to see it
Whats up, Expo? This is Seth again
Im going to be reviewing the DVD three thousand Miles to Graceland
This stars Kurt Russell and (umm) (uhh) Kevin Costner
And what it is about (umm) two guys that are teamed up to (umm) go make a daring (umm) robbery of a casino in Las Vegas
And the twist is that its during an Elvis (umm) (uhh) conference
And everybody is dressed up as Elvis
And so (umm) thats exactly what they do
Thats what (umm) the whole Graceland part is about
Its (uhh) so they do, they attempt this daring robbery and then theres some twists and theres some turns
(umm) It is rated R for some strong violence (uhh) during the robbery
Im going to show you a clip here


974} Its an okay movie
Id probably only give it a two out of five stars
(umm) Its not the greatest movie
But two out of five stars
(umm) You might enjoy it one time
(umm) If youre an Elvis fan, you like seeing a bunch of guys dressed up as Elvis, you might like it even more than I do
Hey this is Dan with a review of The Simpsons the Movie
(umm) I have been an avid fan of The Simpsons most of my life, and (uhh) was quite disappointed that the movie wasnt anything more spectacular than in an overblown episode per se
(umm) The Simpsons the Movie basically (umm) (uhh) it serves on the premise of (umm) basically the entire town (umm) being at the verge of a toxic waste dump and ready to be quarantined
(umm) When things happen that makes it such, (umm) the national government steps in and tries to seal it off in a bubble of sorts
(umm) The premise isnt anything too far fetched out of a wacky Simpsons episode, and the postmodern (uhh) references within it to (uhh) movies like Titanic and (umm) other references or nothing more than something you might expect from a halloween special to The Shining or something like that
So there was nothing too novel about it, I didnt find it particularly funny, particularly interesting and definitely not worth a ticket price (umm) let alone probably wanting to purchase this movie unless you get it at a really good deal
(uhh) It is a overblown episode, would not highly recommend it out of five, (uhh) out of four stars I would probably give this two
(uhh) Out of five its definitely two
But The Simpsons The Movie not worthwhile in my book
It has cooler animation stressing more three D at the perspectives but nothing too revolutionary, so with that, The Simpsons the Movie, (umm) not something Id really keep in my collection unless you can get it for a pretty good deal despite the donuts
Hi
I am Chris and this is a review of the DVD, The Last Castle starring Robert Redford and James Gandolfini
(umm) In this movie, Robert Redford plays a (umm) military general sent to (umm) prison for a crime, sort of a technicality of a crime (umm) but he is sent to a military prison and the warden of the prison is James Gandolfini, best known for his role in the sopranos
And once there, Robert Redford finds that the prison is hopelessly corrupt and some of the inmates are being murdered and (uhh) James Gandolfinis character, the warden, (uhh) is running the prison (uhh) like a despot and (uhh) theres just a whole bunch of bad things going on inside the prison that shouldnt be happening
(uhh) Robert Redford decides to do something about it and takes command and runs the military prison as sort of a military camp
(umm) This movie starts out okay but quickly devolves, (umm) it doesnt end up being very good
I am not exactly sure (uhh) what Robert Redford is doing in this movie
(umm) I feel maybe he lost a bet (umm) towards the end of this movie, it just becomes (uhh) silly
The ending was a little bit surprising but by then I I (stutter) really didnt care anymore
(umm) This movie, it doesnt turn out to be as good as it starts out
Its a fairly (uhh) promising premise at the beginning but the (uhh) execution was just poor and it cant make up its mind if its (uhh) a prison story or a action movie or (uhh) exactly or military inquest (uhh) type of a conspiracy movie
It just cant make up its mind what it is and falls apart in every level and (umm) by the end, youre just not interested anymore
(uhh) As far as the DVD itself goes, special features (umm) on this includes pretty standard theatrical trailer, production notes, deleted scenes, commentary and (uhh) a little HBO movie called (uhh) Inside The Castle Walls about military prisons and things like that
Really (umm) its not, its not worth your time
(umm) Maybe if its on TV, you might watch it then, but really, I wouldnt bother with The Last Castle on DVD
Hi here with me today I have the DVD called The Ghost and the Darkness
It has Michael Douglas and Val Kilmer in it
(umm) I dont think is one of the best movies (uhh) ever its about (umm) is about (uhh) two guys who go to Africa because theyve been called upon because (uhh) a village over there in East Africa, this is set in 1996, has a problem because theres two man-eating lion, lions (stutter) who are (uhh) killing a lot of the people there
So these people are commissioned to hunt the animals
So they have a lot of problems (umm) during that time and they set up traps which the lions (umm) actually (uhh) outsmart them with, so its actually kind of interesting
But its a very drawn out long movie, (umm) not really interesting the endings pretty lame and kind of flops in the end
(umm) Which is why I guess this movie this movie (stutter) didnt really (uhh) hit big or anything
But (uhh) (uhh) this is (uhh) I wouldnt, its not really a action movie Id classify more as like a, its like a story
(umm) And then you dont feel sympathetic for anybody in this movie
(uhh) Not the lions, not the people, not the hunters or the (umm) village people so theres nobody really to side with in here
(umm) Its, it (stutter), I wouldnt suggest this, its (uhh) not a, not a very great movie, not all very well put together
This is Fantastic Four, the first one
Its playing here in the screen
What can I say about this? It stars Jessica Alba and though she may be pretty, shes not the best actress
The movie is just really not that great
(uhh) The acting in it is mediocre
The special effects in it is the same and so is the script and story
All of its mediocre
The direction was was (stutter) horrible
I was completely unsatisfied by this movie
(umm) Theres not much else to say besides that
But the story was so bad that I actually considered leaving halfway through the movie
So, dont go out there and get this movie please, because its really not worth it
If you wanna see a good superhero, if you wanna see a good superhero movie, go see any of the Spider-Mans, go see any of the go see Batman Begins, thats a good one, or go see any of the X-Men
Those are all great movies
This movie just jumped on the superhero bandwagon and just did not do a good job at retelling the true story of the Fantastic Four group
It just didnt do it any honor
I would be ashamed to have made this film if I was a director
So I dont suggest you go out there to watch it and waste your money on this DVD
This is the Nicholas Cage film Windtalkers directed by John Woo
Heres a clip, clip playing on the television screen
(umm), Im going to have to say do not get this movie
Do not go out there and watch it
Its just no good
Usually Im a big Nicholas Cage fan but this time he completely missed his mark
But I feel like it was John Woo to blame
John Woo does martial arts
He does not do war films
And martial arts really like to emphasize dramatic scenes every single second
You know what I mean, like throwing a, throwing a (stutter) suitcase across the grounds very dramatic
Running across the room is very dramatic when everyone is shooting at you
But, war movies are supposed to be as a whole dramatic
But he tries to make every single little tidbit of it very dramatic and very it becomes very awkward
Nicholas Cage does his best, but he cant just pull it off
(umm) Theres a scene where they mix actual real life cannon firing video with filmed video, and its just very awkward to watch
I didnt enjoy it at all
The musical score was no good
A lot of the movie is just more awkward than it is entertaining
So I dont suggest going out there and finding Windtalkers
Save yourself the money, get yourself another Nicholas Cage movie
I dont know, like Face-Off
Thats a good John Woo, Nicholas Cage movie
Hi Expo TV, this is Melissa and you can check out my reviews at PM three two one to see (uhh), what Ive been reviewing lately
Im reviewing for you today, The Matrix, featuring Keanu Reeves and Lawrence Fish, Fishburn (stutter)
Basically, this movie, changed (umm), the way movies are made now
(uhh), they just came out with these innovative new ways to film that just changed the whole film industry, and a lot of movies have started to film like the way they did The Matrix
(umm) Theres some good special features on this (uhh), DVD
You have behind-the-scenes documentaries, cast and crew commentary, music only audio track, follow the white rabbit and take the red pills for more mysteries, mind bending extras
(umm) We also have interactive menus, filmographies, (uhh) scene access, English subtitles, and more
(umm) basically this is what it says on the back here and (uhh), I was trying to think of a way to describe this movie because its just so complex, and the way they put it on the back just (umm), its the right way to say it
(umm), Our perception is our day in and day out world is real
And the reality is the world is a hoax and elaborate (stutter) decept, (uhh) deception spun by an all power, spun by all powerful machines of artificial intelligence that control us
(umm) This, movie really makes you think, what if there is more to what our world really is, and its just a fabulous movie if you havent seen it you definitely have to watch it
I give it a five out of five, and its something you need to check out
Hello, Im reviewing the movie The Missing starring Tommy Lee Jones and Cate Blanchett
(uhh) This is another Ron Howard film
(umm) Its supposes, supposed (stutter) to be a suspense movie
(umm) Essentially what happens is (uhh) Cate Blanchett (uhh) is living on the prairie and (uhh) someone or something comes in and captures her daughter
Kidnaps one of the two girls and takes off with her and Tommy Lee Jones is actually Cate Blanchetts father
He shows up (uhh) to help find the girl
Hes an indian tracker (umm) so he has the ability (uhh) to help find the girl
(umm) I gotta say I honestly didnt get this one
I didnt think Tommy Lee Jones (uhh) pulled off this role at all
(uhh) Thought Cate Blanchett did a great, did a good job
(uhh) But nothing really great
(uhh) Didnt get it
Didnt understand it
As far as it being a Ron Howard film I was actually fairly disappointed
(uhh) This particular version actually comes with the first disc which has the movie on it and then you have the second disc that has a whole lot of (uhh) bonus features
Actually (umm) three alternate endings
Maybe if they wouldve picked another one it wouldve been been better
(uhh) Eleven deleted scenes and eleven behind the scenes featurettes (umm) and a lot of other stuff as well
So I would not recommend this one, (uhh) even with all the bonus footage
Hi this is Dan with my review of The Namesake available on DVD
This movie tracks the story of two generations of Indian Americans that (uhh) basically believe their homeland to come to America
(umm) The father and mother have two (umm) children a son and a daughter here in America and they try to identify basically who they are and how they fit in in this culture
The (uhh) generation divide and also with cultural issues are illustrated in this movie
And (umm) unfortunately this serious theme drags on for quite a long time
And (uhh) unless you have great interest in this subject, I frankly lost a bit of interest rather quickly so (uhh) it wasnt the best movie to me
In my opinion I, I (stutter) only give it two out of five stars
The Namesake does tackle a serious topic and (umm) it does a good job portraying life although kind of depressingly as our main character (umm) struggles in life to find out who he is and how he fits in
The Namesake (umm) is rated PG-thirteen and (umm) generally pretty benign of a movie (uhh) so available on DVD
(uhh) I again recommend it with two of five stars
Hi, this is Jack and Im reviewing the new movie out (umm) The Good Shepherd, (umm) starring Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, William Hurt, Alec Baldwin, Robert De Niro, so I mean, obviously you can tell its got an all-star cast
But unfortunately, I dont think an all-star cast really makes up or really makes the film
(umm) This is for, this is (stutter) Robert De Niros return to directing for since the last thirteen years
I really really wish he could have done a better job
(umm) I mean the story involved with the CIA part of it, with Matt Damon you know in the CIA, its its (stutter) interesting, but sometimes it seems kind of stretched out
And there are parts of it that are boring, but the really bad part about the movie is all these things all these parts having to do with his family
I mean I understand thats kind of an important part of a movie but it made up about a third of the movie and I really wanted to sleep through all of it
(stutter) The movie is almost three hours long
So I mean its a really really long movie
I was bored through most of it
I mean I was really really disappointed
With an all-star cast like this, apparently good director, you know and excellent story, youd think theyd be able to do it but I dont think it was worth it
Hi, Im here to review In the Name of the King
Its a film currently in theaters
(uhh) Its based on the xxx series of video games
This one was horrible
Im giving it a one out of five
(uhh) It takes place in medieval times and its about an ongoing war between (umm) I dont even know
{laughter} This movie had horrible plot, horrible acting, horrible dialogue, horrible special effects, horrible action
There was no saving grace for this film
It starred Jason Statham so I thought it would be good cause he tends to be in pretty good movies but no, this was a let down
(umm) Its directed by Uwe Boll who is known for making pretty bad movies however this film see (uhh) most of his films are bad enough that theyre funny, you can laugh at them
This one doesnt even offer that its just boring more than anything
(uhh) It tries to be Lord of the Rings
It has a many of orge like creatures, a wizard, a medieval time setting
Basically stole everything out of Lord of the Rings but made a million times worse
(umhh) Its just everyone stay away from this film
It was a horrible movie
(umm) So yea thats In the Name of the King in a nutshell
Hi, Im Chris, and this is a review of the DVD of the movie Constantine starring Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weiss
(umm) In this movie Keanu Reeves plays a sort of (umm) exorcist kind of a character where he performs exorcisms and he is (uhh) in touch with the demon world
(umm) His character is John Constantine, hence the title, and this is based on a series of (uhh) graphic novels and he he (stutter) can see demons and he can see (umm) otherworld spirits and he basically fights them
He has (uhh) some fairly strange weapons that he uses this, that he uses to do this
(umm) Holy water and a shotgun made out of a crucifix
Its a fairly strange movie
(umm) I know its based on a graphic novel and those movies can tend to (uhh) run on the strange side
(uhh) This movies a little stranger than most, it really was very odd
(umm) If youre into this kind of stuff I guess it was okay
Theres a big sort of (uhh) conspiracy to unleash a bunch of demons from hell and (umm) Keanu Reeves is trying to stop this and (umm) Rachel Weiss plays a cop who sort of reluctantly agrees to help him, basically reluctantly because she doesnt really believe him and he has an assistant who (uhh) the assistant has some pretty funny parts
Hes not bad but (umm), I dont know
This movie just didnt do it for me
(umm) I really didnt enjoy it
I I (stutter) slogged my way through it but it it (stutter) really wasnt that interesting
(umm) I really wouldnt recommend this, Ive seen this sort of (uhh) theme done better
(umm) As far as the DVD goes there are eighteen minutes of additional footage which usually (umm) these scenes are cut out of the movie for a pretty good reason
They really dont add anything to the movie
Theres an alternate ending which isnt any better or any worse than the original ending, then theres you know theatrical content, (uhh) theatrical trailer and different languages and stuff like that
(umm) Maybe rent this but I definitely wouldnt buy it
So thats the DVD of the movie Constantine starring Keanu Reeves
Hi expo
This is my review on the movie The Ladykillers
(umm) Im a big Tom Hanks fan but I really wasnt all that impressed with this movie
It seemed like there was a lot of drag time in this movie
(umm) Yeah there were (stutter) some funny scenes but (uhh) very few
And (umm) for a Tom Hanks movie I was really let down
(umm) However that is my opinion and (umm) its rated R for language, crude scenes, (uhh) some violence and (umm) its a hundred and four minutes long
Theres several different actors in this movie
(umm) And however, you know, (stutter) its just not as great as I expected it to be
And again I think this is another movie where my expectations were a lot higher than they should have been
So (umm) Id probably give this one a two and if you wanna check it out (umm) you might like it better than I did
Thats The Ladykillers
Hello, Im doing a movie review of the movie Eragon
It is in theaters almost everywhere
Now Im a fan of Harry Potter, Ive seen all the Harry Potter movies
I also have seen all of the Lord of the Rings movies
Now the Lord of the Rings movies got a little long for me
Though they were still good
I found Eragons plot to be a little thin
And actually, while I was at Eragon I wanted to be Eragone out of the theater and away from that movie
Because I found it boring
It wanted me to go to, go to (stutter) sleep to be honest
{noise} So I (uhh) tried to struggle through it
I went to get some popcorn
Ate it, wondered if Id like the movie if I were eating and not paying full attention to it but I didnt really like it any more
Its probably a movie for younger boys
Younger boys who cant quite grasp a full plot
Its for younger boys who maybe have read the book too because then theyll like seeing everything they read in the book come to life
One thing I found cheesy and awkward about the movie was how the dragon and the main boy Eragon talked with their minds
Let me do an impression of them
That is what they looked like when they talked and it was awful
Hard to watch
But maybe the younger kids would like it
So if youre a younger kid then maybe watch it
Alright Expo TV, this is my video review of the movie Sweeney Todd
(umm) This movie, when I saw it, this movie looked sweet
I mean it had everything, it looked I mean it was about this serial killer like barber guy and it had Johnny Depp and he was dressed up looking all sweet and so I was like yes Im gonna go see this movie
I obviously did not do enough research before I saw the movie, which you are a good person if youre watching this video because youre trying to do some research before you go out there and spend the (umm) looks like six fifty on the movie
(uhh) This movie is a musical
So, if you dont like musicals, dont go see this movie
As soon as they started singing, I was just like, what did I get myself into, you know? I mean, I couldnt, I could not (stutter) get past that
So, if you can get past the fact that theres Johnny Depp singing in this movie, (uhh) more power to you I guess
Youre gonna enjoy this one
I did not
It has the same director as the guy from Nightmare Before Christmas
Figured this was gonna sweet movie, I didnt think hed, well I mean I really wasnt probably thinking at all, because if you think about it, The Nightmare Before Christmas is sort of like a musical
So, I dont know, I made a bad choice with this movie
I dont think its fair of me to give it a one out of five, but thats what Im gonna give it
Hello
I like to tell you about a movie I saw recently
Its Beowulf starring Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich
This movie could have been really great if they had taken into the direction of three-hundred or possibly Lord of the Rings, they didnt do that
(umm) The premise of the story (uhh) first of all this is a poem or a story written by an unknown character as its the first ever written that we have found (uhh) besides Homers
(umm) Its (uhh) a great story really about a lifestyle of people
(umm) Beowulf is a good guy
Grendel is a really bad guy, hes a monster
Beowulf and the community around him have to protect themselves from Grendel
(umm) Actually I this in college a very long time, for so long that you began to hate it but, then I look back and I kind of understand why it was important to learn about it
Actually I think Grendel was basically another group of people that were trying to take over another society
The monster possibly were wearing these huge face masks so this movie didnt portray it like that
They actually had Grendel as some really ugly monster and Angelina Jolie as a gorgeous mother who would make Grendel look like a sweet heart because she was so evil
So of her good looks because they didnt try to, you know, make her look evil, they just had her made her look like (stutter) Angelina Jolie with extra gloss
I mean, we dont need that, she has lips we know we see them she doesnt need that
So (umm) I am disappointed in the way it was presented
It is an epic tale, its a good story, its a great history about people, (umm) animation of the the (stutter) new age (uhh) type deal was terrible, and like I said she didnt fit the character
John Malkovich was okay he didnt help though
Hi, Im reviewing the movie Rocky Balboa, which is currently in theaters
It is the sixth edition in the Rocky series
(umm) Its its (stutter) gotten great reviews around but, to tell you the truth, I thought they should have stopped at Rocky one
(umm) I just thought this was too much
Sylvester Stallone was a great actor but hes now pushing sixty and having him in this role, you know, same old thing, you know
He goes out, we all know hes gonna fight, hes gonna win
So, it was a, its a typical Rocky movie but I see where it got some good reviews but Im pretty much a little tired of the whole Rocky scene
So if you werent liking Rockys three, four, five, then trust me, you do not want to see this movie
Dont waste your money
(uhh) I dont know how some people loved it
You know the acting was okay
You all know its the same thing over and over that happens with Rocky movies
If they would have stopped Rocky one, I think it would have been great but, you know
(uhh) (uhh) You know, scene wise, there are a couple of good scenes in it
So if youre a Rocky, I guess if youre a die hard Rocky fan, this is a great movie
But as I said before, if you if you (stutter) havent been feeling the other Rocky movies as of late, I wouldnt waste my time seeing this
I saw it because it was a friend of mine recommended it
But (ehh) it was a waste of time so keep that in mind before you go and waste ten dollars on this overrated and highly dragged out movie
What I have up for review here is the New Line platinum series widescreen edition of The Wedding Crashers, starring Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson and Christopher Walken
And this one is actually the uncorked edition
Longer, wilder and funnier
(uhh) The movie takes place during a wedding party (uhh) initially
(uhh) The two characters actually play wedding crasher where they try to charm their way into the hearts of bridesmaids and hope to go home with them later that evening
(uhh) But during this one party of the US (uhh) Secretary of Treasury, played by Christopher Walken (uhh) the guys, Owen Wilsons character actually finds himself falling for (uhh) the Secretarys daughter, and they invite them to go home with them to their estate over the weekend and he actually (uhh) pleads Vince Vaughns character to come with him and join him (uhh) over the weekend at this big estate
And most of the movie takes place at this estate
Its hilarious
(umm) I was laughing (stutter) right through the movie
I cant even stop laughing
(umm) And theres some special features which give about eight and a half more minutes to the movie
I suggest going to pick this up tonight if you were looking for a hilarious comedy
Go out and rent it, its great
Hello, Im going to do a movie review and it is about the previous number one movie Meet the Spartans
Well theres one thing that you need to know about Meet the Spartans, it is like three hundred, (stutter) obviously as you should know
(stutter) It has a British guy from (uhh) Off Center and also in other (stutter) like movies
(uhh) He also (uhh) was in (stutter) NYPD Blue like blue city and such
And like (umm) Well Meet the Spartans is a very cheap knock off
It wasnt that great, it was really bad
(stutter) It was spent a whole bunch of money on it, but it wasnt that great
Some (stutter) like people expected it to be great because of three hundred but it wasnt
Like it was pretty offensive
The things like like (stutter) the fight scene
Like when (umm) xxx it was really offensive and it wasnt that funny and like they were they (stutter) like pretty they go to the extreme all the time
Like, they also (umm) explain the riff of the materials they use so its like, what the heck? I, the first twenty minutes when I watched it, it was kinda like three hundred, but a little bit different by adding comedy
It wasnt that great, it wasnt (stutter) good and it wasnt that funny
Like, sure it has cheap cheap jokes
But it wasnt that great
Like seriously like (umm) (uhh) xxx (stutter) In the beginning they had like, theres a child like, as a seeing who which child can (uhh) get along and it was Shrek and youre like what the heck, thats pretty funny
Ha ha ha, but after awhile youre just like, oh okay
And its just like three hundred, but weirder and not, like they tried to be funny
You have to admit that
But its not that great, so I highly do not recommend you to watch Meet The Spartans
Hi, Im going to review for you today the DVD of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider
This is not a very good movie at all, but if you like the video game Tomb Raider its based on that and that was one of my very favorite favorite video games ever, and so of course I had to get the movie
(umm) The plot in its really bad
The actings not that great
Its fun to watch (umm) (uhh) Angeline Jolie be Tomb Raider, but I mean its not really not that interesting
Theres a lot of action and fighting and shooting, but the bad guys not even that bad, I think
Hes just does a typical overacting sort of job
(umm) If you can find it for cheap and you like Tomb Raider that would be a good thing to get it, but dont pay over five dollars for this
Its not really worth it
(umm) If you can see it on TV for free thats good too
But the DVD has special edition stuff so if you wanna see (uhh) behind the scenes and things like that
So if you can find it for cheap, buy it
Hello Expo, this is my video review for the movie Meet the Spartans
(umm) I came into the movie with very low expectations
Like, I knew it wasnt gonna be good
Since the trailer
I heard that people thought it was gonna be like, really hilariously funny and theyre not really smart
If they thought that way
And I watched it because I had nothing else better to do
Anyway, (umm) the movie is a parody of three hundred and a parody of other (stutter) movies and celebrities like Shrek, little bit of Happy Feet, You Got Served
(umm) Paris Hilton and other stuff
And (umm) there were probably two or three things that were kind of entertaining for me which is a surprise cuz I expected much of my expectations were much lower than two or three laughs
Cuz like I was expecting like, I was gonna stare at wallpaper kind of movie
And but there were some scenes that were, that went over the top with trying to make it humorous by, and, (stutter) it ended up just being disturbing or disgusting
And (uhh) lucky for me I have a way to like, shut that off like, if I know like a really horrible scenes gonna come up Im just gonna like, go into my zone
Or whatever
And I give this movie a two out of five because its a bad movie, thats no surprise
Even if you havent seen the movie you should know its a bad movie
But its not as bad as I thought it would be
You know
Hello expotv land
Its me, Danny Ericson, and Im here to talk to you today about the movie currently in theaters Meet the Spartans
And I dont know (stutter) why I did, but I went to this movie cause I knew I would hate it, cause I hate all movies like this
Like exactly what the Scary Movies have become, the last three-hundred they made, and things like The Comebacks
Theyre just all these lame attempts that just keep on referencing movies over and over and theyre just not even funny
Like, they just have, I just dont know how they come up with them, theyre not funny
Meet the Spartans was just the same way
(umm) Theyre talking about the Three-Hundred and really they just keep on bringing up things that arent funny
Theyre all trying to make this topical humor like Britney Spears, just all this ridiculous stuff that doesnt make sense and isnt, just not funny
I dont know why they keep on making these kinds movie and I just hope they dont make more movies like this, cause Three-Hundred just came out last year and they already made a parody of it
I just dont know
These people seem to not have anything else to do with their time
I just dont like it and I hope they dont keep on making more like this
Hello Expo TV
Tonight I would like to share with you Men Seeking Women, starring Will Ferrel and a couple other horribly unfunny people
(uhh) I highly advise you stay as far away (uhh) from this movie as you can
Its one of those things where a company has a movie with someone in it and they realize that person is now famous so they pull it out and put it on DVD to trick people into buying it because it has someone they love, being Will Ferrel
(uhh) It has him right there on the cover, (uhh) twice, in the picture and standing here
Hes all over the back, because no one else cares about the other people in this movie
(uhh) It has the little smarmy glasses wearing guy from Murphy Brown
(uhh) Its just not awesome
Its about these best friends and theres something about them trying to get married in a certain amount of time
I honestly cant even tell you that I watched the movie all the way through
It made me sick to my stomach
(uhh) Like I said its cheap, I think it runs like five bucks which is why I picked it up, I should of known better
But (uhh) consider this a warning to avoid Men Seeking Women
(uhh) Will Ferrel the parts that I watched you know hes kind of funny but the writing in its terrible and they dont really give him much to work with and it seems like he kind of may have had a jerk director that wouldnt let him you know do his thing and experiment and play around and be as (uhh) (uhh) improvious as he would want to be
Whats up guys I am going to review a movie that I think and actually many people agree with me (uhh) critics and fans alike that is one of or maybe the best war movie (umm) ever made and its called Saving Private Ryan it stars Tom Hanks of course (umm) Matt Damon and a cast of others including Vin Diesel if youre a fan of his and its about (umm) you know a setting in World War Two and a mother who has lost three of her four sons in the war, so there is one squadrons mission to go and find the fourth son whose name is Private Ryan (umm) the movie goes through that it goes through the realities of war and World War Two what happened there and what happened to them (umm) Its seen through the eyes of these soldiers you know they question their orders they dont understand why they have to risk their life (umm) Ryan questions his orders he just wants to stay and fight for his country (umm) and really just goes through their struggles of your your (stutter) everyday you know American soldier in World War Two, and its poignant and its beautiful, and you know it won five academy awards including best director Steven Spielberg of course you know its hailed by everybody Time Magazine, USA Today, New York Times, Entertainment Weekly, (umm) it won best picture award at the the (stutter) Toronto broadcast film critic special
Hi guys
(umm) Today Ill be talking about the movie Semi-Pro
(umm) This movie is the latest release (umm) in which Will Ferrell is the main leading character
(umm) Supposed to be a comedy movie but its not much comedy
I enjoyed Will Ferrells last movie Blades of Glory but this movies (umm) not up to that mark of comedy
(umm) In this movie (umm) Will Ferrell is the coach and the star player of the American Basketball Association team
(umm) The name of the team was the Tropics and then (umm) and there was a competition if their team xxx xxx xxx that then their team would be totally (umm) like moshed into some other team
So, he basically had to push all all (stutter) of his players to play a good nice game
But (umm) mean, it it (stutter) was (umm) not that interesting movie
So, (umm) Im probably gonna give this movie (umm) like two out of five
Hello, Will here and today Ill be reviewing Charlies Angels
(uhh) This is not the full throttle version, this is the first one
And its pretty good
I wouldnt go out and say, you know, go out of your way and buy it, but if you like (uhh) Drew Barrymore and Carmen Diazs acting, and Lucy Liu, go out and buy it
Otherwise its not really worth the price
(umm) It was okay
It didnt really (umm) reflect the series as well as everyone thought it should have, if youre a fan of the Charlies Angels TV series
I mean, the the (stutter) people elements are there, its just not really the same, so (umm) I dont know, with special features and all I would say you know, dont go out and get it
(umm) If youre going go out and get you know, you get this one and full throttle which is the second Charlies Angels (umm) together for cheap, go ahead but dont bother
Hey yall
Its the king of movies here and today Im going to (stutter) review Step Up Two the Streets which is a new movie in theaters
(uhh) Its a teen, teen kind of drama about (stutter) {burp} excuse me, dancing
(uhh) If youre interested at all in dancing (uhh) like (stutter) street, excuse me, street style dancing (uhh) like (uhh) (stutter) You Got Served and that kind of dancing you might enjoy this film
(umm) I thought it was pretty formulaic and (uhh) just like typical teen melodrama stuff that weve been seeing (uhh) for the last several years
(uhh) Just like regurgitated stuff
However I must admit that the choreographed dance scenes are (uhh) quite a sight to see and theyre really top notch
If youre a fan of dancing in that sense, just like to watch people dance, see impressive dance moves then you might want to check out this movie solely for that
The actual plot, however, is formulaic and not really worth seeing
Its kind of one of those movies where (uhh) its stretched out to ninety minutes just to be a full length movie but it would have been perfectly fine just showing the the (stutter) choreographed (uhh) dance scenes, like a ten minute short or like something on TV, or even just like put someone put up a clip on youtube of just people dancing
Its its (stutter) that kind of movie where they just stretch it out with an unnecessary plot thats formulaic and (stutter) try to turn it into a movie and it it (stutter) ultimately fails in in (stutter) the sense of a movie
Wouldnt recommend seeing it in theaters (umm) just because the plot and stuff like that is all just regurgitated and (stutter) formulaic
Instead (uhh) watch the dance scenes
Hopefully one day, when the DVD comes out or something, youll be able to just easily watch it on youtube or (uhh) rent it even, just to see the dance scenes because the rest of the movie is just there kind of to fill up space and make it ninety minute, minute (stutter) (uhh) feature length
(uhh) So if youre, so thats (uhh) Step Up Two the Streets
(uhh) If youre interested in dancing you might maybe check it out
If you have, if you hate dancing theres no point in even checking this out really cause the plot sucks and (uhh) the dancing is only there for people that enjoy dancing
Hey, ExpoTV
Today Im here to talk about the movie Boarding Gate
(umm) Watching this movie is probably one of the biggest wastes of my time (umm) in recent memory
(umm) I should have known that going in, but I didnt listen
(umm) What this movie is about is Asia Argento, who plays an ex-prostitute
(umm) And shes forced (umm) to flee England, (umm) London (umm) after a {sigh} bad encounter (umm) during one of her jobs
And (uhh), as you can tell, the movie is already completely ridiculous and not something you want to watch
(umm) But shes forced to flee, and she takes up with a different couple
And, you know, they promise to get her her (stutter) passport, her visa, all the necessary papers (umm) obviously in exchange for services
(umm) And it basically turns out to be a manipulation on the couples end against Sandra
(umm) So a completely ridiculous story
(umm) No value in watching this at all
You dont learn anything from this movie
You dont get a good feeling afterwards
(umm) After watching it, I just felt a little bit sick, a little bit disgusted, like why did I just waste my time watching that? (umm) So I think most people would get that feeling after seeing this
Like I said, theres really nothing that sticks out that would be even remotely good about this movie
(umm) Even the acting is poor
Hi, today Im going to do a movie currently in theaters for view for you of a movie called ten thousand B

(umm) ten thousand B

is about (umm) you know, it takes place in ten thousand B

(umm) A prehistoric culture (umm) and it kind of revolves around a young man who is hunting mammoths and (umm) trying to save his tribe
This movie though, this movie is absolutely awful
I (umm) I couldnt recommend this to anybody
Theres all kinds of things going around that dont seem to actually make any sense,(umm) especially in regards to historical accuracy
(umm) Number one, youve got you know pyramids being built, youve got vultures on like mammoths and youve got people of different kinds of (umm) races sometimes, its just like ten thousand B

, this is not probable
(umm) Its not true and (umm) the movie is really terrible
They dont develop into the characters at all
(umm) Throughout the duration of the movie I dont feel a sense to any of the characters
And also the acting is just some of the worst acting Ive ever seen
And If I could say this (umm) {laugh} just save your money
Hey, ExpoTV
This is Aubs eighty four and today Im going to talk to you about the movie The Wedding Director
(umm) This is a foreign film
(umm) Its set in France and its definitely subtitled
So if youre not a fan of sub-titles, youre gonna want to steer clear of this one
(umm) If you dont mind subtitles and youre into foreign films, I would still say dont get your hopes up
Its just, it really isnt that good
Honestly, I was bored out of my mind and couldnt wait for this film to be over
It was long
It it (stutter) drew on and on
(umm) In typical foreign film fashion, it was all about character development, and all about the background story and getting to know people
And, you know, generally I dont mind that
But when its, in terms of this movie it was just so pointless and didnt seem to go anywhere and was just kind of a big circle of ridiculousness actually
(umm) The basic plot of the story is that this guy, Franco, is a film maker and hes worried about (uhh) getting his daughter married to this extremist religious guy whos kind of crazy
So hes all whipped up about that and all of a sudden this scandal breaks loose and Francos forced to flee his country
He has to leave (umm) because hes kind of been indicted for some things
Hes not looking very good
Hes not gonna be making any more movies anytime soon in his homeland
(umm) So he leaves and in his new city, he ends up being there and he meets this guy who finds out hes a film director and says, well can you film my daughters wedding And Franco says, sure, Ill do that
And basically what happens is hes filming the wedding and he falls in love with this woman whos getting married
So its kind of, its all out there
Its a little bit ridiculous with the extremist religious thing at the beginning and then the scandal and then falling in love with the girl
And it kind of doesnt really fit together
(umm) I think any one of those three things could have been its own separate movie and it wouldve been a better production, rather than trying to ravel all three of these things into one long, drawn-out and ridiculous film
I think it would be enough to swallow (umm) the whole scandal thing
And I cant, I cant (stutter) even go into all the detail around the scandal thing because its so in-depth
And so (umm) convoluted and messy
You just kind of have to watch the movie and read the subtitles for yourself (umm) in order to figure it all out
And even for myself, I still wonder if I got the whole thing right
Its that messy
(umm) And that was my least favorite part about the movie was that scandal and the huge shebang that happened because of it
It, it (stutter) could have been simplified or done as its own movie where you can spend the time getting into and really explaining and delving into the whole situation
(umm) When you try to combine it into a whole other movie like it was done in this one, its just to much to digest
It would have took me another two or three viewings (uhh) just to to (stutter) figure this out
And I dont think any movie should be that complex or that complicated, foreign or not
I mean entertainment value here is what I want and thats not what I was given in this film at all
Im only gonna give it a one out of five rating
(umm) I cant think of anything (uhh) for the movie as a whole that would have increased that rating
(umm) If they wouldve broken it up I mean, then its just different films so you cant even, its comparing apples to oranges kind of
(umm) But that wouldve been a better alternative to what they did here
(umm) I Ive (stutter) seen some foreign film lately that I really enjoyed
I really got into the story line and really felt part of these characters
But this one was kind of fantastical and weird and out there and just not worth my time
Again, one out of five stars
Dont waste your time seeing it in a theater
Dont even waste your time renting this one
Its just not worth it
Whats up expo tv
I have a movie review for Superhero Movie
(uhh) Currently in theaters
Its about ninety minutes long and its rated PG-thirteen for (uhh) crude and sexual content, comic violence, drug references, language
(uhh) Its from the makers of Scary Movie but this ones rated PG-thirteen
(uhh) I guess so more people can see it
It its (stutter) not as good as the original Scary Movie, and its not as good as pretty much any spoof movie
I thought it was kind of bad
(uhh) I guess the movies about how (uhh) how this kid named Rick gets bitten by this dragonfly and and (stutter) he becomes known as, like the dragonfly because he gets all these like, superpowers like he gets I guess like, he gets really strong, his skin gets like tough
And (uhh) its just like I guess like (stutter) spoof on spiderman and pretty much every other superhero (stutter) movie thats currently out
(uhh) He goes off and fights crime against like this guy called the hourglass
(uhh) Not that good of a movie as I said
It could have been a lot better
(uhh) Its like one of the most stupid comedies, like you dont really laugh that much, but, but (stutter) you laugh at some parts but as soon as it ends youre like, I just wasted like, ninety minutes of my life and like like (stutter) ten dollars
(uhh) So I really dont recommend seeing it
Dont see it in the theaters
Do not see it on dvd
(uhh) Just completely ignore like this movie
I dont get how these movies get put in like like (stutter) theaters, or like production even
Like who wants to do this
Hello Expo TV
(umm) Today Im reviewing the movie Death Race
(uhh) This means two out of five
(uhh) It really wasnt very good
(uhh) It stars Jason Statham
You might recognize him from the Crank movies, where he was like a getaway driver kind of, drug runner
Anyways, (umm) where do I start? (umm) The movie takes place in two thousand twelve
Its about a guy that goes to prison for a crime he didnt commit
Its a like, for profit prison where they have this pay-per-view creation thats these death races and they have convicts racing in like cars with all kinds of crazy stuff like missiles and flamethrowers and machine guns and they kill each other and if you win, its five races, you get your freedom
So, thats kind of the premise of the movie
(umm) Honestly that sounds pretty stupid
I dont even know why I saw it
(uhh) But at least now you guys are warned
Dont see Death Race
(uhh) I wouldnt even rent it
Its really pretty bad
(uhh) I mean, theres a lot of action
If you like senseless action, Death Race is your movie
I am reviewing shop girl
Has Steve Martin, Claire Danes, and Jason Jason (stutter) Schwartzman and (umm) the movie is rated R
And it is described as a cute romantic comedy on the back
I would not recommend this movie at all {laughter}
It is based on a short novel or novella written by Steve Martin
And so I had these expectations that this movie would be along the lines of (umm) Roxanne or (umm) Youve Got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle, Never Been Kissed, that kind of cute romantic comedy
It is, to me very dark
(umm) Its actually a little odd
Its this girl (umm) basically is kinda torn between these two guys
A young guy thats not going anywhere and a rich older entrepreneur whos Steve Martin
But he has issues and the young guy has issues and theres a lot of sex in it and its, its just not a movie at all that I would recommend
Hello, my name is Mike, and today Ill be talking to you about the movie Traitor, which I went and saw last night
As formality, here is my movie ticket
And there it went
So, Traitor is a movie about (uhh), its a basic spy movie
The premise here is really not good in any way, shape, or form
But I will try to hack it together for you
So, this (uhh), sort of, straight-laced FBI dude is investigating (uhh), a bunch of crazy stuff that happened
And it turns out that this other sort of counter intelligence dude for the US, (uhh) is always seems to be connected to all of it
So, its, he has to figure out whats going on and why this is happening and is person number two involved with this, and is he a good guy or a bad guy, is the people is coming to help him investigate and are they good or bad is there other interests in here
Thats the premise
Its a really bad spy movie cause it really feels like theres no real story to it
Theres the investigation element, but thats it
You know, whats the story, whats the point
There is none
Thats the flaw of this movie
The script was written as sort of a, sub-element
You know, its missing the greater story to which the script plugs in to
And, thats why I cant give this movie anything more than a one out of five, cause it was atrocious
And this isnt worth seeing at all, cause I mean, come on, you can come up with better spy movies than this
There are so many
And I mean, not necessarily like spy like, James Bond, but counter, like you know, investigation spy movies
There are so many better ones to be doing
So, I have to say, one out of five
This was horrible
The premise is barely there at all
Its like a quarter of a movie but running the full length
Which is bad because the actors do a good job, but that cannot save it from being an atrocious pile of junk
So, one out five for Traitor
Hi there
I just returned from the theater and I saw this really really bad movie called (umm) Beer for My Horses and like I said, did I mention that it was bad? Well it was bad
It has Tom Skerrit in it, (uhh) thats not a reflection on him cause hes actually a good actor, its got Toby Keith, who hes a country music singer and if youre listening to country music thats fine but he really shouldnt be acting, and its also got (uhh) Ted Nugent
Hes a former (umm) rock singer or whatever but hes not really an actor either
So I mean youre youre (stutter) putting these people together to make this really bad movie and I guess thats what youre gonna get
Its rated PG-thirteen
The premise of it is theres these two deputies that are trying to do something
The sheriff doesnt really want them to do it but they do it anyway
So they take this road trip and thats kind of how the movie goes
and like I said, you watch it for yourself and see what you think
I mean I wouldnt recommend you watch it, cause it was bad enough that I watched it one time
(uhh) I wouldnt see it at the theater and I wouldnt rent it either
Id just try to forget about it
(uhh) Kinda like it was a bad dream, you know
Just forget it had ever happened
But (umm) thats my opinion anyway
Some Boards have provision for committee members to serve who are not full Board members, not voting members of the Board.
And this was another way to help bring in that expertise.
So you may not have all of the skills and abilities that you need for the audit committee on your full voting Board members but you among your committee members that expertise.
Student affairs academic affairs, thats another area where you may have some non-Board members serving.
For instance, we dont necessarily recommend the students serve as voting members of the Board because of conflict of interest concerns, but students could be a wonderful asset on the student affairs committee and can serve as full members of the committee and vote on proposals that will come before the Board but arent voting as full Board members when the resolutions of the Board are passed.
Hi, my name is Logan and this piece of dog crap is The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
This (uhh) stars Sean Connery
Its just so stupid
(umm) Its set in like the eighteen hundreds and its like fantasy and (uhh) you know, the (stutter) first of all the main star, or the main guy in (stutter), theres like all these like Captain Nemos in it and then other people, other famousishy people from around that time were in it
I have never heard of Alan Quartermain
I dont know what they were thinking when they decided that Sean Connery should star as Alan Quartermain
It doesnt make any sense but (uhh) I dont know
It its (stutter) pretty dumb
Theres like a vampire in it, an invisible guy, Captain Nemo, a guy that cant die cause hes like he starts out as a good guy and then he goes to a bad guy
Its really just a dull story line
It was an excuse to get Sean Connery into a James Bondish role without being James Bond cause they didnt want to pay for that and he (stutter) shoots people and he acts like oh Im Sean Connery {mumble} you gotta shoot people, this is how you do it
I cant do a very (stutter) good Sean Connery voice but this was really lame movie
I mean, come on Sean, cant do you do better than that? (stutter) Its just {sigh}
Its like he was really hurting for money so he picked the first script that came along
Its just a horrible, stupid movie
It doesnt make a lot of sense
The action sequences are sometimes way too long and sometimes theyre too short and it just, it jumps around, its like oh hes going to his, you know, his (uhh) his castle of fortressness, we have to go get him
So they go up into the mountains or something after the bad guy
Its like how do they know he was there? Why did he go there? Thats like the first place you would think he would go, why would you I dont know
It was a really dull story line, it doesnt make a lot of sense
Dont get this movie
Its from the director of Blade, that should have told me in the first place cause Blade sucked, this sucks
Dont rent it, dont buy it, dont waste your time
Hey
ExpoTV I am DJ Mel here and I will be reviewing myself, no I am not so why did I tell you my name? Anyways, today I am reviewing (stutter) Denzel Washingtons Deja Vu
This movie is, this movie is PG thirteen, thirteen, yes (umm) (uhh) This is starring touched, no (stutter) thats not him Im sorry (uhh) it is (uhh) brought to you by Jerry Bruckheimer Films and Touchstone Pictures
(umm) I wouldve, I watched this movie once, four years ago for something, didnt really like it, its (stutter) suspenseful but, meaningless at the same time and it has a confusing plot so if youre looking for a good watch, like a classic watch like youre going to watch an old movie, (umm) and youre youre (stutter) looking for an action or a suspense movie, dont get Deja Vu, youll get like Shanghai Knights
Just any Jackie Chan movie will do
So {laughter} anyways, this this (stutter) not a great movie, so yeah, dont watch it
Hi expo
Today Id like to do a movie review for you of a movie thats currently in theaters so I have my ticket stub for here, and thats Bride Wars
Bride Wars is a movie starring (umm) Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway as Liv and Emma who are two girls who are best friends who get engaged at about the same time and (umm) theyre plan to do everything together, being each others maids of honor, et cetera et cetera
And they both want to get married at the same place until they find out that only one of them can get married at the Plaza
(umm) And a small war between them begins (umm) because they both just (umm) dont want to make any compromises
This movie (umm) if you saw previews for it it looks kind of funny, but this movie actually wasnt very funny
It was very (umm) average, very predictable, and the acting wasnt that great
(umm) And you know I really do like to see fluffy chick flicks sometimes so Im not against that but this one was pretty terrible
And I definitely recommend that if youre considering going to see Bride Wars that you save your money because its not that good
So if youre looking for a movie to see with your girlfriends on a Friday night or a fluffy chick flick I would not recommend seeing Bride Wars because its not what you expect, its not worth the money, and its not that good
So I dont give it a good review
Bride Wars
Hello and welcome to my review of Pinata, Survival Island
This is a story of a bunch of college students who go to an island for (umm) a treasure hunt
And they end up breaking this ancient pinata which releases some demon and then of course, chaos ensues
This movie is pretty bad
It is (umm) {laugh} its less than a B movie
The only reason to see this is (umm) if you are a fan of Jaime Pressly or Nicholas Brandon, (umm) those are the two stars
(uhh) Jaime Pressly of course from My Name Is Earl fame and Nicholas Brendon from Buffy the Vampire Slayer
Only reason why the, to really to see this movie
The special features there arent very many, theres a feature commentary and some other junk but who who (stutter) really cares because this movie is pretty bad
(umm) I I (stutter) have to mention that on the back of the dvd it actually says evil has gone wack
So if that gives you any indication of where this movie is going, (umm) if that doesnt I dont know what will
So this is Pinata, Survival Island
You know, for the last few days Ive been trying to think of words to describe how it feels to be on the other side of APHs Annual Meeting from teacher, O&amp;M, CLVT, and user of products, to EOT in two different states and and now to APH employee
And I guess the first thing Id like to say it was really cool to celebrate my birthday with over 300 of my favorite people, so thank you very much for that
But you know, I was wondering was I was I like a proud mama and I thought no, that would insinuate that I had a hand in shaping this amazing organization and event and Im really much to new at APH to claim that, so I settled instead on Auntie as in Auntie Dorinda is so proud to be part of this organization and event and the deep roots and branches we build
 The depth of my feelings go way beyond that though to all of you
Im so grateful to all of you who traveled to Louisville and I know that you left overflowing email boxes that continued to overflow while you were here
And you left piles of work and you came here to participate in related meetings and in product sessions and our new roundtable discussions and Im really glad to hear that you enjoyed those
Im hoping were going to continue that in the future
And then of course the many celebrations and then the hallway conversations that we all enjoy so much
Im thankful for your day-to-day work making strides in improving the lives of the individuals that we serve
Im thankful for the APH staff who have worked tirelessly to put on this event
They make it look so easy, dont they? Chaired by Jaine Blome, guided by Craig Meador, and supported expertly by Jane Thompson and Scott Blome, as well as dozens of behind-the-scenes folks, you know who you are
This event has once again been seamlessly executed, serving as a needed antithesis to the current presidential campaign
&lt;&lt;Laughter&gt;&gt; Now thats something to be thankful for
&lt;&lt;Laughter&gt;&gt; As you head back out into the Year of Braille, I hope youll feel like your trunk is straight and strong, your roots run deeper, and your branches reach a little farther to your colleagues and friends across this great country
Travel safely and well see you next year
So there are a few particulars in using a home drug test, specifically this particular type of urine test, that merit, taking sometime to discuss.
Just some things that you may over look or you might gloss over the instructions and Im going to actually read a few of them, out of the instructions, to you.
Hello, I’d like to show you how to pronounce th and th in English.
Scott Reed talking: Some people in the community as the game has become more, um, more regarded . . . have raised the concerns about how we as graduate students have absorbed a lot of cost in producing the game and um . . . trust me, it concerns us too.
We’re not . . . we’re not rolling in any money here.
There’s a lot of real labor; there’s a lot of real capital that goes into the game.
And I think it’s . . . it makes sense that people be concerned about how we are aware of that.
We were lucky early on thanks to Doug Eyman to get some funding through Cengage; there wasn’t a very formal process to it.
We just asked if they were interested, and they helped us defray some of the costs.
I think in any given year, we’re looking at roughly $1,500 or so in terms of the cost of actually putting on the game.
put myself always in the shoes of the victim.
I was a victim of a horrible crime when I was young, and went on after that to a career as a defense attorney, and understand that no matter what the crime is, there needs to be a just process.
But when I put myself in these situations and I see a Nazi camp guard killing Jewish people in the morning before breakfast, in my minds eye.
Or I see what happened in the Rwandan genocide, with the slamming of babies against the walls of churches, you know, of families seeing their own children killed in front of their eyes, and other loved ones.
We are now inside the main auditorium, where family and friends will witness the entire event - what a fanatic view their are treated too today
up outside of the IDI exhibition last fall, and on that table there is a sign that reads: Congratulations to Irish designers for making an impact with universal design
And on that table theres numerous publications, again many of you here have helped with those projects, and these are about Building for Everyone, about human body size impact on design, customer services for energy suppliers, and the tourism industry, and many, many more and more to come that are in the works

Welcome back to Film Producing 101 on behalf of Expert Village.
So our next topic here--Im looking down.
Im Don Varney of Varney Speaks and on behalf of Expert Village.
Today were going to talk about the interview process.

For over 10 years HOCK international has offered high-quality CIA study materials in English, and now in partnership with Al-Joman Consultancy in Amman, Jordan, (Sarh Al-Joman Training) we are pleased to offer our high-quality CIA Textbooks in Arabic.
The Arabic Textbooks are not just a direct translation of the English materials - they were carefully translated by a team of experts who understand both English and Arabic.
This has resulted in Textbooks that will read like they were written originally in Arabic.
In addition to the Textbooks, some past exam questions have also been translated and are included with the Textbooks as a separate question document.

Hey, yall, hows it going? My name is Jordan, and (uhh) today Im gonna be reviewing the DVD Godzilla
Now, this movie well if you saw it, then you probably dont need to watch any more of this review
(umm) The movie kind of speaks for itself
(uhh) Its not really a great movie
Matthew Perry is actually Not Matthew Perry
Whats his name? I think his name is Matthew Perry
(uhh) Matthew Perry
I think his names Matthew Perry
Its the guy from Ferris Buellers Day Off
I think his name is Matthew Perry
Im pretty sure
(umm) Yeah
Hes the guy (umm) whos the big hero in the movie, and (umm) I dont think that he could really be a hero in a movie
(umm) He wasnt very good (umm) at you know trying to solve the big problems or anything like that
(umm) The effects in this movie were not that great
This was actually after Jurassic Park came out and (umm) in this movie, the effects look worse than Jurassic Park, so people went expecting, you know, (umm) you know, effects that would actually look better, but no, they didnt look nearly as good as Jurassic Park
(umm) It actually looked kind of similar, it looks like they kind of copied some of the stuff from Jurassic Park, but (umm) as far as special features go, I mean it has a little bit of special features
Not a whole lot, but it has like how they created you know, some of the (umm) some of the character, you know, CGI stuff, and everything like that, and how they destroyed a lot of the buildings and stuff like that, but I mean, the movie kind of just isnt that great, so I mean you probably dont wanna pick this DVD up because (umm) the movies not that great, so you wont be that interested in the special features, so (umm) Id skip over this one and (uhh) look for another one
Ernst &amp; Youngs Fraud Investigation &amp; Disputes Services team has released research showing employees consider expense fraud as more serious than stealing physical company property (20%), drinking during work (13%) and breaching of licensing arrangements (10%). Unusual or lavish claims for expense reimbursements can also point to other types of fraud, including bribery.
But it totally went wrong
I saw a big red cross on a page like engraving the cross on my heart
Since the moment, it was too hard to smile for me
Many people asked me what happened, but I always replied them nothing and they just left
It was my first time to feel no one is on my side in the world
Maybe I can say it was one of the worst days in my life, but it changed to one of the best days in my life later
One girl, who looks very chill, stayed beside me instead of saying something
She didn’t say anything but stayed until I left the school
&gt;&gt; Well, this is my first time at Davos.
Ive watched earlier meetings on television, but its interesting to be here.
The one thing that really stands out is no matter which conference I attend, there seems to be very close to a consensus on many issues.
&gt;&gt;Van Jones: Hello, You Tubers.
My name is Van Jones.
Im with an organization called Green For All.
Were sister organization for the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights in the United States of America.
I think that one thing we all need to be focused on is building a green economy that is strong enough to lift millions of people out of poverty.
Hi, Im Brad Bear on behalf of Expert Village.
And in this clip I want to cover getting digital cable or high definition cable into your HD TV set.
Now with broadcast, you know when youre just receiving over the air, with an antenna, if you buy a TV that says High Definition tuner inside, thats what thats for.
It will allow you to receive High Definition signals into your set.
With cable, its a little bit different.
Different cable systems encode their system channels a little differently, so youre going to have to get the box from them.
DAVID WALKER: Tracking the recovery in the recession, on really a very local basis around the country, is a mirror image of how we fell into recession.
Moodys did some excellent county by county progressive deterioration of the economy across the United States.
And you could really see where home foreclosures, where unemployment, where loss in credit, really took shape, and where it had its greatest intensity.
And our hypothesis is its going to exactly mirror that as we come out of recession.
Hi Im Jessica Smith on why people should save money.
People need to save money because first of all that is what the constitution of the United States was built around.
Any great country out there saves, that is how the country is able to grow.
As Americans we live off of immediate gratification and dont save anything.
This is financial adviser Patrick Munro talking about what is a nature of an unsubsidized loan?
I believe that the consumers have very much a voice in how your brand is perceived, because theyre the ones doing the perceiving.
Caine: Well I think that the speakers and recipients of the awards were just amazing.
It’s just an incredible … with this challenging environment, that the power and the motivations, and the leadership just generated from the speakers was just, it was very emotional.
I want to be a Salvation Army officer because I really strongly believe that God has called me to officership.
Its such a humbling experience to know that such a powerful and sovereign God would want to use somebody like me to be His representative.
For me officership is not anything about me and what I can offer, but its all about what God can do through somebody like me.
Hi Federationists! Lauren McLarney here with the Government Affairs team
Im on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC
Its freezing! But Im really excited because in two weeks were going to do one of the coolest things that we do as an organization
500 Federationists are going to come here to DC and were going to hike the hill together to tell our members of Congress about our legislative priorities and the things that we need to live the lives we want
Our three legislative priorities this year are the Transitioning to Meaningful and Integrated Employment Act or the TIME Act, the Technology, Education and Accessibility in College and Higher Education Act or the TEACH Act and the Marrakesh Treaty
Here are some more details about the three legislative priorities

Im Rose Sloan and this year we are advocating for the Transitioning to Integrated and Meaningful Employment Act or the TIME Act
The title of the TIME Act explains exactly what we want nonprofits who hold Section 14(c) Certificates to do
We want them to transition their business model to ensure that all people with disabilities, especially those being paid subminimum wages have the opportunity to transition into integrated and meaningful employment that they strive for
Currently, over four-hundred thousand Americans with disabilities are being paid less than the minimum wage, some of them mere pennies per hour
But the TIME Act will give nonprofit entities three years to transition their business model and ensure that all people with disabilities are paid the fair wages we deserve
Its time for people with disabilities to receive fair wages
The second issue this year is the Technology, Education and Accessibility in College and Higher Education Act or the TEACH Act which works to address a problem facing far too many blind and otherwise print disabled students in college
The print world is inherently inaccessible to blind people and electronic instructional materials like PDFs and learning management systems and ebooks
They offer the opportunity for blind students to use the exact same materials as their sighted peers and luckily the law actually requires that institutions of higher education provide equal access
The problem is that requirement has no specifics, no criteria, no guidelines telling schools this is what accessibility looks like and this is what you should demand from the market
Schools have no idea what to ask for, manufacturers arent really embracing accessibility solutions and blind students are the ones that pay the price
The TEACH Act authorizes the creation of voluntary accessibility guidelines so this is what accessibility looks like, this is what you should demand from the market and then incentivizes schools to only use technology that conforms to those guidelines with a safe harbor from litigation
Our goal is to improve access for blind students, reduce litigation and stimulate an accessible digital marketplace
Hi, this is Scott LaBarre and Im here to talk to you about the Marrakesh Treaty, whats also been called the Book Treaty
 This year we are going before the United States Senate and urging them to ratify the Marrakesh Treaty
This would allow us to get books from all over the world in foreign languages and even in English that are already produced in Braille or other accessible formats
It will allow the rest of the world to get access to the collections we have here in the United States
We believe that the right to read, the right to information is a fundamental right and by ratifying Marrakesh we will secure a major victory in our right to read campaign
Now that you have all the details I hope youre as excited as I am
Last year was an election year and a lot of people were complaining
Hi, my name is Anaj and today Im reviewing the movie Boxing Helena
(umm) Its a psychological thriller, if you havent watched it its a nice movie
Its about this doctor whos kind of psychologically (uhh) crazy
Hes really generous, you know, really rich, but he wants this girl whos kind of a seductress and (uhh) well the movies R rated
It has some (uhh) adult scenes in it with them
And (uhh) its an alright movie, I didnt like the acting of the guy (uhh) Julian Sands and Sherilyn Fenn so the acting was just alright
(uhh) A onetime movie, definitely not my type though
It it (stutter) is a thriller (umm) he wants this woman, the woman is you know not interested in the guy so he finds a (uhh), I wont tell the story but he gets possession of this girl and then tries to take care and win her heart over, but (uhh) the storys (uhh) related to that
Watch this movie (umm) one time see, not bad
DVD (uhh) Im not sure if youd want it in your collection, I wont suggest it though
(uhh) Not many special features either
Now, maybe go shopping sounds right for your business, but maybe not.
Its important to consider what other financing options you have available.
Spending on your business, you might want to start seeking investment.
Angel investors, venture capitalists, accelerators, and incubators all provide different opportunities to get the resources that you need.
Hi
Im reviewing the (uhh) DVD release of Basic
It stars (uhh) John Travolta and Samuel Jackson
Its (uhh) a military movie
(umm) John Travolta is sent to, to (stutter) investigate the disappearance of Samuel Jackson whos (uhh) a disliked drill sergeant
(umm) They think hes too tough on the recruits and they think that he may have gotten some of them killed
(umm) I did not care for this movie at all
(uhh) The twists and the turns werent really inspired or creative or (stutter) even interesting
It just seemed like they came up with random things to happen that (uhh) I dont know
It just, by the time you get to the end of the movie it felt like a waste of time to have watched any of it
Hi Im reviewing Postmortem
Starring (uhh) Charlie Sheen (umm) I guess now hes trying to take himself seriously since the box says, Charles Sheen, but (uhh) this is not a movie I would pick if I was Charles Sheen to launch my serious movie career
(uhh) In the movie he plays a (uhh) serial killer profiler
Which there are a million of in movies
And he retires to become a novelist but he moves to a small town to get away from it all and it turns out that the small town has a serial killer so he has to help track him down
(uhh) Its not (uhh) a very good movie
I didnt enjoy watching it, theres no special features
(uhh) So its a pretty poor DVD
(uhh) Overall I really cant say anything positive about this, I wouldnt recommend watching it
(uhh) I actually think it went straight to DVD
Hello and welcome to the steel detailing division of TMG.
As you are probably aware, even if you use the most advanced application-specific programs, the job of steel detailing is still labor-intensive.
Whether it be creating structures or drawing up bills of material, skilled inputs cannot be avoided.
You may be finding yourself tired and fatigued on a regular basis and were going to try to help you through that.
It used to be when I was younger and I would give a speech, I could go into that room and I could tell stories and I could paint who I am based on the stories I painted in that room.
Today, everyone has done a search on Marty Abrams before I go into the room, and they have looked at what I’ve written, they have seen my interviews in the media, they’ve seen pictures of me, they’ve seen videos of me.
They already have an impression of who I am.
So I’ve been defined by the digital content that exists about me before I even give that speech.
So in the old days, I could define myself based on the stories that I told.
Today I go into a room and I’m already painted by that history.
That is this exists when we go out to look for a job.
Deputy CEO and Tax Chairman of KPMG India Dines Kanabar has asked the government to clarify its new and controversial General Anti-Avoidance Regulations.

FEMALE SPEAKER: When I hear advertising I think of billboards, stuff in the magazine, ads of models.
MALE SPEAKER: Images that entice you to buy something.
The Hills Have Eyes Two
I enjoyed The Hills Have Eyes, the remake that came out a couple years ago and (umm) this is the sequel to it, of course
(umm) Going into the movie I knew the plot
You know, its the hills have eyes, the first the one the family gets trapped, stays in the hills, (umm) which used to be, they used to test nuclear weapons there
Some of the people stayed, they killed the people, and thats what happens
So in this one its (umm) the same premise, nuclear testing still going on the grounds
This time the army goes in there to test weapons and (umm) they go in there to to (stutter) do stuff, they have (umm) workers and stuff go in there, and (umm)
So if you saw The Hills Have Eyes One youre probably thinking why not add soldiers? But (umm) it was it was a bad movie
it wasnt the worst movie, and on a scale of one to ten Id say it was probably a three
(umm) But it was, it was (stutter) bad
I knew it was going to be bad
I wanted to see it just to see it
But I knew going in it was going to be bad and it wasnt as bad as I thought it was gonna be
(umm) It was still pretty bad, you know? Most of the people in the movie I didnt know
(umm) A couple of the people I did, I knew who they were, but (umm) it (stutter) was a very bad movie
(umm) Like I said, nuclear testing and then the army goes in to to (stutter) do stuff and then most of them get killed
Hello again
This is the Derek, this time with another DVD review and this one is one of (uhh) I mean come on if you were ever a teenage boy or (uhh) in the eighties or nineties or even nowadays, every party has a little (stutter) bit of a nerd, you will love Rush, the rock band Rush
This is a concert (uhh) DVD that came out
Its a double disk (uhh) Rush R30, so their thirtieth anniversary world tour, has a DVD one is one entire huge concert live that pretty well plays every one of their hits (uhh) including most of the twenty-one twelve (uhh) over (uhh) their (stutter) (uhh) to (umm) all some some (stutter) new ones like earthshine
(uhh) spanning thirty years of their career of such a phenomenal band (uhh) that, that (stutter) really is more influential to rock (uhh) and than than (stutter) so many other bands out there, I mean there are still going today
(umm) The second disk has a bunch of interviews with them, it has a vault of other, you know, music videos and some more live performances
But one of the special things for this whole box set is really when you open it up, it has such a beautiful presentation to any fan that shows you (uhh) a retrospective of the the years, has a (uhh) a live CD over here so you can listen to the live concert in your car, has the two disks, it also has (umm) some (uhh) autographed (uhh) guitar picks
They are not really autographed by they have their signatures on them from Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson and also has a (uhh) great little booklet of photos with (uhh) other trinkets it thrown in like stickers, (uhh) (stutter) and a replica of a backstage pass so you can pretend that you were ever at one of these concerts
Its a great (uhh) box set, amazingly good sound, (uhh) lots of easter eggs on here, they even say on the back good luck finding them, but I cant recommend it better if you are a fan to listen to one of their greater concerts that they have put on a long time in adobe five point one audio
I definitely pick it up if you are a fan, if you just are a kid today and want to know what a great rock band out there is still living and, and working and breathing sounds like you know, pick it up and check it out
Im doing a review for the movie Ghost Rider starring Nicolas Cage and Eva Mendes
(umm) This was probably the worst Marvel movie I have ever seen
(uhh) Its even better than Dare (stutter), or even worse than Daredevil I mean
I actually liked Daredevil a little bit, but this was just awful
(umm) It stars Cage as the Ghost Rider, a supernatural (uhh) bounty hunter of the devil, who has to go and chase another bad guy called Black Heart (umm) before he can collect souls and become super powerful
(uhh) The story was really boring
(uhh) It didnt go anywhere for a long time
(uhh) The special effects were pretty good, Ill give them that
(uhh) Watching (umm) Nicolas Cage transform into the Ghost Rider and back, seeing his flesh peel away, things like that
It was cool to see that
(uhh) But other than that there werent many positives in this movie
(umm) It was just, I was just waiting for this movie to be over it was so boring
(umm) Eva Mendes cant really act well, but she is extremely easy on the eyes
So if you need an excuse to see that movie (uhh) fellas, thats one
This is a review of the dvd movie Gosford Park
(umm) It came out in two thousand one on USA Films, also on Universal
(umm) {laugh} Im not gonna lie I saw the previews for this movie in two thousand one when it came out
For some reason I had thought that this was going to be like (uhh) like a horror movie and people were going to be like getting killed in this house and it was going to be really sweet
And I always like it had been a movie in the back of my head that Id been wanting to rent or buy for a long time
And I rent movies online and I put, {laugh} put it in my list and sure enough I get it and it is nothing like that
Its like an old stool like (umm) you know like a murder theme mystery in someones house
(umm) with like British accent people, English accents
And (umm) I dont know, I, it definitely seemed more like a B film to me
I wasnt too impressed
(umm) Even like the cover like makes you think its gonna be like some xxx nation like wrong turn, I dont know some sort of horror movie or something
And this really wasnt
I wasnt too impressed I hardly watched any of it and (umm) I was kind of let down, (umm) I thought the original previews in two thousand really led me astray and then I rewatched (umm) one on the internet (umm) today right, (uhh) right as I was watching it and it {laugh} seemed a lot different so I dont know maybe theres another Gosford Park out there but this Gosford Park is sure not (umm) a horror movie, so (uhh) dont rent it
If youre looking for a horror movie
Is it still a buyer�s market today in Washington DC? As experts in the Washington DC real estate market, we get asked this question a lot, and the answer isn�t as simple as yes or no

I�m Brad Chandler from Express Homebuyers and I would like to talk with you about the real estate market in Washington DC
The market really depends on the property type and location because while single-family homes, in great locations that are priced well, have been flying off the shelves, there are other areas that are a bit slower
To better explain - I would like to talk about some different factors that play a role in the market
First of all, buyers are often looking for the same thing , which is good neighborhoods, access to transportation and shopping, good schools, and being close to work, to name a few
Properties that deliver all these conditions are definitely a hot commodity and sellers with a highly desirable property are in control of the market
Secondly, investment properties are in demand
The massive amounts of foreign cash flooding into the US to invest in real estate has impacted the Washington DC area in unique ways
Overall, those people in a position to pay cash for properties have been picking up the good deals in the marketplace
Lots of sellers are trying out speculative prices just to see if anyone bites, but most investors are walking away from deals that don�t pencil out
Thirdly, financing is still a major obstacle for buyers
Banks are still being strict, requiring money down and even changing their terms at the last minute
It�s not uncommon for approved buyers to get their loans denied right before their closing, although it�s getting better than it was just a couple of years ago as credit standards have begun loosening somewhat again
In general, the markets remain strong
If you are trying to decide whether or not to sell your house, we can help you
There�s a lot of shakeup in the US economy still taking place with the markets moving fast and in lots of directions at once, but we�re investing in the Washington DC area because we believe in the community and the people here
number more than five
Some people number all the boxes
The order you number candidates is important and will impact on which candidates are elected
Candidates win by reaching a quota — a certain number of votes
The quota is based on the overall number of votes and is different for each region
In the following examples, we show you how proportional representation works when 3 candidates are elected
For real Legislative Council elections, 5 members are elected
Candidate 4 has more votes than the quota and is elected
The votes over the quota are called surplus votes
These are shared among the remaining candidates
To work out who gets more votes, we can not just look at the ballot papers of the surplus votes
my brother-in-law, Hunter, set up a mock government
We elected a president, we had a house and a senate, there were lobbyists involved

Issac, as president, ended up vetoing it, and then we had a supermajority, and we overrode him
It was just a lot of fun
We were learning a ton, the kids were loving it, and ultimately, it ended up in a Supreme Court battle
I was representing the kids, saying that the law was unconstitutional, and Brent was representing the state, and I wasnt able to show all of what happened in this vlog
Hi, so youre a homeowner, and youre wondering how to build equity in your property.
No problem, Ill be able to tell you that.
&gt;&gt; Hi, Im Mike Brandl from the University of Texas at Austins McCombs School of Business and welcome to this version of the Macro Updates.
Last night, President Obama gave a speech that did many things including talking about his future economic policies.
I want to take a look at some of the suggestions President Obama laid out and what sort of missing in a lot of the press coverage.
One of the things that we see the press constantly talking about is this issue of potential nationalization of the banks.
Our financial institutions have gotten themselves into so much trouble that maybe the only answer is that the government takes them over.
But if you look at President Obamas speech last night, he made it clear that thats really not the path he intends on taking.
Instead he discussed the need for potential more funding of banks, but to hold those banks responsible for that length or for the money that they get to try to ensure that they actually lend that money to individuals, to businesses and so on.
Now, there werent a whole lot of specifics on how exactly he is going to do that, so I think it would be very interesting to look and keep an eye on what the next phase of bank bailouts are going to be and how specifically is he going to force those banks to lend.
The second issue that Obama brings up and I think one that needs to be looked at very, very carefully is he talks about creating a new lending fund that is going to ensure that more money will make its way to households to buy automobiles, to fund college education and also to entrepreneurs.
Its going to be very interesting to see what exactly does he mean by that.
Does he mean potentially that the government is now going to create its own lending facility to compete directly with the commercial banks?
If so, is that a way to try to force more competition in the banking system, to try to get those banks to start lending?
I think its going to be very interesting to watch how the details unfold on what exactly he means by this new lending fund.
Hi, this is Elaine Low with Investor’s Business Daily.
I’ve got a quick after-hours update for you.

Today I want to talk to you about a DVD
The DVD I want to review is Beauty and the Beast by Disney
(umm) This is the platinum edition, its a two-disc special feature
(umm) This is a great DVD
Actually, its one of the greatest, one of the greatest cartoons ever made
Its got a great score, its got a great story
(umm) Its a classic
I mean youve got some great comedy, you know, great songs xxx
Of course its rated G so the whole family can enjoy it
(umm) You actually get two, two versions of the film
Actually three versions of the film
You get some extra music, you get a Celine Dion video, you get never before seen footage, you get a video game on there, you get all types of good stuff
Commentaries
(umm) I would definitely recommend this, like I said, its one of the classics
This is a review for the movie Pathfinder
(uhh) What Pathfinders about is its about before America was discovered by (stutter) Christopher Columbus it was discovered by vikings
And it tells the story of some vikings that came to (uhh) America around the Canadian area
And for some reason they left, and they left behind one of their kids and the kid got picked up by Indians and he was raised by Indians
Then like twenty years later the vikings come back to to (stutter) take over the land and the kid has, is now a grown up and hes part of the Indian culture and hes going to stop the vikings from taking over the Americas and ruling them and killing them all cause theyre very savage people
And theyre very big monstrous creatures in the movie
Its a terrible, this is a terrible movie
I do not recommend you go see this because its awful
Its full of cliches, its got a stupid love story in it like everything in theaters now
And its just ridiculous
(uhh) I wanted the fricking bad guy to die the entire movie, I wanted the good guy to die, I wanted everybody to just die so it would be over and I wouldnt have to listen to it anymore or watch it
I was falling asleep half the way and it was ridiculous because (uhh) ticket prices are so expensive so I dont recommend you see this
If you really, really want to see it rent it with like Netflix or something so you dont have to pay for it
Its terrible, I dont recommend it
Its called Pathfinder, so avoid this
Its in theaters
On patient financing here in the office; of course one of the things we try our best to do is get good accurate information on their insurance
If they have dental insurance, we want to get as accurate information as we can so we can estimate things well for them
One thing we are constantly talking about with that end of the practice is we don’t want patients to have surprises
We want them to know what to expect, try to give them as good an estimate as we can with their insurance
That can be interesting at times dealing with their insurance companies because they’re sometimes a moving target
But we do file folk’s insurance, we estimate what their copay should be and have them pay that at the time of service, but then we have the insurance reimburse us
It’s interesting when it comes to insurance, there are all the time, CE courses, continuing education courses out there of people giving their recommendations
A big thing that was going around a few years ago was, have the patients pay it all up front and let the insurance reimburse them
Well, that’s not real customer service related and there are folks who tried that and found out real quickly that didn’t work so well
So we file the insurance, do the paperwork, and when it comes to what the patient’s portion is, whether they have insurance or not, I mean depending on what they need, sometimes I can it can be more than what you want to write a check for out of your checking account this week
The primary financing option we use is something called Care Credit, it gives some great interest free options so it’s a great way to break down some bigger expenses that way
We’re always looking for new things; and we’ve had some other programs like Care Credit, we still use some of them but Care Credit seems to be the one that we get the best approval rating, approval from for patients
We’re always looking for new things that we can do to help patients in that area
We’re actually looking at an in-office discount plan of some kind especially for our patients without insurance
That topic has come up before so that’s something we’re looking at and maybe something we can offer here in the near future
Just one more option for folks to kind of get a little bit of a savings, a little bit of a break on things and plus, it benefits us because folks keep coming to see us that way too
The big thing with financial things in the office is we like patients to know what to expect
There’s nothing like coming in and thinking you’ve got a hundred dollar thing you’re having done and walk out front and the ladies tell you it’s five hundred dollars
Surprises like that are not good
Hey there Expo TV goers
I just witnessed a terrible movie that was called TMNT, or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as they used to call it when it was good
This is a computer animated version of our beloved turtles and it is nowhere near as good as those great, early nineties, real life Ninja Turtles cheese fests
This Turtles movie is terrible and it has the worst plot and cliche, collecting orbs and stuff xxx Ive ever seen in my life
And theres (uhh) the chick is like has like a staff and she hits people with it
And I hated it and animation was pretty terrible
Looks like a video game cut scene, with the exception of one rain fight which was pretty cool
(umm) All the catch phrases were there, Splinter was there, he was cool, but I didnt really like it
So, dont see it
I worked for Coca Cola and the factorys based in North London in Edmonton.
The office that I worked in was above the factory and it was my job to be part of the production planning team and we told the factory what to make to meet customer demand.
To begin with, it was just getting used to learning how the factory actually runs and what goes into just like the simple task of making bottled drinks.
It was our job to work with the central  operations, to know what the customer demand was around the UK and in France and then with that, you also have to work with suppliers to make sure you get the right materials in in order to keep the factory running.
What I got from this role was mainly confidence, like the change throughout the year, like when you started, one of the main roles is to go to a meeting every morning where youre talking to the leaders of each Department.
By the end of it, obviously my confidence.
it had increased massively from the start, when youre a bit shy, when you walk in.
Technically Ive learned a lot and systems that Id never even knew existed so to come away with that, to write that on my CV that Ive got, is really helpful.
But my main connection was working with the people from head office so there were times when I then went to work in head office with the people there and they allowed me to work within  all the different departments at Coke not just to stay set in the planning department but you got to see, spend like a few days working with each department, so Ive seen a massive overview of the whole supply chain world.

This can be a really difficult thing for physiotherapists to handle.
PTs dont want to embarrass their patients or appear insensitive.
It is important to remember that as the health professional its up to you to maintain the professional boundaries, even when the behaviour is instigated by the patient.
So what can you do?
The first thing you need to do is identify what is wrong with the behaviour with the patient.
Secondly, you need to tell the patient what it is that you expect from them and any policies you have in your clinic about appropriate behaviour.
And then finally the patient really needs to understand that if they dont change this behaviour there may be consequences.
For example, the consequence may be that if they continue with the inappropriate comments youll have to discontinue their treatment.
If you are searching for a good investment option, consider betterment.
Betterment is a relative new company on the investment market and theyre really making a name for themselves pretty quickly.
They boast about smarter investment for busy people and they really seem to be able to do that.

But its a great color
BBVA and Accenture announced on Tuesday a landmark technology systems upgrade at BBVA Compass.
Alright, this is the (uhh) movie Dances with Wolves and if I were asked to put a top ten list of movies, this would definitely be in that list
Absolutely fantastic movie made by Kevin Costner, it won seven academy awards back in nineteen ninety-one and if you havent seen this movie, then where have you been because this movie is fantastic
All about captain John Dunbar and his growing up in the frontier and encountering (uhh) the native American xxx tribe and its just a fantastic so (uhh) really beautifully filmed
(uhh) The music is fantastic, the acting is great (uhh), one thing I should mentioned is almost four hours long, its three hours and what fifty-six minutes long
(uhh) Its probably up (stutter) in nineteen ninety-one when this came out
Never had a show ever been released this long and I dont think there has been a show since then
Lord of the Rings wasnt maybe more than maybe three and a half hours
Very long movie but, (stutter) the time flies by, absolutely fantastic
Now it is rated PG thirteen
(uhh) Theres some tense scenes in it, some hunting scenes
(uhh) The sexual amount in it is some xxx (uhh) but nothing overt (umm) that I can recall
(umm) So, the PG thirteen rating I think is primary theres some a little bit profanity in it and theres like I said some tense scenes
But absolutely fantastic show, you gotta watch this if you havent seen it
Many campaigns sort of start with one key insight and then evolve to sort of the next platform.
So there’s been a lot of talk today about the state of the economy.
We’ve all lived through it.
It has not been-- it’s been a tough ride.
So last summer, even going into last spring, we were really seeing kind of the downturn that everybody else was experiencing.
And travel, somebody mentioned it earlier, for many people is incremental.
Even business travel.
I mean we were seeing and hearing from customers that, “Hey, I normally go see my clients twice a month, well now I’m only allowed to go see them once a month.” Well, for that consumer, we just lost half their travel budget.
That’s, you know, pretty frightening statistics.
And then on the leisure side, you know, we all learned a word that is not a friendly word in the airline language, which is a staycation.

LORRAINE TWOHILL: I think engaging with communities is absolutely imperative right now.
Its definitely a trend and I think why its important is this is all about passion.
So people form a passion around something, a love for something, whether its a love for a particular type of food product, or a game, or a sport, or whatever it is, or character, or music.
They form a passion, they form a community around something that there is a commonality in.
I think the University of Manchester has a lot to offer a prospective PhD student, theres an awful lot of support, like I mentioned earlier, the Speed PhD course was really good at introducing the PhD and on the whole the training that youre offered and support in that way is really good.
All kinds of things from communication to more specific research skills, data-handling, things like that (and statistics) are really well trained and if you want that training, its there for you to take.
I really enjoyed that.
Theres some films that are really comical and just rather funny without meaning to be
One such film is Reign of Fire
This film {clears throat} is about a dragon even though theres about eight seconds total of dragon in the entire film
A dragon population that takes over the world
Its set in England (umm) and its mainly in a castle where a few survivors live and just scratch on day by day
They dont really live, its just survive
(umm) {clears throat} The scene takes a twist with Matthew McConaughey, Im sorry, Matthew Slab of Beef McConaughey enters the (uhh) scene as a (uhh) US (uhh) military man that is trying to combat the dragons
Hes developed a plan to destroy them and he is relying on the inhabitants of the castle to help carry it out
{clears throat} The acting is over the top, shoddy, hilariously done even though its not meant to be
As far as a serious film? Do not rent this
But if youre looking for something to make fun of (uhh) I would definitely (umm) definitely pick this up just to sit around and poke fun of
Martin Luther King We must meet hate with love Martin Luther King Jr.
was one of Americas greatest leaders.
He was not a president, but his birthday is a national day in the US.
Presidents are the only other Americans who are remembered in this way.
King became famous around the world in the 1960s.
In the first half of the 1900s in the American South, African Americans suffered terribly under white mens laws.
King loved his country, but he hated these laws.
He wanted an end to the laws that were wrong.
He wanted an end to segregation in the South.
His dream was for black people and white people to live together peacefully.
All men are equal. he said.
If you ever wanna make an action movie with (uhh) five dollars for the plot and for (uhh) the props and everything
This is the movie
Phone Booth
(umm) Has good names in it, I mean theres Colin Farrell, Theres Forest Whitaker and Kiefer Sutherland (umm) good old Jack Bauers son
But, the whole story takes place inside of a phone booth
You can change the angles all you want but, come on
This is really boring
(umm) Action (stutter) movies usually have action in them
So it makes no sense to have it stand in the same spot for too long (umm) how long is it, two hours
I think its nearly two hours could be wrong on that
(umm) Basically it was just terrible
(umm) I I (stutter) would never watch this again
Theres very few movies I would say Id never watch again and this is one of them
Its up there with Mars Attacks for its annoying factor and the fact that it never moves
But I mean theres, theres (stutter) got some twists in it thats every action movie has that
(umm) Well any good one
I want to talk to you about and ultra huge no no when it comes to using humor.

The male love interest in “Another Oh Hae Young,” which aired last May, is able to see into the future
“With these abilities, the male becomes a savior of sorts to the female,” said culture critic Ha Jae-geun

Let me tell you what I believe is one of the most important things that all people should be doing in 2009 in order to fight poverty.
It is called micro-finance and micro-finance is proved to be one of the most effective tools to lift people out of extreme poverty.
And the good thing is, it can be done by everyone, actually governments, businesses, banks and every single person like you and me.
Let me explain how it works.
Think about 1.4 billion people who are living in extreme poverty in developing countries.

Maybe thats an exaggeration
But Ive Ive (stutter) watched it a lot
Ive definitely (umm) made it so this film has paid for itself over and over again
(umm) This isnt going to be a film that you can watch with your children, (umm) its probably going to be something that you can watch on a date or (umm) with friends
And (umm) on the scale of one to ten
Im sorry, on the scale of one to five I would give this a five
(umm) If it were a scale of one to ten Id give it a ten {laugh} definitely

I just felt like all the jokes were not that funny, (umm) and there were some funny parts but really not, not (stutter) really
And (umm) the acting was okay, but overall the plot was pretty bad
I just felt like we were going nowhere and basically I just really wanted it to end {laugh} so overall I would not recommend this movie
Hey, (uhh) this is a review of Are We Done Yet which is a (uhh) (uhh) abysmal movie starring (uhh) ice cube
It was (uhh) it was a pain to sit through really it was it was kinda a mystery that it was was made you know
There was probably a lot better movies that get passed up but this somehow made it
(umm) It feels like about half a movie shouldve been cut which would be kinda a short film but (uhh) probably wouldve been easy to sit through
(uhh) The trailer was pretty funny but (uhh) dont be misled
It was it was terrible

Diversity and Inclusion (also known as  D&amp;I) are critical components to the  success of NASAs missions in the 21st Century.
In order to remain competitive in a global economy  we need a wide variety of  perspectives, education levels, skills, talents, life experiences and backgrounds.
In this section you will find how NASA is working to weave D&amp;I into the fabric of its  culture, and how we are seeking to utilize D&amp;I  to maximize the individual potentials of  our workforce.
Here is where you will learn more about  NASAs strategic framework for D&amp;I,  beginning with how the Agency defines these important concepts.
This section discusses the background and evolution of D&amp;I, from its roots in the  civil rights era of the 1960s to the business imperative that it has become today.
You can learn more about how that business imperative translates at NASA.
For example, we need diverse points of view to come up with the best technical  solutions.
We also need to look externally, to how we are perceived by an ever more diverse  American public, for whom the Space Program must remain vital.
This section will also familiarize you with the six principles on which NASA�s D&amp;I  Framework is built.
You will learn about how the Agency leadership has rededicated itself to D&amp;I through the  Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Partnership.
Hello everyone, and welcome to michelfalcon
com, a customer experience video blog to grow your profits and people
Im Michel Falcon, and this is episode number one
In this episode, Im going to tell you the difference between customer experience, customer service, and customer centricity
Ill see you in a moment
A question that Im asked very frequently is, what is the difference between customer experience, customer service, and customer centricity? Lets start off by explaining what customer experience is: customer experience is a collection of events that your customers experience or goes through when doing business with you from beginning to end
Lets take going to the movie theaters as an example
If you want to go see a movie, the experience often goes like this
You jump online; you select the movie that you want to see at the right location, at the right time
When you arrive at the theater, you purchase your ticket through an employee, or perhaps theres a self-serve option
You have your ticket validated
Then you move on perhaps to the bathroom or the concession stand, move into the theater, watch your movie, and then you leave
Every single one of those events makes up the entire customer experience
Each one of those events can also be known as a customer touch point, and the entire customer experience can also be known as a customer corridor
Now, that employee that sold you that bag of popcorn was giving you customer service
Customer service is simply an action within the entire customer experience
Organizations who are known for delivering an amazing customer experience from beginning to end ensure that their customer service at every single touch point is exceptional
Customer centricity is a belief
It is a belief that an organization operates behind the viewpoint of the customer
Let me give you an example
Have you ever been in a meeting where a colleague has said, I think we should be doing this
 And then the next colleague says, No, I think we should be doing this
 Those are signs of an organization that is not customer centric because their internal people, their employees, are speaking on behalf of the customer
A customer-centric organization speaks like this: Our customers are telling us we need to do more of this or less of that
Lets build the right strategies or programs to increase customer loyalty, and lets take what our customers are saying and include their feedback
That is how a customer-centric organization operates
If you dont believe in the customer-centric model, lets take a look at Amazon
Amazon is a company that is a hundred-billion-dollar market capitalization
Their slogan, their mantra is to be the worlds most customer-centric company
Now, youre not gonna debate the financial success of Amazon with me, are you? Thank you so much for watching this episode

MR TONER: Today that the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia convicted Radovan Karadzic of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.
With the trial chamber’s conviction, we move one step closer to closing another painful chapter in the story of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.
This is Patrick Munro, financial adviser, remarking on our home equity lines of credit being lowered.
My hope for the Promise Neighborhood Initiative is that we are able to pull together the key opportunities that all young people need in order to grow up healthy, happily, put together a life where they can really contribute and give back to their community.
And there have been lots of people that have been working on providing those kinds of opportunities in our Promise Neighborhood area for many years.
I think this is really a chance for us to go beyond a bunch of silos, a bunch of individual efforts, and really link together the Promise Neighborhood area into one concerted effort where folks dont fall through the cracks at different places, where you can start with young people in their pre-school age and follow them through with really good strong programming opportunities all the way to adulthood.
And the folks that are doing those things are working together as partners, holding each other accountable for results and outcomes and when they do that ultimately kids are not going to be getting a little of something over here, a little something over here, a little something over here, nothing during this period of their lives, but rather for all 7,000 kids that are in the Promise Neighborhood area that they are going to get something consistent that they need to be the adults that we want all our children to be.
So that is what I hope will come out of the Promise nNeighborhood and its not going to be something thats going to happen in the first six months or the first year, maybe not even the first six years, its going to be something we keep working on over time.
Hi guys.
This is Alex Cordonnier.
This is a quick demo of my DMX project.
The goal of the project is to run theater lights from my TI-84. For more details, click the link in the description.
Ive been working on the project in bits and pieces over the last year, and I demonstrated it at Engineering Open House this March with a stripped down version of the firmware.
Recently, Ive been fixing a lot of bugs with it and reducing memory usage to get everything working.
Its at a point now where I have it working smoothly, so I want to demonstrate how the calculator talks to the Arduino.
Right now, the calculator is hooked up to an Arduino inside the black enclosure using a link cable for communication and a USB cable for power.
Notice that the Arduino is going to be powered by the calculator, not a computer.
The program will basically turn on USB power to the Arduino, send some commands, and then turn off power.
So Ill run it here.
sector, and a more growth-promoting sector
In the case of Mozambique, its a country thats rich in mineral resources
They have received, been blessed by a substantial amount of investment in the mineral sector
But so are other countries that are struggling to overcome conflict

The Congo receives huge amounts of investments in the mineral sector
But because its still lacking the institutional basis, the institutional framework for managing the natural resources, you do not see the benefits in terms of development
PERIES: Leonce, thats a very important point
Hey were talking about listening.
Good morning!
Sherry McCormack here with your quick tip on how to optimize your online presence.
This is financial Advisor, Patrick Munro talking about which is better, 401k or IRA.
Actually, its a misnomer because both of those alphabet soup of retirement planning, 401k and IRA are achieving the same goal.
According to a report by KPMG, more European oil refineries could have to close, with only the leaner, more efficient plants having any chance of survival.‘The Future of the European Refining Industry, considers the various challenges facing the sector and the need for action now.
The report coincides with growing concerns about the future of the Coryton refinery in Essex.

Hi Im Dan Marskell.
Currently studying a Diploma of Event Management.
Ivy College has been pretty helpful in the support department so when it comes to getting stuck on an assignment or if youre working late and you need some help theyre always there to help.
A new report from Deloitte says invest in water management, productivity enhancement and technology optimization in the oil sands to build Canadas industrial future.

curry on me and then it happened, in 2004 I landed in New York, and the first thing I realized was reality is the bitch
The first person to greet me was Indian The immigration officer was Indian customs officer eating his lunch was Indian
He made me throw all the food my mom had packed for my survival
Fuckin hypocrite i had not seen as many Indians in New Delhi as I saw in New York Subway, Dunkin Donuts, Hudson news, Hudson Deli
everywhere You know what you guys should try
MIKE MURPHY: A good example of a company thats leveraged cross platform with Facebook as part of that is Vitamin Water.
Digital will certainly play a role in how shoppers shop over the next five years.
And its work Ive been doing in this sector since my late teens
But you know what, about a year and a half ago I was at a concert for a guy that I knew from high school
And it was cool because a lot of guys from the neighborhood were there and there were a lot of young people that had gone through a youth program that I led in my teens there
It was a program called Oasis
It was a summer recreation program
The young people did basketball, games, water fights
You know, youth recreation
It was cool, it was important, but I didnt think it was a huge impact
And as I was standing around one of the young men came to me and said Hey Kofi how you doing
 And gave me props, pulled me into that you know, man hug we do without fully hugging
Steve Grove: Hey, YouTube.
You may have noticed that the Congress has come to YouTube.
You can find your Senator or Representitives YouTube channel at youtube.com/househub or youtube.com/SenateHub.
Were really excited about it and we wanna know how you think Congress can use YouTube best.
So were asking you this question: What is the number one way that the U.S.
Congress can use YouTube to make your government better?
Well, it certainly isnt evidence FOR your claim
At best, it means we should withhold judgement
But not only that, sometimes absence of evidence IS evidence of absence if we look where the evidence should be and it isnt there
It also tries to avoid the unlikelihood of their premise, or at least, the superior likelihood of alternatives
Lets say its 1947 and youre in the town of Roswell, New Mexico
You see something fall from the sky
You run to check it out
But before you get there, lots of military guys pull up in jeeps and grab you and take you away somewhere
So now youre at the table with the light over it, and theyre asking you questions about what you saw and how much you know
Once theyre satisfied youve told them everything, they let you go, but warn you that if you talk to anyone about it youll be arrested or even killed
hello class, Im James and I dont know about you but the subtitle thing took me forever to figure out, just had to say that.
Being that we are in week 3 and not to much to reflect on in the textbook I went with rituals of communication.
I believe that life is full of algorithms, patterns and history constantly repeating itself before last week I had never really applied that to communication and that was pretty enlightening.
I have applied it to behaviors tho, the best example I could give you is Adam in the garden because more often than not when you catch someone doing wrong the first thing they try to do is hide, the second thing is too use the proverbial fig leaf and try to cover it up and when all else fails they blame someone else, I think its pretty scary how ritualistic we all really are.
To me, the exciting part is figuring out this whole new world of social media, but not just social media in, I think, its current form of Twitter and Facebook and blogging, but adding the kind of GPS technology to that.
So whether it’s a Four Square or Gowalla or tons of other people I’m sure are gonna be in that space.
So what that allows me to do is, right now if I have a Facebook conversation, you could be in Shanghai, China, you could be in Detroit, Michigan, you could be in Texas.
You’re really not my consumer here, let’s say in Texas.
I want to talk to the people in Texas.



And so, lets, you know
I didnt get a specific question, but lets look at just like one example of something that a person who is an Atheist might have an issue with

Greetings fellow stamp collectors! Welcome to the Monday Morning Brief for November 21
On October 29, the American Philatelic Research Library in Bellefonte, Pa
, officially opened its doors to the world
This splendid facility is housed in the American Philatelic Center, which also is home to the American Philatelic Society
The day before this important event, the APC played host to another gathering of consequence: the Summit on the Future of Philately
Included among the more than 30 participants were representatives from the APS and APRL, the American Stamp Dealers Association, the Boston 2026 World Stamp Show, the National Postal Museum, the Royal Philatelic Society London, and the U

Postal Service, among others
As Linn’s associate editor Michael Baadke reports in our November 28 issue, attendees “enthusiastically discussed the topics of growing the hobby, the future of stamp shows, and dealers and philatelic partnerships, along with ways the leading organizations involved in the stamp hobby can work together to make it succeed and grow
” Throughout the discussion, which often took the form of a brainstorming session, Scott English, executive director of the APS, guided the conversation with his own upbeat observations regarding the state of our beloved hobby
He was quick to point out that the hobby itself is doing well, while organized philately — which includes stamp shows, the APS and other hobby groups — presents what he called “a different story
” An action plan put together by summit attendees called for a presentation at the next APS winter show, to be held March 3-5 in Reno, Nevada
If you wish to offer your own ideas and suggestions for consideration, please send them via email to future@stamps

Finally, as we head into the festive Thanksgiving holiday, I encourage you to be safe during your travels and cherish the time you spend with family and friends
Those connections are the ones that matter most of all
MR TONER: The United States is concerned about the political environment in Equatorial Guinea both before and after its April 24th presidential election.
There’ve been numerous credible reports of government security services using excessive force, obstructing and dispersing opposition rallies, and intimidating civil society activists.
and then to overview the commissioning process for each of the 31 PHNs
Frank will co-lead it with Peggy Brown from the Mental Health Commission, there will be representatives from PHNs but, in particular, from throughout the mental health sector - and this will take the form of redoing the guidelines but then overviewing each of the 31 PHNs - doing intensive work on their individual commissioning to make sure, wherever possible, we are building on existing services rather than simply creating or destroying and recreating, and that, I think, is a very important initiative
Hi, I am Amale Andary from abadieh,  I got introduced to the women in technology program through a relative, and there were also advertising in my village.
I joined this program because I used to be a university student,  but I gave up my studies because I got married; hence, this program allowed me to get back in the technology field  and improve myself  and open new horizons for me  despite the fact that I am married and have kids.
Now I have the opportunity to pursue knowledge acquisition and I have the motivation to join the work field even if from my home because now I have the tools to be able to work from home.
&gt;&gt; As for the question whether India can become a superpower -- its a great question.
Theres, I mean, political, particularly for consumer-wise, in the economy development, I think I prefer the latter.
In that sense, I think the eyes are on to[INAUDIBLE] directed towards a India as a market with enormous potential.
ANDY MURRAY: If you look at the innovation advertising, I really like what Levis is doing.
Theyre doing some really fun stuff with pop-up stores, and how theyre integrating the brand into workshops.
I have a confession to make
Im a business professor whose ambition has been to help people learn to lead
But recently, Ive discovered that what many of us think of as great leadership does not work when it comes to leading innovation

I use the methods of anthropology to understand the questions in which Im interested
So along with three co-conspirators, I spent nearly a decade observing up close and personal exceptional leaders of innovation
We studied 16 men and women, located in seven countries across the globe, working in 12 different industries
In total, we spent hundreds of hours on the ground, on-site, watching these leaders in action
We ended up with pages and pages and pages of field notes that we analyzed and looked for patterns in what our leaders did
Hello this is Andrew Young and this is part four of my video series on the Rio Olympics.

Uh, now, you might be thinking, Trevor, I recognize the name Mnuchin, but not from tax news
 Well, maybe its because last month he tried to get you to pay for his honeymoon

There was a study done that shows 80 percent of your pitching velocity comes from hip to shoulder separation
But before we get into that lets talk about the arm path and hand separation ok
Your hands want to separate down low here and you want to break them at an angle 45 degrees or more
So if Im pitching straight to you and I break my hands, I want to be 45 degrees, not straight to you, 45 degrees or more closed ok because this puts me in a good spot and the back arm is going to be the same back this way not straight back were going back this way ok
Because if I do that, that puts me into a good spot when I get into my thoracic extension or scap load

One of the things that were getting asked a lot now is what is programmatic advertising?
Its something thats a big buzz out there in the advertising world.
Were doing a lot of them and are pretty excited about it, so Im happy to explain it to you.
My name is Julie Asti Im a Certified Financial Planner with Asti Financial Management, and Im going to talk today about how to set up a Trust.
Before I talk about how to set up a Trust, its important to know that there are two different types of really common state planning documents.
Theres a living will and theres also a Living Trust.
A living will is a document that comes in to action in a sense, upon your death.
This is Ron Paul with your weekly update for Faced with continuing economic decline and an impending election, the administration, predictably, is entertaining the idea of another stimulus package.
To explain why the last one didnt work, adherents to the Keynesian economic philosophy are claiming that they actually did work – it just looks like they didnt because we dont realize how much worse off we would be right now without trillions of dollars of public spending.
The last administration bought into Keynesianism just as much as this one does, unfortunately.
Until we have leaders who understand that debt is not the way to prosperity, there will be no stopping runaway government spending.
While it is nice to hear about business tax breaks, the positive results of these tax cuts will be dwarfed by its negative effects.
First of all, $200 billion or so in temporary tax cuts and credits to businesses are nothing compared to the $3.8 trillion in tax hikes that will hit the economy like a ton of bricks on January 1, 2011 if the Bush tax cuts are not extended by Congress.
Second of all, businesses are reluctant to hire and invest, not because they are looking for temporary credits, but because of future uncertainty; they simply dont know what the government is going to do next and how future government policies will affect decisions they make now.
What new costs and regulations will be placed on them with healthcare reform and financial services reform?
Will Congress convene a lame-duck session this winter to pass cap-and-trade and other destructive legislation?
What will the cost of compliance be for hiring new employees, and will that force them to simply lay off anyone they hire now?
Worse, will the government come up with fines or additional costs if businesses have to lay people off in the future?
Right now, the safest thing for businesses to do is nothing.
Until we regain respect for the rule of law and remove some of this uncertainty, Im afraid none of these temporary promises, made right before an election, will do much towards any economic improvement.
The other glaring problem with this proposed stimulus package is that it couples tax cuts with spending increases, which makes no sense when we are already heavily indebted to foreign countries.
We should be cutting taxes and slashing government spending dramatically.
The private sector simply cannot bear the burden of our engorged public sector.
In fact, one reason earlier stimulus programs did not result in any private sector growth is because large amounts went to the public sector.
Indeed, the spending that the administration is now proposing arguably constitutes a bailout of the public sector and various union allies of the administration.
This administration is falling into the same dangerous trap we fell into during the Great Depression, as did the Germans leading into their hyperinflation of the 1920s.
Innovation in marketing means understanding what the customer wants and delivering it as quickly as possible.
We dont have a grey parrot here today but this little conure here has been taught to talk, can talk when he wants to.
And you would teach a grey parrot to talk by having them to where you can have their complete attention where theyre not distracted.
And repeat the same phrase.
When the bird acts like its trying to say it or trying to cooperate, you would use a clicker, then give them their treat and tell the bird it was a good bird.
until she slid the red button, the cute doggie popped out, and she squealed with delight
So: three toddlers with identical plastic toys, but with very different reactions to failure
The first two toddlers were perfectly capable of sliding a red button
The only thing that prevented them from succeeding was that their mind tricked them into believing they could not
Now, adults get tricked this way as well, all the time
In fact, we all have a default set of feelings and beliefs that gets triggered whenever we encounter frustrations and setbacks
Are you aware of how your mind reacts to failure
And once her powers sort of reveal themselves to the rest of her family, they realize that she might actually be the most powerful witch thats ever shown up in multiple generations
The problem is is that Alex doesnt like magic
Shes had a lot of really bad experiences with her family, people who have died because of their magic, people who have just like left them because of their magic
So she doesnt want it and she wants to do whatever she can to get rid of it
In this section were going to discuss some methods you can use in dealing with tough customers.
Im Pamela Unruh on behalf of Expert Village.
A very important thing to remember when you are dealing with a tough customer and this is a very difficult thing to do, stay calm.
something they take very seriously and that really set her apart from the rest of the group
What you really want to do is keep your answers about them and how well the two of you can work together
Make sure you do research on the company before you go in for the interview
Take a look around at their website and see if they won any awards maybe for how they treat their employees or how they treat their customers
These are things you can mention specifically when answering that question that can really show that you take your job search seriously and really want this job Ive been a fan of Build-A-Bear for years now and I think this is a great place for me to put my customer service skills to work In fact, I saw on your website that you won an award for being a great place to work and every time Ive been in there Ive seen how happy your employees were
I would love to join the team
So the three things to answer this question really well are: First, talk about how much you admire the company
Second, talk about what a great fit you would be in this position

Hi, this is Laura Turner, and today Im going to talk with you about how to write a retail resume.
What youre going to want to do first of course is you have lots of retail experience youre going to want to put your most recent and most impressive experience first.
And specifically the experience that you have in retail jobs and really, just make sure that you get everything down there as far as what your responsibilities were in that particular store.
So not only list your position in the store, but also everything that you did with the store.
You know, did you perform audits, did you take out deposits.
Say a couple of the key trends that we’re seeing in marketing for education space has been pretty much what a lot of people are trying to do, which is experimentation and experimentation and mediums that are not necessarily proven.
And so for example if we looked at social media, things like Twitter, you know, how do we measure a return on our investment if it’s not necessarily directly related to lead generation activities, which is very common for the education space on line.
So it’s-- experimentation is really a big one.
The second one is just staying above the noise.
I mean our target audience, which is young adults, you know, primary 18 to 24 year olds, you know, they’re interacting with quite a few mediums all at the same time, you know?
When you are buying an investment property and youre looking for a mortgage its important to know whether or not lenders will take rental income into account.
Rental income if taking into account, can add to your serviceability of that property significantly.
Youre renting a property for four hundred or five hundred dollars per week then youre looking at about twenty-five thousand dollars per year almost that you are adding in serviceability if the lender will take that into account.
So will lenders take rental income into account?
The answer is yes, some lenders will take rental income into account.
Im sure there are some lenders out there who won�t touch it and who wont take it into account but in most circumstances lenders will take a portion of rental income into account.
Theres one lender at the moment which I think is just Bankwest who dont take rental income into account, they take rental yield into account.
So that will just give you an average rental yield of maybe 3 or 4 %, something pretty low and theyll just say �we dont care what the property is renting for were going to say its going to for the 3 % yield and here is what will allocate to you.
So they do that but most other people will look at the rent and will take either a portion or the full amount.
I first heard about Sudan when I was in the cafeteria with a few of my friends at Swarthmore College, and there was a newspaper and there was an article about Darfur.
And it was talking about the violence and how there was great concern that there were mass atrocities and potential genocide.
We say, What can we do?
Were average Americans here in a cafeteria.
The scale and pace of change is, I recognise, large and comparatively fast and Im aware that there are challenges as the reforms are being rolled out

We are a very agile government and if you can help us improve programs or policies, well do so

If anyone wants to follow Jesus, they have to separate themselves from Christians who are in sin.
There is NO WAY you can be in right relationship with Jesus AND have other lovers.
Unless you COME OUT from those relationships and be separate, and be holy before Jesus, you will NOT be pure and right with Jesus, but you will be associated with their sin.
You must come out and be separate, start following Jesus and get into an exclusive relationship with Him.
Alright, so lets talk for a minute about tips on becoming a motivational speaker.
I think again as I said before that I still am becoming a motivational speaker and Im always watching others and Im seeing how they command a room.
And what comes out of their mouth and how does it comes out of their mouth, but I think step one in becoming one again I had spoken about it earlier that you have to have a desire that exceeds your, your obstacles that are in your way.
Now if your always, no matter what youve set out to do there are going to be obstacles that keep you from doing it, certainly thats the case for being a motivational speaker.
And I think that I dont personally let any of the obstacles get in my way.
I keep finding ways to get around them.
And Id say that probably your biggest tip first as I said is desire and commitment to do it no matter what.
All right, Im still talking about spontaneity, but what I want to talk about now is your audience and your audiences perception of whether you are being spontaneous or not.

My name is Christine Marquette and Im a registered and licensed dietitian with the Austin Regional Clinic and Im going to talk to you about how long a person can live without water.
This is actually very dependent on two things: weather conditions, and the persons percentage of body fat.
The more body fat a person has, the less bodied water that they have, so if somebody has a very high percentage of body fat, theyre actually going to become dehydrated much more quickly than somebody that has a higher percentage of body water.
As far as these conditions, the climate also has a huge impact.

First of all, arbitration is not to be confused with mediation.
Overcoming rejections from investors is something all entrepreneurs do.
Google, LinkedIn, all those founders got rejected dozens and dozens of times before they got their first investment.
So if you get rejected, good news!
These critics argue that the welfare state breeds dependence and incompetence among those who receive it
They argue that it creates social pathologies such as single parent families, excess fertility, and laziness
Some argue that people who receive welfare benefits cannot spend their benefits rationally
And so people who take on this kind of argument will argue that, you know, certain expenditures in food stamps, for example, soda or ice cream, things like that should not be purchased using food stamps because theyre unhealthy
I think the whole question that Anita was asking is about chance and how we can assure that girls like Anita and many, many, many other girls in developing countries would have the chance.
More access to education and making their lives better and therefore the whole economy better as well as reducing poverty.
Providing that chance means partly breaking down cultural values and traditions about the fact that girls are measured in terms of their success in life by getting married and having children.
Girls need to have access to education.
They need to be able to continue their education.
Hi there, Eric Bakker, naturopath with another frequently asked question regarding Candida yeast infections.
Is it better to see a doctor for a yeast infection or to get over-the-counter medications?
Thats a good question.
That really depends on how chronic or severe your condition is and whether youve had it before, if its recurring, if its acute, there are many considerations here.
If its acute and you havent really had it before, you can try some home remedies or some over-the-counter treatments.
If its chronic and recurring, youre best to get checked out and make sure that you get a resolution of this problem before it gets out of hand.
You dont want to have a chronic condition recurring, try home treatment, and just drive it further into the body.
Ive seen many women with acute thrush issues, home treat, go to the doctor, get chronic treatment, then go back and home treat and end up with conditions like endometriosis, which I find quite often linked up with chronic recurring thrush.
So you can treat at home, but if theres no resolution, you need to get checked out and a proper diagnosis before you can consider proper treatment.

Buyelwa: Im not confident that the global economics will recover in 2009. Especially given that the process of the problem is still unfolding.

Hey guys, Patricia Sweeney with SnagALife.com here, and I get a question a lot.

My name is Julie Asti, Im a Certified Financial Planner with Asti Financial Management and today Im going to be talking about how to consolidate your debts.
If youre looking to consolidate your debts, by definition that means that youre looking to put all of your debts together into one loan so that you can only make one payment rather than having to deal with multiple payments and multiple loans.
So rather than focusing on actually paying down the debts, youre going to want to make sure that you accumulate all the debts at one place.
When we talk to employers, theyre telling us they pretty much expect our students to have the technical skills, and, if they dont, companies have their own universities and their own training programs to bring our students and new grads up to speed
Whats lacking? Communication skills
They ask employers the most important skills theyre seeking in new hires, and communication is number one every year since 1982 and its evolved
Now its about storytelling
They need people who can convey data, they need people who can tell stories mainly because we are inundated with information, with the emails, you get the radio going, a podcast is going, to videos going
How in the world do you cut through? How does our student cut through? They cut through by being a great storyteller
The key to a -- to a great communicator is understanding the audience, of being very audience-centered
So few people do that
Its about one percent of the people out there do it, and thats what makes them so great
They get the audience and so theyre situational communicators
They dont talk to the grandmother the way they would talk in a sales pitch, for example, or the way they talk to the mechanic whos fixing their car, and so first of all understanding the audience is number one
You know, back in the day, in TV -- if you watch local TV -- and the lead of the story would be the who, what, where, when, why, and how
You know, the White House says today oil prices may increase over the next quarter
Okay now, instead we hook the audience, and the lead is you may be paying more at the gas pump next month
Thats how we hook them and thats what storytellers have to do
Understand the audience and make the story compelling by hooking them
First thing we do is explain: its the message, its not the medium
I think sometimes people get really caught up in that
They think oh Ive got to do my LinkedIn video, Ive got to do something on Twitter, I have to do a class presentation
The main thing to understand is what is the story you want to tell? First get the elements of that, refine that
Get that to where youre not only hooking the the audience but really engaging with them and then focus on -- on the medium thats really the first step we do, but we take them through a process of writing out what it is you want to say and how you make it more compelling
There are just steps and whether its a personal story, corporate story, group story, that formula it can really work and after we run them through that a few times then they start to get it
But we also show some examples
There are some fantastic examples of great storytelling out there
My favorite is Dollar Shave Club
I just go to YouTube and check out the Dollar Shave Club video made for four thousand dollars and look where -- look where its gone, but there are many out there that are really compelling so we show them those, run them through the formula
You put the two together and theyre able to go to put together a pretty good story
Like good communication, stories are situational so we definitely use a lot of different media
We do a weekly podcast over at the business school where we interview CEOs and business leaders
We actually pull some of those out and say were having you listen to this -- not actually what hes talking about earnings -- but how he tells the story about earnings and theyre in awe, Wow, that is -- that is so compelling and what they see is a great communicator and a great storyteller stands above all the rest, but we also show them video
Thats a very different concept if youre going to have the video elements, face-to-face, standing up in front of a group
WE CAN PROVE IT
DAN: THIS DEMONSTRATION IS PART OF THE THREE-YEAR OBSESSION OF SWEDISH BORN ELECTRONICS EXPERT MATS JARLSTROM AFTER HIS WIFE GOT A TICKET

to our Firewise program based on their success
About business resilience a lot of times I get overwhelmed because how do you reach the business community
That is a huge sector of the population and really reaching them and getting them involved has been a challenge
And one thing I heard today is think about businesses that you really need to stay open during and after a wildfire
Think about your grocery stores, your fuel fueling stations, your hospitals, things like that really your whole community relies on
Engage those people first, really prioritize and start from there
My name is Najla abou hamzeh, I am 62 years old and mother of 2 kids.
I knew about the women in technology program and it attracted me a lot because I work for Women’s cause since 30 years and I want to increase my knowledge:  for me the more a woman learns the better In addition, I would like to thank the organizations that offered us such a valuable program: Women in Technology program, Abadieh scouts center, MEPI, Microsoft and IIE.
For me they offer a valuable opportunity for every woman it opens her horizons in all fields  societal and financial ones.
Now she can let the whole world know what she thinks and does she can share her opinions and make her voice count.
Q: Tell us about your experience?
I didn’t know anything about computers and I had a friend in Sweden who contacted me asking for my help  because they are doing a handcrafts exhibition and they know that abadieh is very rich in this area.
I asked help from my son Houssam Bou Hamzeh  because I did not know anything about internet  and I asked him to take pictures of the handcraft work of many women in abadieh.
I took this very seriously because I am a militant for women’s rights and I like to improve every woman’s financial situation.
Little Triggers at the top are the same colors as the D-Pad as you see those right there And I made the buttons black with white to make those pop a little bit that having the traditional colors That are on there and then on the back I made this all black, and then this is rubber right here - ooh that feels good
Well one of the things our office did right as we started was to do a lot of research with historians outside of government who could talk to us about the timeline of American presidents’ diplomacy, Islam, where along the trajectory are we seeing presidents talk about the importance of Islam in America and how does that fit it.
And it is important to understand the American narrative as a whole, to understand the different immigrant groups that have come in, the different religious groups that have come in and how it has made our nation powerful, why it is and how it is Americans celebrate diversity.
Why is pluralism important to us?
Why freedom of expression is important to us?
Why is it that in American in 2012 synagogues and mosques and churches are side by side?
And why it is in America that we honor and respect the right of our citizens to dress as they wish in any way that they wish so that a Jew can wear a yarmulke or a Sikh can wear a turban, or a Muslim could wear a headscarf or anybody can dress in any way that they want.
You go back to the founding fathers, you go back to the founding documents of our country, and over the course of this work that we have done on developing this timeline, we’ve seen our founding fathers, from George Washington up until our current president, have inserted the importance of many religions in America, who have talked specifically about the role of Islam in America, who have understood that Islam came to America with the slaves and has been part of our country since the very beginning, which is why you can look at the experiment that is America, with every nation on earth represented in this country, and see the diversity of Islam in America.
Hi, this is Michael Niren, immigration lawyer and founder of visaplace.com.
This award is very important for the city of Kragujevac, especially because the city showed support for those organizations of the civil society that in a very concrete way supports the Roma population.
The project took on the task to empower the Roma families, or to be precise the population of children up to the age of five.
This is very important for the Roma community because empowering the families that are the foundation of society helps you get better results for the future and specifically their inclusion in the system itself.
The project mainly supports mothers who were engaged in the system and thereby received support from all civic institutions, ambulance, hospitals, police administration and educational institutions, which also cooperated in the project.
They also showed that the intersectional collaboration is very important and therefore the project was set apart from the other projects and made the representative of the Roma community really feel the benefits of the project.
Hey! 4-H Congress is almost here
That means there will be a new batch of State officers ready to come and take the reins
Watch out for the State officers that are going to be running
Not that running! But there will be campaign booths, question and answer and skits and speeches
Were going to build a clover
Its going to be huge! 4-H Congress will be here july 16 through 19
the fact that they are all the same those barriers have just been lifted and they feel fearless
Its quite amazing to see the self-confidence that they build throughout the week

And we do think its a unique place because this is the only place where they find friends who are just like them
Do you like it that there are other kids who are deaf here
&gt;&gt; Yes, I believe its very possible for India to become a superpower.
Its a tough trajectory, but I think you have a lot of advantages.
Number one, you have a population of young people coming up which everybody knows is going to be the heart of the energy of the country and of innovation in the country.
In early 2010, relator, Frank Smith approached my prior firm with another lawsuit and at that time, he also raised concerns about an issue that was happening in his work and something that was happening at Astellas, the pharmaceutical company for which he worked.
Particularly, he was a sales representative for this company and he was selling a drug, Mycamine, that was not FDA approved for use in children.
What he was instructed to do by the company was sell the drug to childrens hospitals, specifically for use in pediatric patients, something that was not FDA approved.
The company instructed the relator and other sales representatives to hand pediatric studies out to doctors to support use of the drug in children, however, at the same time the company never sought FDA approval for use in children.
So the company wanted it both ways.
The company wanted to....Astellas wanted to increase sales by promoting this drug for use in pediatric patients, but not spend the money to do the adequate studies to make sure that use in kids was safe.
A lot of times, when a whistleblower comes forward with information, like the relator did in this case, hes, you know, policing the industry.
Some companies, Astellas in this case, was arming its sales representatives with a calculator to go in and show hospital administrators how much money they would save by buying this particular drug over its competitor that was pricier, but did have an FDA approval for use in children.
Thats pretty egregious.
The first and most obvious of all of the pricing strategies, is simply to have a paid apper game.
This generally appears like its going to be a minimum amount of revenue that youll obtain, but the outcome isnt always as clear.
When youre deciding to do a paid app or a paid game, make sure that the quality is extremely high because people are going to expect this for this type of an app.
If youre just testing out your MVP, the minimum viable product, and you dont necessarily know where it lies on the quality spectrum.
Then you might want to choose a different modulation method.
With choosing a paid method, so this is outright paid, its best to look at all of the different types of similarly paid apps or games to determine the best pricing strategy.
This might vary from country to country or from time of year.
For instance, if you want to get a lot of users very quickly and youre not too worried about the return during the holidays, you might want to lower a price point.
If its during the summer and you dont really see like a huge rush, maybe its a better idea to price it a bit more.
Of course, having a paid app or game doesnt mean that you also cant have IAPs.
our engagement and wedding
Husband took me to the Nutcracker ballet
We were all decked out—me in a long red strapless dress, him in a crisp black tuxedo
He took me up on stage after the show, where everybody could see us, which is actually the worst thing you could do to an introvert like me, but I didn’t care quite as much once he got down on one knee and popped the question
I could hear people in the audience saying “What did she say
” Husband must have raised his fist in a victory pump, because people started clapping and hooting
It was a great memory that brings a smile to our boys’ faces
MATTHEW SHADBOLT: Buying a home is one of the most stressful things you could ever do in your lift either financially, personally, professionally.
Im not exactly sure why I became a financial adviser.
I think it has to be, you know, it’s not about usage.
We know, I mean I think it-- you know, just our gut feeling is we know executives are using it and there is research to verify that.
But I think our biggest question would be more on, again, the ROI and more, you know, in depth of what is the return on investment vis-à-vis other channels?
You know, how much more effective is it?
Okay, youve practiced, youre well prepared, and you know your time.
Guess what?
Its time to get up and give the speech.
can often make the other person more understanding and less likely to have their feathers ruffled
So it almost doesn’t matter what you say in that fill-in-the-blank space
You could say something like, “Well, if you’ll excuse me, I really need to go comb my mustache


Well if youll excuse me, I told Kara I would help her set up the dessert table
” Of course, as you might have already guessed, the “Duty calls” technique does have double meaning
Need to borrow money?
Then consider Prosper.
Prosper helps a wide demographic of consumers by bringing people with money into contact with people who need money.
If youre borrower Prosper offers unsecured loans at reasonable rates, if youre an investor you can stand a make a bit of money with wise loans.
Okay, now were going to talk about the couple but not in the sense of reliving their life together.
What we want to do is talk about the inspiration that they have been.
You want to thank them for being such an inspiration.
Hello to the civics students at Marion Graham and thanks for the great question about how do we diversify our economy.
Here’s some good news: our economy in Saskatchewan is more diversified and more resilient than it ever has been.
And the evidence is this: that even despite a big downturn in the energy sector, where unfortunately two thousand jobs in Saskatchewan had been lost, our economy actually created 5,200 net new jobs because of the diversity of our economy, because of the strength in agriculture, because of the strength in manufacturing and tech and in mining.
In fact, just last week there was an announcement by a major tech firm in Saskatoon that they’re going to add 300 jobs.
We’re partnering with respect to training for those jobs to happen here in Saskatchewan, so that’s one way that we can encourage more diversification.
Hey guys.
This weeks video is going to be a little bit different.
This week is World Storytelling Day, and JenniferESL had the idea to bring together a bunch of different YouTube English teachers to tell a story.
This is your district one candidate of Oregon, Shabba Woodley.
Thank you for those who are watching this.
Thank you to those who are sharing this.
Pretty much I’m going to try to do more videos, answer more questions in video form, you know that way we can help spread the word.
Today I’m contacting you and everyone on the Facebook universe to ask for help.
Pretty much right now I’m in the process of gathering signatures.
&gt;&gt; I suppose the question can it become a superpower, is what makes a superpower?
One of the things is that the government cant create some decree that a country will become a superpower.
Good afternoon.
Im really pleased to join secretary Sebelius and Dr. Mostashari and the special guests we have to launch this hit consumer program.
As Surgeon General I had the opportunity to launch the national patient -- national prevention strategy a few months ago.
As you know the national prevention strategies tried to make us become a more healthy and fit nation.
And this particular program is one of the ways the make that national prevention strategy come to life.
With better coordinated care, improved quality and decreased errors.
We want to know -- want you to know that easy access to your own health information is very valuable to patients.
I think perhaps its a bit too simplistic to say China will save the world through this global financial crisis.
I think the global financial crisis is a situation where more than one country has to come to find a solution.
Its not one countrys burden or one country has the capability to do this.
My name is Brian Hoyer, and I am a business administration management major at UNI
My business is recycle right which has grown into Right Environmental
My name is Therese Kuster and my major was public relations at UNI
I work at Target Click powered by Mudd Advertising
The reason I really got into wanting to start my own business is because I realized the potential for working for myself
I got the idea originally I was involved with the UNI entrepreneurs organization here at UNI, and we are working on a sustainability challenge with a local business and part of that which provide curbside recycling
There was no one to provide that service at that time
There was all this recycling talk going on so I figured I could provide that service that was obviously in demand
Target Click started in the RJ McElroy student business incubator with myself and another partner
We provide a variety of online marketing solutions from our clients
It can be anything from paid search to organic search, social media and content production essentially anything that helps them improve the effectiveness up their online presence
The student business incubator at the University of Northern Iowa is a learning laboratory designed to educate and inspire student entrepreneurs
The goal of the student business incubator first and foremost is to educate them
We want to established a good, strong foundational knowledge for the students before they leave campus on how to start their own business
The student business incubator was absolutely crucial in launching our business
From you know accounting help to, providing the actual physical office space that we need, pretty much every aspect has been affected by the incubator
But more important than that I think was really the entrepreneurial spirit
All of your neighbors are entrepreneurs and if youre stuck on any issue whether specific your business or for client or just anything that youre doing you can walk down the hall and find other people whove probably been through the same thing
To be successful as an Entrepreneur you first of all you need to be passionate, you need to be willing to implement, you need to be willing to take that step forward, I also think you need to be very teachable and be willing to get advice from people when you need it
When Target Click first started Id never considered myself an entrepreneur or in fact I considered myself risk adverse which is not typically a characteristic you see entrepreneurs
So they really helped me grow and move beyond that on a personal level
They helped with everything from getting our very first LLC all the way down to negotiating the sale of our business
Everything that involves my business has been impacted in a positive way by the incubator
If something happens to me, just put me in the box
Ive already put on the outfit that Im ready to go in, OK
AMY PHAM: There is a verifiable style revolution happening at Oakland, California right now

I go, oh, OK
-Right now, I would say definitely 50s inspired
&gt;&gt; Of course role models are important for us in the Middle East.
The question is the quality of those role models and who they are.
Hi, Im Carl Kwan.
Presentation design can seem like a big mystery.
But in this four part video series, Im going to show you some basic design principles that will give your presentations a clean, professional look that will help you make a great impression and more importantly, get your message across to your audience.
And who doesnt want to do that, right?
Well, in case theres anyone who doesnt want to do that, check out my video about what a presentation is.
Okay, so what youre going to learn is CRAP: Contrast, Repetition, Alignment and Proximity.
Sue Brownsen: So I am here because I think health care, it’s a necessary right for everybody.
Alright, let me tell you something else about humor in public speaking.
It really needs to appear to be spontaneous.
And what spontaneous is, is it kind of happens in the moment.
[Kelli Williams Gary, PhD] By the summer of 1993, I had taken the prerequisites to become an occupational therapist
I was accepted into the program, and by that time I was full time, all out, no holds barred— school was intense for 2 and a half years, but I made it through, and like I said, I let my professors know that I had brain injuries
It didnt stop me, and I didnt use it as a crutch, but they definitely had some understanding and would be patient with me in some situations when I really, really needed it
So by the summer of 1995 I had finished the program
I was the president of my student OT association class, and I graduated Cum Laude from Chicago State with a 3
4 average, and with all the skills that I needed to be an occupational therapist

Even still today, there are times when its very difficult to bring all of those key stakeholders to the table, together around a cause


Alright, so there are some pros and some cons.
And again, thats an opinion thing, you can probably talk to 20 motivational speakers and get 20 different answers about the pros and cons about being a motivational speaker.
And I can tell you from my prospective, that the pros and cons are also the goods and bads if you will, or also the bads and goods.
Meaning, I enjoy travel, so one of the things about me being a motivational speaker across the United States and Canada, is I travel a lot to get there.
For instance, the day after tomorrow Im leaving to Indianapolis to teach for a day.
Which means I fly on Wednesday, teach on Thursday, come back on Friday.
And thats a quick round trip to go 2/3 of the way across the United States.
And I love that part, I love my time in the hotel room alone.
Well thats it for me.
The way that we measure the effectiveness of our advertising is to understand what the pulse of the consumer is at all times.
So we’re looking at measures in a traditional sense around what is the awareness of our brand, what is the consideration, what are the brand attributes that are being associated back with our company and how do those get built up or broken down over time when we’re active or not active in marketing.
BRUCE FALCK: Something that weve noticed lately is that firstly, people start preparing and researching for the holidays pretty early.

Deloitte recently announced it had acquired substantially all of the assets of CRG Partners.
The move was made to grow its financial restructuring, turnaround management and bankruptcy reorganization capabilities.
The move brought some immediate changes to the organizational structure that included: Deloittes Reorganization Services Group and the transferring CRG professionals will operate under the name Deloitte Corporate Restructuring Group (Deloitte CRG).

Hey, its Tracy.
Were talking about listening and I just want to give you one more really important tip before we go.
Increasing womens entrepreneurship is just plain good economics.
Its no surprise that the group of twenty world leaders have turned their focus to womens issues.
In the upcoming days, the group of twenty will be meeting in Cannes, France, not far from where we are today.

Hello everyone.
Hello everyone.
Im here to announce the winner of Round 1 of the #HartHouseWinterBlast sweepstakes which weve been doing throughout the week.
I have two people here who entered via Facebook, one on the Facebook event section and one via the Facebook wall, and I have one who entered via Twitter.
They were all randomly chosen ad were going to have my lovely assistant here choose from among these three people.
Okay now it is the moment that youve all been waiting for.
As we enter into our new year we are also entering into our new year of equipment purchases.
This year we will be purchasing over 1,500 new tractors, over 1,500 new dry van trailers and over 700 new temperature controlled trailers.
As we look at equipment, particularly tractors, we know the specifications of that equipment is very important to you.
As you rely on that equipment for your safety and your comfort as that is your workplace and your home out on the road.
So we appreciate the feedback we’ve received throughout the year from all of you.
What was life like living in an institution?
Charlie Carr, Boston, Massachusetts It was an incredibly huge shock because my disability was traumatic.
What happened to me was I had a spinal cord injury as the result of a diving accident, so I went from being a non-disabled person, not having any background or knowledge of disability, to becoming instantly paralyzed and a person with a disability.
So for me there was a huge denial factor going on that for someone who might have a congenital disability might not be as much of an issue.
I was devastated and so when I put into an institution and I went into this segregated high school I was very angry because I couldnt be with my peers at the local high school.
But when I went there and I saw all these people in wheelchairs, I just remember thinking, This isnt me. But it was me.
And so I was very freaked out by what I saw and it hit me very hard, the realization that, You are these people. What really hurt me, then, was finding out what I lost.
And what I lost was control over my life.
Ease into the school year, Im going to do a whole back to school series

If you look at the 23 billion dollar online advertising market in the US, I think there are three fundamental trends that are most important.
And not necessarily from an aggregate dollar basis, but social media is number one.
I was this kid working in Seattle and doing a play at the Empty Space theatre and Seattle was one of the stops on this... they were doing a kinda casting you know, one of those they want a classic sort of search for a new actor, a new face.
I guess there werent enough new faces in Hollywood at that time!
So anyway, they came to Seattle, this one woman came to Seattle I met her, read for her, she was impressed enough to recommend me to David.
JON TESTER: Look, I dont think its going the move the ball
I think there is another agenda here
And the agenda is to do some really bad things with Medicaid expansion and to block-grant Medicaid, which really hurts rural states -- I think it hurts the whole country -- and not to address preexisting conditions and lifetime caps
And if thats the direction were headed, then thats not the direction I want to go
I think that that skinny bill, that bait-and-switch bill, whatever you want to call it, Trojan horse repeal bill, that bill is not where we will end up at
And I dont think you get the conservatives with that bill
And I dont think you get the moderates either
Hi, Im Carmen Lynne with Expert Village and weve been talking about handwriting analysis and I hope you have realized how fascinating this whole subject is.
Its obviously a huge subject and theres a lot more to learn about it, but Ive probably given you just a little overview of all the different aspects.
The world is a much more dangerous place today than it was yesterday.
The leading international powers have bet our collective future on a deal with the foremost sponsor of international terrorism.
Theyve gambled that in ten years time, Irans terrorist regime will change while removing any incentive for it to do so.
In fact, the deal gives Iran every incentive not to change.
In the coming decade, the deal will reward Iran, the terrorist regime in Tehran, with hundreds of billions of dollars.
This cash bonanza will fuel Irans terrorism worldwide, its aggression in the region and its efforts to destroy Israel, which are ongoing.
Amazingly, this bad deal does not require Iran to cease its aggressive behavior in any way.
And just last Friday, that aggression was on display for all to see.
While the negotiators were closing the deal in Vienna, Irans supposedly moderate President chose to go to a rally in Tehran and at this rally, a frenzied mob burned American and Israeli flags and chanted Death to America, Death to Israel! Now, this didnt happen four years ago.
It happened four days ago.
Irans Supreme Leader, the Ayatollah Khamenei, said on March 21 that the deal does not limit Irans aggression in any way.
He said: Negotiations with the United States are on the nuclear issue and on nothing else. And three days ago he made that clear again.
monsters have a perpetual effect all the time
This effect is: While the monster is in play, wizards may not improve their grade
Thats not a terrible thing to happen at the beginning of the game, whereas Parakeet of Paralysis, if that gets activated, discard any two cards
And that only happens to the active wizard, not to all the players in the game
So these monsters are now the monsters you start out with roaming the halls of Wizard School
Your Parakeet of Paralysis and your School Spirit
Step 4 is your main step where you can customize the difficulty of the game and that is with graduation cards
You have freshmen level difficulty cards, you have sophomore level difficulty cards, you have junior level difficulty cards, and you have your senior year cards
The senior year cards are very, very difficult
Your freshmen year cards actually make the game a little bit easier
A useful non-digital source of information is witnesses-- finding people who have seen something going on.
They saw a co-worker acting peculiar.
Maybe they saw someone walk in the front door that they didnt recognize.
And you want to find out more about what they may have seen.
So document, talk to them, call them, write down what theyve seen, gather information about what they happen to have identified that day.
And try to get very quickly to that person.
The more time goes by, the more we tend to forget.
Theres a big difference between being an S-Corp, an LLC, and a Sole Proprietor.
I would strongly encourage you, for a variety of reasons, to strongly consider being an S-Corp.
An S-Corp gives you really substantial tax benefits.
I am not an accountant nor am I a lawyer, so this should not be construed as legal advice or tax accounting advice.
So talk to your lawyer, talk to your accountant about this.
But a Sole Proprietorship is a great way to start your business.
Its about creating something that from the beginning as youre creating it is built in a way to have multiple uses
In others words, if I capture my ideas, my thinking, my information in a proper way, I can use the same information For a speech, For a training, For mentorship, For coaching, For authoring, For facilitating
For any different modality because Ive build it right
So, you need to understand, we need to understand: How do you build that information in a way that allows me to put it out there repeatedly without necessarily having to recreate it
So, its about creating it once and delivering it often
Hi, this is Michael Niren, immigration lawyer and founder of visaplace.com.
A lot of controversy surrounding whether or not an individual who is taking the oath of Canadian citizenship should have the right to cover up their face, usually for religious purposes while taking the oath.
Well, generally speaking, I think they should have that right, however there is a concern about identity.
If you cover your face completely, will the oath taker be able to reveal themselves to the authorities, now that is obviously a concern.
I think that it is essential that anyone taking the oath of Canadian citizenship has to identify themselves to the authorities.
So the question really is, is there a way around it?
Now thats a question that could be addressed by the authorities procedurally, but if that can be overcome?
If the oath taker who is wearing a religious garb, for example an hijab, can properly identify themselves, then they should have the right to do.
Welcome to Topic One.
- One of the top questions I consistently get asked is: how do I scale my engagement across social? See, managing large communities or listening all the time, its time consuming, and weve developed so many time-saving apps and software to help us automate the process, but herein lies the distinction
Processes can be automated, but one-on-one conversations meant to relationship-build cannot
The bottom line is that meaningful one-on-one conversations require human-to-human interaction and a personal touch
Its the blending of the two thats an art form, and its always evolving
See, when you can automate in the right places, the human touch points within any campaign, product release, or general sharing system, youve hit the jackpot
And to achieve this, we use the rule of thirds to split between automation, sharing, and one-on-one interaction
This will make the difference for companies and for people
I approach it this way for myself, and a word of caution, while great tools do help us automate the process, too much automation of engagement gets us in trouble
The more complex we get with our automation systems, the harder we have to work at humanizing what we do
See, unfortunately the science of automation has taught your target audience to distrust most marketing
For instance, when youre doing e-mail triage every morning, do you question whether a particular e-mail is from a real person or is it an e-mail blast thats been personalized to you? Are you suspicious of the ads that you see are even re-targeted? Or do you stop looking at your direct messages on Twitter because all you seem to receive are automated messages? Your audience is just as sick of being bombarded with automation as you are, and in this discussion of automation, lets also consider the human error factor
Currently, there is no automated system that prevents humans from making mistakes or social errors online
And as companies, weve been used to having a little space between developing content and distributing it
But digital sharing, especially immediacy of social, has made many of us wish there were more filters in place to prevent human mistakes from coming in
So, where should we draw the line? People want us to be more human online, but part of the discomfort many companies have with embracing social business is the possibility of embarrassment due to that human error
See, some of the errors committed online by corporations have been more than just embarrassing
Theyve been career-ending
However, companies are learning to demonstrate humanity rather than knee-jerk reactions to save face
Thats a good thing
In the corporate world, theres still a little too much emphasis on appearing perfect
People are surprisingly forgiving brands when they own up to mistakes, and unfortunately some haters out there love to point fingers and jump all over imperfections, but for the most part, people understand

It IS a wonderful blessing if Jesus has spoken to you in the past, whether it be 5, 10 or since the Lord Jesus spoke to you?
DAVID ROMAN: The answer is absolutely yes, no question about it.
Hello again everyone, Beverly here once more with yet another video about binary option trading and how you can improve at it.
In my video today I want to give you a few tips on how you can trade stocks intelligently and how I like to do it.
Stocks are always popular assets on the binary option market, Personally, I think thats because of the fact that people recognize brand names and want to trade them, even if you arent trading actual stocks, you can say I traded apple stock today and made a $400 profit!, that always has a nice ring to it... As with any other asset, the first rule of trading stocks is this - dont trade what you dont know.
Uh, when I became director of OEO or, or was nominated to be director of OEO, Don said to me, You oughta have a conversation with the President. And this was, what, nineteen sixty eight... N-n-nineteen sixty nine, I guess.
Uh, we had no relations with China at the time.
I, uh... Don and I went into the Oval Office, just the three of us: the President, Don, and myself.

Thanks for tuning in
I’m Peter Robert from ACDelco and I’m here to discuss the timing belt and the importance of having it replaced as preventative maintenance
Because it is not often replaced, timing belt service is easy to overlook when your car is otherwise running well
Unfortunately, there are no warning signs or symptoms of a worn belt
It may simply break and the engine will stop running – whether you’re in your driveway or on the freeway
With some engine types, a broken timing belt could also cause severe internal engine damage that could require major engine repair or even a new engine
That’s why it’s very important to check your owner’s manual for the mandatory replacement recommendations starting as early as 40,000 miles, but may be as high as 100,000 miles
For all of you not able to do this service work yourselves, please go to acdelco
com and click on ‘find a service center’ to locate the closest ACDelco professional service center program participant
One of the advantages of going to your local ACDelco professional service center is that we offer timing belt service kits that could save you valuable time, money, and possibly prevent future engine failures
Our kits include all the component parts associated with belt service work: new pulleys, springs, tensioners and perhaps even a new water pump
Replacing these wear components when replacing the timing belt is essential to ensuring the new belt performs to its mileage requirements
Replacing these components when changing the timing belt saves money on labor in most cases, as your technician will have already removed them and other engine accessories to service the timing belt
Our kits for GM vehicles match original specifications for the belt material and supporting hardware – and our kits for other non GM vehicles meet or exceed factory specs, too
Some competitors’ kits don’t include any original-equipment components
That’s important enough for me to say it again: ACDelco timing belts are manufactured with materials and construction technology identical to the original timing belt in your vehicle
An inferior timing belt may cost less initially, but may cost more down the road if fails prematurely
Check your owner’s manual today for the recommended timing belt service – and by the way: some engines use a timing chain instead of a belt
In that case, periodic replacement isn’t necessary and there won’t be a mileage recommendation for service
If you’re unsure about your vehicle, ask a representative from your ACDelco professional service center
SECRETARY CLINTON: I’m sorry I couldn’t be there in person, but I am delighted to send best wishes to all of you as you come together to find ways to elevate the status of women.
I also want to thank the Government of Bangladesh for hosting.
Closing the gender gap is a powerful prescription for economic growth.
The evidence is clear and the debate should be over.
But all over the world, women still face enormous obstacles to starting new businesses or expanding existing ones.
Many of you have faced these barriers firsthand.

Last week\92s surprise announcement that Health Care REIT is buying Sunrise Senior Living for $14.50 per share pushed the other senior living stocks higher in anticipation of higher valuations, lower cap rates and perhaps more REIT take-outs of other companies.
One has to remember, however, that when Mark Ordan took over at Sunrise, with its shares trading below 50 cents and bankruptcy looming, a sale of the company was always on the table, as sort of an \93exit\94 strategy if he could accomplish what many thought was a near impossible task.
Plus, I was getting absolutely inundated with emails and pings on social media
People wanted me to follow up or elaborate with them on things that I talked about in the book
And it was overwhelming, I mean I couldnt do that and be on the road at the same time
So I thought, wow, a membership site could solve my problem of being on the road all of the time But it could also solve problems for people at a mass level that I couldnt do if I was speaking seven days a week, so that got me excited too
Yeah initially I was really worried, wondering if we had enough content
And Stu kept assuring me, he said, you got tons of content
You know, youve got books, youve got all this content youve done your site
But I kept thinking, oh my gosh, Im going to have to come up with this original content every single week
But that wasnt the case
What I found was that you can really repurpose the same content and its extremely rare when somebody says, oh thats just that blog post you did a while back

you can pull this off if you do it right so there are three things I want to tell you should do number one be confidence you know imagine led my team of people dont want somebody who is dad doesnt have that energy they wants a whole self to driven self-motivated so when youre telling people that you can do the job you should be confident in your own capacity number two when they ask about M&amp
All right, now lets talk about gestures, and when Im talking about gestures.
I mean the things that you do with your hands, and the things that you do with your face.
&gt;&gt; The big deal in South Dakota was passing licensure for all levels of speech- language pathology service providers all the way from assistants to you know independent practicing certified speech language pathologists.
So up until that point there was regulation for speech pathologists who were working in an education setting, and they were of course regulated by education administrators.
But through advocacy efforts and passage of the licensure bill in South Dakota, we now have speech pathologists who are regulating the practice of speech-language pathology in South Dakota, and so for us that was a huge victory.
I think its very rewarding I mean, you know, its difficult to be kept in a box for me, and also, you know, as a speech-language pathologist, communication is extremely important.
Did you know that compliments are so good that can heal your harmed relationship?
Hi, Im Hazely Lopez from Hazely Academy of Refinements and Modeling and Im here to talk about how to compliment people.
The first, of course, you want to think about sincerity.
Smurf: Okay, so I’m going to go ahead and talk about this.
Good morning, I am Adelina Vasileva and  this is the daily report from our newsroom in Varna.
The first ships from the United States Navys  biofuel-powered fleet, officially known as the Great Green Fleet,  have sailed off to deployment in  the Western Pacific.
The six ships are powered by an alternative fuel blend made of 10% biofuel  and 90% conventional petroleum fuel.
The biofuel is primarily made from beef tallow, which was provided by Midwestern farmers through a partnership with the USDA.
The deployment of the Great Green Fleet  is one of the U.S.
Navys five goals for reducing  the branchs energy and environmental footprint.
Even though the 10:90 biofuel blend,  on which the ships sailed off, is much less greener than the 50:50,  with which they were tested, this small shift towards renewable energy  is still an improvement from several years ago.

Lets use some of the creativity we talked about last week for this chapter
I want you to imagine you are really really rich and you can have anything you want to have I want you think about might be a particular car, it might be a race horse it might be a house on the beach
Think about a possession that you would like to actually own
I want you imagine maybe even close your eyes and imagine that you have that possession
How would you feel and how it would be to have that item in your life and now I want you to imagine how you would take care of that object If it was a car, for example, I know a lot of you have dream cars how would you take care of ti? Would you read the instruction manual? Would you make sure it had tune ups? Would you polish it to perfection and make sure it was always in its prime state
Maybe and those of you have children I want you to think about how hard you strive to be the best parent you can be
You try to buy healthy food and take care of that child or what about a pet? What did your pet have for breakfast this morning? This chapter is all about health and as you can see what Im trying to get to here
We know that good health is more important than anything
Its more important than that race car or that race horse or that magnificent house
People who are sick or who dont have good health would give all away to have good health and yet how well do we take care of ourselves? Do we read our instrucion manual? Well we dont come with one but do we read articles about health and how to eat well and take care of our bodies? Do we eat well do we sleep do we do all those things we know were supposed to do
In this chapter a lot of its very very familiar
You probably already know what youre supposed to do so this chapter is a reality check and a reminder that we need to take care of ourselves and that our health is our most prized possession
So 2:08review for most of you especially if youve taken the health three-unit health class which isnt required to transfer to a UC and even to transfer to a CSU you have a lot of options in that Area E but if youve taken it again this chapter will be just a good reminder
At this point in the semester its a good time to think about those things we learned about keeping our brains healthy way back in a chapter on memory
Remember was it sleep that you needed more? Or healthy vegetables? Or what is it that you need to keep your health your mind and your body healthy
So think about it this week and think about getting back on track and making sure as you get busier and busier and as finals approach that you do not dream of neglecting to take care of your most magnificent possession
This week you also get a chance to take a little test to see how long youre going to live
I got 86 so Im pretty happy with that
My current habits will get me to the grand old age of 86
Lets see how many if you can beat me and a think thats it for my intro
Getting out from liberalism belief should be the fundamental task of critical thinking today.
That’s actually one of my pet peeves.
Um when an applicant asks how much do I have to do, um, that shouldn’t sound very good to them um because anytime you’re um presenting yourself or entering a professional school you uh really should be an individual that kinda goes above and beyond the call of what you have to do or what the basics are.
Uh and that’s certainly what we’re look for in an application process is individuals that have excelled.
Um and so I know there are some programs that may require a basic number of shadowing or volunteer hours um but I really think you should do it because you’re interested in it um and you, you, you want to enhance yourself uh in order to make yourself potentially a better doctor down the road in our case.
Steven Wallace&gt;&gt; My name’s Steve Wallace, I’m the grocery, beers wines and spirits buyer for Sainsbury’s for Scotland and for Northern Ireland.
My role is to find the best products we can find in Scotland.
It’s looking for quality products that we can sell or our customers demand, it’s looking for different and exciting ideas within the marketplace.
The best part of the job, I would say, would be when you’re giving a big new contract or a new listing to, in particular, a small supplier because that’s where it means jobs.
You could list a product in 20 or 30 stores, it could mean an extra five or six jobs at that particular supplier, so that’s always a good good moment.
Your decisions in your everyday job, from seeing the quality products to listing them on your shelves, that affects jobs and communities, it goes all the way down the chain.
Sometimes you can underestimate the importance you can have to different suppliers and actually to employment, so it’s absolutely fundamental, it helps the whole Scottish food industry.
My least favourite part of the job is the administration, the spreadsheets and deadlines surrounding the job.
There are great fun parts to the job about seeing great products, great suppliers, but actually there’s a lot of time needs to be spent doing the number crunching analysis, it’s a boring part but it needs to be done, it’s all part of the job.
I think you need to have a good eye for a product, you need to be very patient, you need to be good at communicating because we have to communicate within our retail side and our head office, government bodies, all sorts of suppliers and other people, so being a key communicator is absolutely essential.
I got to this position really by working in the retail industry for a long time.
From pushing trollies in Tesco when I was 15, I’ve worked for Tesco’s, for Sainsbury’s, I went to Sainsbury’s as a trainee buyer in London about 12-13 years ago then went to work for Waitrose as a buyer, then took the opportunity to come back up to Scotland (because there aren’t many buying jobs in Scotland) three years ago.
The advice I’d give to anyone interested in a career in the food industry is to get involved with the suppliers at an early age – know your products.

Since its the dreaded back-to-school time, I decided that it would be fun to do a back-to-school school expectations versus reality video
Because I can think of a lot of things that everyones like, oh my god, this is whats going to happen during school
No, no its not true
If you can relate to any of these, give this video a thumbs up

As we discussed in the previous series, percussion and beats, as theyre more commonly referred to in the digital environment and workstations, is that beats and percussion really affect the mood of the song, even if theyre very simple or even if because theyre very simple.
Songs and other genres of music are shaped by the percussion or a lack thereof, most notably, ambient music or defined ambient by the fact that they dont have noticeable aspects to it like percussion.
If you are on Instagram you probably noticed that there has been a pretty good increase on ads lately.
That is because earlier this month Instagram began offering paid advertising opportunities through selective developer partners.
In the coming months what we will see is a self serve option for any budget much like Facebook has.
These new ad opportunities require a minimum spend.
So if you are a small business you probably wont be able to take advantage of this until later this year.

Yeah, economy may come back in 2009, maybe in 10, maybe in 11. Thats not for me the most important issue because it will come back some day, today, tomorrow, or the day after.
But the issue is come back where.
Thats my issue.
Do we go back to the same normal situation, quote unquote normal situation that we were in before the crisis?
When the crisis is over we go back to that?

Whether we acknowledge our role as a world leader in disability rights are not, other countries still look to the US for leadership on human rights issues


laws enabled me to access my fundamental rights especially in terms of having access to quality education
Im advocating for similar laws to be implemented everywhere
Education is very important in my family
My mother was the 13th child in a very poor family from Eastern Samar in the Philippines
Her father, the breadwinner, died when she was barely a year old putting the family in a dire financial position
However, despite their poverty, the family prioritize education because they believed in its power to transform lives
- Hi, its Tim Allwood from Compass Property, here today to talk to you about Equity
Whats Equity? Equity in your home is when you, well, its what you own in your home
So if you take off what your homes worth, $500,000, say, if you owe $200,000, thats equity of $300,000, okay? So its the difference between what you owe and what your house is worth, your equity
The big problem is, a lot of people leave their equity sitting at home all day doing nothing, so to speak, in the cupboard
While you go and work your butt off, and your equitys sitting there doing nothing
So what we propose you do is what most clever Australians do, is grab some of that equity, keep it secure, dont take all of it, just a good amount of it
So we use that to purchase the income-producing asset, an investment property
So what you need to be clear about is you dont have to spent all your equity, and we can actually take enough equity to make sure theres a nice buffer
So you dont, its actually no money down for your investment property, well talk about that in another video
And Ill also talk in my next video about whether you should be looking at cash flow neutral, cash flow positive, cash flow negative, and in fact, what that really does mean
The President: I want to thank His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani and the government of the State of Qatar for co-hosting this meeting, and all the countries that have joined in this important effort.
Im pleased that the United States is represented in Doha by Attorney General Eric Holder and one of my key White House advisors, Mike Froman.
During this Arab Spring weve been inspired by the courage of ordinary citizens determined to forge their own future.
As President, Ive made clear that the United States stands with those seeking their universal rights.
Ive made it our policy to support reform across the region, and assist transitions to democracy.
And at Deauville last year we joined with our G8 partners to support these transitions in the Middle East and North Africa.
That includes the economic reforms that create jobs and opportunity, boost trade and entrepreneurship, and combat corruption so that people can live in dignity.
And thats why at the G8 Summit this spring at Camp David, we called for this forum to make sure were working together to recover stolen assets that must be returned to the people of countries like Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya.
Its Monday morning.
Its 8:30. My name is Beth Durkee, and this is Marriage Standing Journal video, the complement to Marriage Standing Journal blog.
Welcome to the very first episode of Marriage Standing Journal video.
This morning in the blog I gave you some information about  the mission of Marriage Standing Journal and I told you some things about myself, the moderator.
and buying these electric vehicles, so all those lead to really good signs for this industry, as well as the renewable market is continuing to grow
So solar in a lot of parts of the world now is much cheaper than using fossil fuels, and thats because of the infrastructure needed
Now, in more developed nations like the United States where we have massive amounts of fossil fuel based infrastructure, its a lot cheaper still
However, as the rest of the world comes online and starts to develop, a lot of these technologies, renewable being one of them, is gonna be the cheaper and better option, and when that happens, the reason that matters for the EV market is because youll be able to power your vehicles using this free renewable source, whether it be wind or solar or whatever, and its not just about the consumer side where me and you have cars that we use to go to work and back
Hi this is Donnie, welcome back to Flooring My Life product reviews Today were going to give a review on Reward Hardwood Flooring First I want to go over a little of the company background of Reward Then Ill go over the design, construction, finish, maintenance, and installation of this product Reward is actually a brand of Galleher company Galleher is a large distributer here on the west coast and Reward is actually manufactured in China but they do a really good job of quality control by having employees actually employed in their China manufacture facilities The design is really what makes this product line Youre going to have a lot of species options with red oak, white oak, maple, birch, American walnut, American cherry hickory, a lot of stain colors within those species as well also some exotics
Brazilian cherry, Santos mahogany, Brazilian cherry So a lot of design options as well as a lot with the texture so youll have smooth, hand scraped, chatter marks, bleeding, a lot of different options for textures You have a lot of different things you can really do with the floor The product is made up pretty well
Its an engineered product overall Theres half inch and three eighths options in terms of thickness 1 mil, 2 mil, 3 mil wear layer depending on what actual style you go with within Reward The longevity of the product will definitely depend on how thick of a wear layer you end up purchasing Youre also going to get some good width options
Some products come with 3 and 5 some only have 3, you also have some random width lines in here where youll get 3, 5, 6 and 7 So theres a lot of different width options you can do which is really good for design Length is pretty average
Youre going to get 48 inch average length
It is random so probably a little big above average in a lot of things you see out there so nothing overly spectacular about the board length
In terms of the finish, its got a great finish, it has the aluminum oxide finish on it Its always important to keep in mind, whatever finish you buy its going to scratch So yes this hardwood will scratch but it also has a very nice 25 year warranty on the finish The product itself, the maintenance is very very easy Just like you would maintain any other hardwood floor, youre going to sweep dust mop, wipe up spills and every once in a while you can damp mop Make sure you keep felt pads under furniture, things like that Installation really has a lot of options here

A great overall purchase no matter which one you buy The price and the value always match with Reward Hardwood Flooring This is Donnie with Flooring My Life product reviews
As director of the National Institutes of Health, Im delighted with the renaming of this part of what we do...a very important part ...as Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI). And the notion that this is something  that we dont just think about now and then, but its something we think about everyday... EDI 365 ...is also a very important component of what were talking about with this new perspective.
I guess on Leap Year it would be EDI 366 but, oh well...small point.
The leadership that is in place, and about to be in place, with Deb Chew now taking on the role of creating this new version of the office and with Hanna Valantine, distinguished cardiologist coming from Stanford to be our new Chief Officer for Scientific Workforce Diversity, puts us in a place to emphasize this area of diversity and inclusion in new and creative ways.
And thats at all levels within NIH.
Everything from the senior investigators, the people working in the labs, the critical people who support all of this... administration, finances, facilities, public safety.
Hello, Im Jessie Quinn from cupsofbooks and today Im going to be reviewing A Study in Scarlet by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
[music] Because I only finished two books in February, I will not be posting Monthly Minis video.
Instead youre gonna get two separate videos that are going to have individual reviews for both books I read in February.
We have reached the point in my review where I put down whatever Im drinking and start talking about the book.
So Im gonna do that To give you the synopsis off the back because I feel it will sum it up  better than I will: [quoting] In A Study in Scarlet, Holmes and Watsons first mystery, the pair are summoned to a south London house where they find a dead man whose contorted face is a twisted mask of horror.
The body is unmarked by violence, but on the wall a mysterious word has been written in blood.
The police are baffled by the circumstances of the crime, but when Sherlock Holmes applies his brilliantly logical mind to the problem, he uncovers a tragic tale of  love and deadly revenge.
Dot dot dot.
Yes, I did just read out the punctuation.
Honestly I enjoyed A Study in Scarlet much more as a predecessor to the contemporary mystery novel than as an actual mystery novel.
A lot of the sorta hallmarks of your average mystery novel are not really in this one.
For instance, there is really no way of knowing who did it in this one until its actually revealed by Sherlock Holmes who had committed the crime.
When sherlock reveals who did it, I was sorta like, Well, I would have had no idea who that person was! One thing I didnt quite expect from this novel is that half of it is told from Dr. John Watsons perspective on whats happening with the crime and Sherlock in London and then the other half is sorta told through flashbacks that are flashbacks from other characters that are associated with the crime.
Really liked all the stuff that was told from Dr. John Watsons perspective.
I purchased a purse at a store that had a tag with a price on it and I found out later that they overcharged me what the purchase price was.
So when I argued with them and argued with my credit card company, they refused to reimburse me for the difference so I made a complaint with the Consumer Affairs.
I did it online.
And within about a month or so, I received a call from the store and they told me that they will refund me the difference.
I would tell every New Yorker that there are government agencies like the Department of Consumer Affairs that are out there and are free; that you can use to help you resolve complaints.
That you don’t have to go to a lawyer to get your issue resolved.
MR KIRBY: This morning, the State Department hosted here in D.C.
the Sixth Annual U.S.-Philippines Strategic Dialogue led by Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Danny Russel and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Amy Searight on the United States side, and on the Philippines side Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs Evan Garcia and Under Secretary for Defense Policy Pio Lorenzo Batino for the Government of the Philippines.
Both countries reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening the U.S.-Philippines alliance in terms of ensuring both countries – our mutual defense and security as well as jointly contributing to regional peace, stability, and economic prosperity.
this video were going to have a brief talk about data exchange formats and more specifically about XML and JSON and why JSON is widely replacing XML nowadays
So first of all what data exchange formats are
Data exchange formats are standards that have been developed in order for applications to serve up data and this is what we think of us an application programming interface, an api, an interface that two different applications use in order to talk to each other
For example, one might be a client that wants to talk to a web server
How do they talk to each other
By sending data back and forth in some standardized way that they both know about such as XML and JSON
XML stands for extensible markup language and JSON for javascript object notation
Well the classic 30 or 60 second TV spot is evolving and changing pretty dramatically.
I actually have a twin, so I grew up with her and always had someone with me.
Going to Denver was really hard because I had no friends or family, but I definitely learned independence through that.
And, umm after I made friends in Denver, I was able to go explore more parts of Colorado and try a lot of outdoor activities I probably wouldnt have otherwise.
Hi welcome back.
Im Charly Lang.
This lesson is titled Whose Life is it Anyway and it begins with an article a short article that I wrote in direct response to the language that I heard many of my, as I always say, more traditionally inclined therapists using with their gay identified clients continually referring to this thing called internalized homophobia.
This article really emphasizes the importance certainly from a narrative perspective of engaging externalizing conversations in our work.
The article or the lesson then goes on to identified certain what I call fluid practices that ground me in the work, along with an article documenting my work with particular clients suffering from the effects childhood sexual abuse and our work over a period of about nine months.
The Chicago School of Professional Psychology is a foremost academic institution competitive with top universities today.
During the time I have spent at TCSPP, I have found the faculty always accessible for students questions and amazingly helpful at giving students resources.
What makes TCSPP unique is that it prepares its students for a life of purpose, service, and leadership.
Graduates are ready to make a real difference in their community.
I especially appreciate the fact that faculty know their students personally.
Thank you for watching the weekly video about my work in Congress
I spoke on Monday to pay tribute to the 15th anniversary of the attacks of September 11th
Each time I speak on the House Floor I end my remarks by saying and may the President by his actions never forget September 11th and the Global War on Terrorism, because we must never forget this devastating mass murder of American families on U


I also spoke this week about how under the Presidents failed legacy on drug policies, addiction rates and overdose deaths of opioids has increased dramatically
Sadly this Administrations reactions to the public health crisis are too little too late
Im grateful that Congress acted to address the opioid crisis by passing the bipartisan Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act that empowers communities to address the opioid crisis locally
I also spoke on the house for this week to urge my colleagues to vote for the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act
With the rapidly changing job market, quality education and training are vital for a thriving work force
Im a grateful sponsor of this piece of legislation and was pleased when it passed the House to create jobs
This week in Congress, I attended hearings in the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Committee on Education and Workforce
In the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, we passed a bill that prohibits any future ransom payments to Iran, a state sponsor of terrorism
When the Obama Administration provided the Iranian regime was $1
7 billion worth of untraceable foreign cash, they put American families of risk of attack
This week I sent a letter to the Acting Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, demanding answers on what steps his office took to ensure that the payment will not be used to support terrorist activities to kill Americans
I look forward to continuing to advocate for this legislation when it comes before the full House led by Chairman Ed Royce
The Committee on Education and the Workforce met to discuss the Juvenile Justice Reform
Im grateful to support this legislation of the Supporting Youth Opportunity and Preventing Delinquency Act of 2016, because this legislation provides necessary resources to state and local officials to better serve at risk youth and drug offenders
This week I appreciated being recognized by the National Federation of Independent Business as a Guardian of Small Business and I am strongly committed to supporting small business, free enterprise, creating jobs in the 2nd Congressional District
I especially appreciate that NFIB is a bottoms-up organization where the members vote on issues and endorsements that matter to them, not directed by Washington
I enjoyed meeting with many constituent groups while they were in the Washington area this week
I met with representatives from the American Cancer Society, South Carolina Principal of the Year Dr
Bill Coon, and a group from the United Fresh Produce Association
Whats great about the CashCourse dictionary is that I can look up things that I dont understand on, say, bills or applications for student loans.

I’m Dr. David Michaels, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health.
Under the law, employers have the responsibility to provide a safe workplace.

MARY ANN BELLIVEAU: So I think marketers in this space have realized the importance of making sure that they have really good information thats available to consumers when theyre looking for it, at that point in time where theyre raising their hand and theyre saying, hey, I really need information about a particular condition, whether its high cholesterol or heart disease or diabetes.
RON TRENKA: The post-recession consumer is a smarter consumer.
They dont have as much disposable income.
So they have to very carefully plan out what theyre buying.

- Something weird happened to me
I woke up early and I wasnt exhausted and I was just laying in bed thinking about all of the problems that are going on in my life and how I couldnt wait to get to SoulCycle to sweat out all my problems
Who the hell am I
- I forgot Im working out
I was more focusing on my dream, my goals, my fears, and how to achieve all this
- I like that he said, The next 45 minutes isnt gonna change your life, but its gonna help change your day

Okay, when youre picking a speech topic, the very first thing you have to look at is what kind of speech are you suppose to deliver.

This is Tom Floyd, Vice President of Real Estate at Member One Federal Credit Union bringing you another Member One Money Minute
Today, I want to talk to you a little bit about credit
A lot of people ask, What kind of credit do I need in order to buy a home? Well, theres no set answer, but theres a couple of things we look for
We kind of look for 640 as kind of a minimum score that were trying to have in order to get an approval, and obviously, the higher the score, the easier your approval will be
The score is a reflection of how well you pay your bills, what type of credit you use, how many inquiries you have, what are the balances of your credit cards to your maximum limit
So, you want to be very careful about those items
Another general tip is were looking for three credit items to be open for a minimum of 12 months, so if you dont have any credit, you need to go out and borrow some money to build up your credit history before you go get a mortgage, which is the biggest piece of credit youll ever get
And at Member One, we also offer, besides mortgages, personal loans, we have credit cards, we have starter loans, so we have everything that you need to help build your credit if youre at that point
By far my favorite one, which I guess is why I´m the guy in his 40s

Hi Im ASIC Commissioner Greg Tanzer.
Today’s Fairfax papers report on bribery allegations against the Reserve Bank of Australia and its note printing subsidiaries - and ASIC’s decision not to take the matter further.
The ABC’s Four Corners is doing a story on this tonight.
It is important to note the Australian Federal Police has already charged people involved in this and those cases are before the courts.
The AFP also asked ASIC to see if directors of these companies breached the Corporations Act.
Let me be crystal clear: ASIC looked at this matter very closely but, based on the facts, decided not to take the matter further.
What we did do was review more than 10,000 pages of documents including several detailed witness statements.
As there are related prosecutions before the court, we are not in a position to detail the reasons for our decision, but the public can be completely and utterly confident in what ASIC did.

Letter came through the mail to try Beltone  I decided that I would try and compare it  with my other hearing aid.
And when they put the digital device on my ear it just opened the world up to me:  sounds of everything, people talking clearly,  and I just realized what I was missing.
Welcome to The Tradex Foods 3-Minute Market Insight Here are some timely updates for you.
---There is a second life to the Prince William Sound pink salmon fishery.
Strong landings of large and bright pink salmon are coming in.
Prices have remained stable throughout most of the season and are expected to hold.
---Chum salmon pricing has remained stable over the past week with good movement of fresh fish.
On a positive note suppliers have reported strong sales for export over the past week with both Europe and China active in the market.
It is expected that European buyers will become more active in September after the August vacation lul.
---British Columbia Canada chum salmon is expected to be MSC certified any time now.
MSC said that a report addressing stakeholder concerns was being drafted and expected the first week of August.
No official report or comment from MCS has confirmed it was released.
MSC was able to say that the surveyor recommended the fishery for certification.
Provided there are no unforseen delays certification could come as early as September.
Companies are warned that selling fish that is pending certification requires adding the under assessement fishery to your scope.
Hi everyone.
Its Alejandra and I want to tell you about  one of my favorite organizing products from The container Store.
I  have a list of probably about ten or fifteen different  products that I always use in spaces that I organize.
And one of those products are these self-adhesive instant wheels.
I discovered these wheels probably about six months ago  when I was just browsing The Container Store and I am so  glad I bought them.
I went home and I put them on my  laundry hamper because my hamper is always so heavy to  move from my bedroom to my laundry room.
Im Dr Graham Pike from the Department of Psychology at the OU and Im a forensic psychologist.
Forensic psychology is concerned with all aspects of crime in a criminal investigative procedure.
One thing forensic psychologists have done is look at witness memory, particularly how we can help the police to get the most out of what a witness has seen of a crime.
So there are interviewing techniques based on psychological theories of memory that tell police how to go about interviewing a witness.
One thing that might happen is that we allow a witness simply to recall everything they can without interrupting them.
Something else we might do is try to mentally reinstate the crime scene to the witness, that is to get them to imagine as if theyre back at the crime scene, to think about the weather, the temperature and the smells there.
By doing that the witness can remember more accurate information.
One of the reasons its so important to look at witness memory is theres an expectation that our brains act a bit like a computer.
and so we worked with OFGEM and the Department of Energy and of Climate… - Department of Energy and Climate Change that administers this
to work out a method whereby glass could become part of this process, if you like
We’ve been successful in doing that
The fundamental opportunity that we identified through this process is that
there are 13 million homes in the UK that have windows that were fitted more than 10 years ago
which are not very efficient windows and we identified that by replacing the old
altered technology glass with modern, energy efficient glass
we could save significant energy and significant levels of CO2
Glass technology has advanced so much in the last 10 years

My name is Frederick Ricky B. Burchell with B4 Entertainment on behalf of Expert Village, and today were going to talk about producing, manufacturing, marketing, and distributing your independent CD.
Here, invisible yet strong, was the taboo of the old life, Golding writes
Round the squatting child was the protection of parents and school and policemen and the law
 But those taboos break down pretty quickly and soon Roger is torturing other boys, a job he really enjoys
So much for your mom telling you that bullies are just insecure
What Golding is saying is that were all bullies
Well act viciously as long as we think we can get away with it
Before hes killed, Piggy, the fat asthmatic intellectual, asks, What are we
 Humans, or animals, or savages
 And Goldings answer is D -- all of the above
In Goldings world view, the authority and social structures of what he calls civilisation bind us together, and without those, the boys on the island never really have a chance

There are actually quite a few ways to create a financial plan, based on your own financial situation.
Hey everybody whats up I wanted to do a review of the new Kanye West, Paul McCartney and Rihanna Collaboration Four Five Seconds.
It got released about a day or so ago and the twittisphere is exploding with it so lets talk about their new song.
Now this is the second collaboration that we know of that Kanye West has done with Paul McCartney.
They released a song Only One about a month or so ago and we sort of got an insight into how dumb some of Kanyes fans are from the statements they were posting on Twitter asking who Paul McCartney is, saying this Paul McCartney kid is going to go far and that Kanye has a good ear for talent and you know what it is sort of understandable these people who are Kanye fans are a lot younger they probably werent around when the Beatles were big and you know we live in a day and age now where its so difficult to find information.
If you have a question where do you go to find information I mean oh wait there is a way to find information its called Google.
If you have a question about anything you just Google it and you can find so much information at your finger tips, but i guess people choose not to use common sense to do that but anyways getting back to the song.
Ive always found when big talent superstar collaborate that their is so much expectation of what the song is going to sound like its never going to meet expectations and this is one of those examples.
I wasnt a fan of Only One I thought it was pretty disappointing to me and this song I didnt have much expectation going in.
I am a fan of Paul McCartney and Rihanna , but i am not a big Kanye fan, but i do recognize that he is a pretty talented guy.
Now this song does sound in some respects like Only One in terms of how stripped down it is.
Theres no drums in the song, this song unlike Only One doesnt sound like there are any keyboards theres no drums and no auto tune and its basically Paul McCartney playing acoustic guitar and Rihanna and Kanye share vocal duties going back and forth.
And Rihannas vocals are definitely pretty screechy on this song and Kanye has some pretty tuneless singing.
Kanye has never been the greatest singer in terms of his singing voice and thats probably why he relies so heavily on auto tune, but this song reminds me of that awful collaboration that Michael Jackson did with Paul McCartney.


Now lets talk about organizational pattern, and when I talk about organizational pattern, Im talking about the order in which you put your information.
In this module, were are focusing specifically on spatial data.
We start by taking a little bit of a refresher on the three components of the ArcGIS software.
Now in Module 1 you were exposed to ArcMap and ArcCatalog.
So you should remember that ArcMap is the component--the main component of ArcGIS.
This is where you create your data, edit data, view data, analyze your map, create maps, it is the workhorse of the ArcGIS program.
The second component is ArcCatalog is more focused on database management so you should remember how you search through the different datasets, change projection, added thumbnails, everything like that.
And then the last part, ArcToolbox, the last component is the one we will be exploring towards the end of the course.
Where we get into looking at very specific geoprocessing tools.
Also in this module we start to really dive into the world of spatial data.
Make sure you pay attention to the difference between our two key types of spatial data models vector and raster data.
Make sure you know the difference between the two, but also know how each data model represents the real world in the computer program.
So what are the differences?
How did the final products look different?
And pay attention to where error is introduced and the limitations of both data models.
The last part of these lecture slides really dive into those key concepts related to ArcGIS and GIS in general.
So pay attention to the key concepts and key terms because they come up throughout the semester and throughout the time that you are exposed to GIS software.
Make sure you understand the difference between layers and features, and shapefiles and feature classes classes, and feature classes and feature datasets.
We also talk about the importance of attributes.
Attributes are really are what set apart GIS software and just a paper map showing the place.
ArcMap allows us to display these not nonspatial features, for example population of the state, population change...  what else can we display... disease  rates.
All of these things can be stored within the shapefile data as an attribute table-- can be displayed.
Now that weve talked about whether your choosing battery powered or hardwired, youve got to determine how and when youre going to use this.
The beauty of this is its totally customizable.
You can set your GPS to turn on a Monday through a Friday and not work on the weekends.
You can set it so that its motion activated  -- The minute you move your car, the GPS turns on.
You can also set it so that its on every minute of every day.
Okay, so youve got your killer introduction.
Now we need to talk about the conclusion.
But when theyre injured the heal with scar tissue and now they dont glide as much, right, and they create this knot in there
The knot doesnt move very well, its very restricted, and the bodys not sure whats going on so it has nerve endings going down there to figure out whats going on
So its very easily irritated again
This is soft tissue technique breaks that scar tissue down, and eventually the muscles start to glide and arrange an emotion just in two visits, when does it actually, improve probably twenty or thirty percent right
So Im going to do one more pass
Bring it out like this, arm out in front of you, and lets have you take your chin down
CRAIG SCIME: Hey its Craig Scime from Clearstarmedia.com and today we are talking at Expert Village about YouTube, how to get on YouTube and how to navigate through it.
The last segment we talked about how to edit your clip once you upload it.
But lets say you dont have a digital camera or a camcorder and you really want to get something on YouTube.
Well of course the easiest way is go to a friend that has one but lets say you cant find anybody and you want to get on there right now and you just want to have an idea or you want to just speak your mind or even do a little sack puppet show, whatever it is you can do it on YouTube but the really easy way to do it is get yourself one of these.
Its a little webcam.
- [Voiceover] Yeah, but let me point out that you did say all white men

So, Jackson is unabashedly a racist
And his vision of manifest destiny really involves the eradication of all Native Americans
- [Voiceover] I mean, this is a really dark time for American Indian policy
This is when we see something called the Indian Removal Act, that is literally what its called
Jacksons presidency is also marked by the Cherokee Diaspora, the forced removal of the Cherokee along whats called the Trail of Tears


So, before Jackson, do we really have the Democratic Party as an institution
I could go back right now but Im just really tired so I dont think its a good idea for me to go back out and drive to the hospital again

computer program efficiently, whereas low IQ might prevent you from doing so
Emotional intelligence, or EQ, has been defined in many ways
For our purposes, I define EQ as the ability to process painful emotions in healthy and effective ways
 For example, high EQ might enable you to cope with the pain of losing a job by talking with trusted friends or family, practicing self-care skills, allowing yourself to grieve the loss of the job, and employing problem-solving skills for finding a new job
Low EQ, on the other hand, might cause you to deal with your pain by drinking or drugging, self-cutting, catastrophizing, beating up on yourself, of falling into hopelessness

In this clip on how to audition for a Broadway play, Im going to talk about objective.
This is one of the most important things in acting; what do you want in you monologue?
So if I say; if Im talking to my best friend, Im talking about this person who loves me, I say that he loves me; he knows me for who I am and he loves me, he cant help himself from loving me for exactly who I am.
This is my monologue from Queens Boulevard; I, what do I want; why am I telling my best friend this?
In my mind’s eye; its always good to pick a subject verb, a strong action.
The human brain is not strictly an organ that develops according to genetics
Infact nothing is, as I gave the example of the seed, I mean if you want that seed to grow you have to plant in the right kind of ground with the right conditions of light, and irrigation, and nutrition
Well the human brain also develops in response to the environment especially the human brain because most of our brain growth occurs after birth and not before
About 80 percent happens after birth, and much of that in the first three years of life, so by the end the third year of life the human brain is something like 80 or 90 percent adult size
Whereas the human body is about 18 percent adult size
So those first three years are hugely important
May back in the seventies, but the marriage never ended up happening
However, decades later we were shown that the two of them consummated the union… before the marriage itself
To make things even more disgusting, this was the storyline where Doc Ock swapped minds with Peter Parker, just before deciding to become the Superior Spider-Man and during this process, Peter got a front row seat to that display
This makes the time that Peter walked in on his aunt WAAAAY less intense by comparison
So hey, did you know that Wolverine and Squirrel Girl had a thing
Yeah, when Wolverine joined the New Avengers, their team leader, Luke Cage, decided to get a nanny for when he and Jessica Jones were going to be out fighting crime

Actually, none of that is what were talking about
What it means is you cant be prohibited from being part of a certain religion, although it doesnt mean that any religious practice is okay

We are gonna anger a lot of Aztecs with this video, Stan
There are a number of cases that establish this distinction between religious belief and religious practice, but my personal favorite is Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye vs
Hialeah, because I love saying Lukumi Babalu Aye
You probably figured out that what these two clauses mean in practice has been determined to some degree by Supreme Court decisions

Co-op marketing is of paramount importance for retailers.
It was interesting, because McCarthy was still alive when I did that play, and the audience was scared.
There was a certain hostility to the play – no question about it.
But then he died, and within a year a small group of young people did it off-Broadway.
I think it may have been the first off-Broadway production, ever, and it became a big success then – in a much worse production than the original one, but they were passionate, and they really were terrific.
They had a great production in France with Simon Signoret and Yves Montand, I am told that created a real big clamor.
Spotify client and using the client, so well be doing things where we may show a teaser on the channels but then you have to go into the client to actually see all of the content and were looking at other ways to engage people and at the end of the day, we want people listening to music so anything we can do to get people more engaged with the product, thats what we want to do on our social media channels
My name is Billy Gascoigne,  I’m an economist with the USGS Fort Collins Science Center  in Fort Collins Colorado I’m involved in incorporating  some of the economic and human dimensions research  for the Landscape Conservation Cooperative.
Well I think the biggest conservation challenge today,  is conservation itself as a land management strategy  going against competing land uses, largely driven by economic incentives.
Our research is designed to  highlight and estimate the economic contribution  of some of the conserved habitats here in the prairie and pothole region.
Some of those contributions arent necessarily all that apparent.
So we want to highlight those impacts and make that link between habitat conditions and social and economic impacts.
We feel that that side of the story  doesn’t get told all that often  and it’s a very important piece  to make sound land management decisions.
For wetlands, for instance,   someone might say,  oh there’s not that much economic value to it.
But that could pull in a lot of resident  and non-resident hunters every year.
Those hunters might contribute  a lot to the local community  in terms of restaurants, motels,  gas stations, other service industries.
It can also have value just to the local residents in terms of open view sheds and quality of life.

Tēnā koutou katoa, Talofa lava and good afternoon
Welcome to EPIC conference 2016
As Minister of Ethnic Communities I welcome you all – especially those who have travelled from overseas and outside of Auckland
This conference is important to raise the visibility and awareness of migrant businesses
It is also about enabling local businesses to connect with other businesses both here and abroad
First it was a “supercity”

We have made it that way – and it’s a good thing
Almost half of the population in Auckland today are Maori, Asian and Pacific peoples and there are over 200 ethnicities represented here
Superdiversity brings with it enormous benefits such as greater innovation, productivity and investment
Right here at this conference you have a huge opportunity to unlock the benefits of diversity
We have a full range of excellent speakers on the program including our very own Prime Minister the Rt Hon John Key
We have Wei Gao and Sir George Fistonich and they have typical migrant stories of struggle, hard work and success and I know in this conference centre there are many more stories of achievement that will play out going forward
Like Sir George and Wei, we need to harness the energy and innovation that diversity creates to support new business ventures as well as grow existing businesses
And you will receive expert insights as to the importance of marketing and customer relations
I am encouraged that you will be making connections, and exchanging ideas that will help us unlock the benefits of diversity for New Zealand in a connected global market
&gt;&gt; Role models are very important for the region, especially in the area of environment because the Middle East is really suffering from very big environmental problems, especially the contribution to the global climate change to the region is quite important.

This meeting was particularly important to the grantees because it moved them in their evaluation thinking from making sure that they had a product or solution that was of good enough integrity to use with patients to thinking much more broadly about the evaluation: How was this going to impact the physician?
How was it going to – the content and the use of ODLs – going to be detected in the individual care of a patient?
I think that social justice is the foundation of a good society.
It is respect for others, it is fairness, it is the dignity of work, and it is a recognition that we all have to share in the benefits of development and growth.
Unfortunately that’s not the situation today, that’s why we have to fight for it.
Social justice is a way of reacting to a crisis but also of organizing society and the essence of the whole thing is that it is an approach, it’s a system, it is the conviction that certain values have to be there.
Is it possible?
This is the history of change; you always have to fight for social justice.
Today it means recognition that one of the best ways to get to social justice is decent work, it is the dignity of work, the dignity of the human being, the stability of the family, the peace in the community that decent work gives you.
I think that the essence of the way business has to approach social justice is to understand that it is also good for business.
That productivity and competitiveness leads to a fair distribution of the fruits of labour and this is the essence of the ILO approach.
That you have a fair chance at whatever wealth you contributed to creating and every successful enterprise knows that.
The ILO has highlighted that there is a link between social justice and a fair globalization; in fact we put together a Declaration on that issue.
The key question is that we have to move from a globalization that is unfair and unbalanced and unsustainable into something that actually people look at and say “hey, I’ve got a fair chance of being part of this”. That is not the situation today.
The crisis has made it more difficult and that’s why the struggle for social justice  - because it is a struggle - is so fundamental and so key.
And there are many people in the world that understand and believe this and we have to get this into the economic system.
The essence of addressing social justice from the perspective of young people is to acknowledge that we have a generational debt to the young people.

Thank you for joining us for The Tradex Foods 3-Minute Sustainability Recap The following information is a rundown of key sustainability news items for the month of December.
In Britain, the National Fish &amp; Chips Awards announced finalists for the 2012 Good Catch Award for Sustainability.
The Bay in Stonehaven, Harbour Lights in Falmouth and Frankie’s in Brae each got the nod.
The Good Catch Awards honor fish and chip shops who have made the biggest contributions in support of sustainable sourcing.
Also in the UK – the Marine Conservation Society conducted a survey assessing supermarket seafood.
Marks &amp; Spencer came out on top with a score of 84 percent, followed by Sainsbury and Waitrose.
No other supermarkets received scores that merited an award.
And Tuna Processor Asian Alliance International – a processor of frozen fish based out of Thailand - is the newest member of the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation.
ISSF members advocate for improved fishing methods, fund scientific advancement and take direct action to spur change with respect to seafood sustainability.
Preliminary assessments of the Gulf of Maine Cod stock indicate that it could have been much smaller in 2008 than previously thought.
An alarming report found that in 2010 the stock was only about 20 percent of its fully rebuilt size and that fishing rates have been almost five times the overfishing level.
Next up - Anderson Seafoods has joined and the Aquarium of the Pacific’s Seafood for the Future Program.
The program will help Andersons advance its commitments with respect to seafood sustainability, educate existing suppliers and find new suppliers with similar positions on seafood sustainability.
As part of my ERASMUS, I spent the year in the Institute of Political Studies in Rennes, France.
One of the many benefits of studying at such a prestigious university was the option to communicate with such a variety of different students from all corners of the world.
Going through the situation with people of the same age meant that I felt more comfortable - I was at ease in dealing with living in such a different culture.
In terms of the academic benefits, having to persevere to keep to their higher standards meant I was better prepared for my year back here at Aston.
They are at one level but if you can do without them its fine.
Were talking about organization.
Now lets talk about the body.
These are things that you want to take a look at when youre evaluating a speech.
Do you have student loans that are reporting past late payments on your credit report? Student Loans are the scariest kind of Debt
You cant remove them through bankruptcy and if you dont pay them, they never fall off your credit report
My name is Jesse Rodriguez with CreditCEO and I look at Credit Reports every single day
There is a huge problem that I see on hundreds, if not thousands of credit reports and it is student loans reporting past late payments when they were supposed to be in deferment
Today Im going to show you how you can correct student loans that are reporting past late payments on your Credit
Everyone gets in a bind with their student loans for a different reason
Theres not always going to be one solution what works for each person
Even if the late payments weren’t because you were in deferment, there is still an option for you without having to pay some company a bunch of money to fix it
Option 1 is the student loan late payment forgiveness program
If you have past due lates on your credit from your student loan company, I want you to call the lender and ask them about the student loan late payment forgiveness program
The way that it works is they will set you up on a payment plan, if you’re not already on one
After you make 9 on-time payments to the repayment plan, it will automatically remove all of the past derogatory reporting from those student loans that were included in the forgiveness program
Now, what if you paid all of your student loans on time, but they’re still reporting late payments? Then, what you need to do is, reach out to us and we will give you a free credit audit and consultation
If you have student loans and you havent even checked your credit in the last couple months, you could have late payments and not even know about it
You need to check your credit regularly! If your loan was in deferment but theyre reporting late payment, that is a great reason to go in and file a dispute
We can help you with that, so you dont make any mistakes, but you can also do it yourself
Theres other videos here on our channel that explain what the dispute process is and how you can do it for yourself
So I hope this was helpful and I hope that you can get your student loan late payments removed from your credit report
You need to make paying your student loans a priority
If you want to get an FHA loan, theyre not going to allow you to get an FHA loan if you have past defaulted student loans
They never go away, theres not a 7 or 10 year statute of limitations on student loans and you cant include them in bankruptcy
Get out of your student loan debt, kick some serious butt and get motivated to make a change in your life
If you found this video to be helpful please like it, subscribe to our Channel and leave a comment
Hi, Im Laura from youngwritersworkshop.com, and Im going to talk about how to write a campaign speech.
A campaign speech has to really get someones attention.
Believe it or not, people dont really want to listen to a long speech most of the time.
And so you really have to do your best to capture the listeners interest in the beginning of the speech by connecting to an issue thats going to be of interest to them and of importance to them.
Now, the development of your speech is going to be a lot like developing an essay.
You need to come up with one or two points, and then continue to support that point in a way that will help it flow, help people understand it.
Deadpan is a form of comic delivery in which humor is presented without a change in emotion or body language.
It is usually spoken in a casual, monotone, or cantankerous voice, and expresses a calm, sincere, or grave demeanor, often in spite of the ridiculousness of the subject matter.
This delivery is also called dry humor or dry wit, when the intent, but not the presentation, is humorous, blunt, oblique, sarcastic, laconic, or apparently unintentional.
Etymology The term deadpan first emerged as an adjective or adverb in the 1920s, as a compound word combining dead and pan. The oldest usage recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary comes from The New York Times, which defines the term as playing a rôle with expressionless face. An example of this usage is in a scene from the 1934 film The Gay Bride in which a gangster tells a man on the other end of a phone conversation to give it a dead pan, so that the man does not inadvertently alert anyone else in the room as to the importance of what the gangster is about to say.
The usage of deadpan as a verb is recorded at least as far back as 1942. Examples Many popular American sitcoms use deadpan expressions to deliver dry humor, most notably Curb Your Enthusiasm, Arrested Development, The Office, Red vs.
Blue and Seinfeld.
Some good current examples are the characters April Ludgate from the TV show Parks and Recreation played by Aubrey Plaza, or Bob Newhart as Arthur Jeffries in The Big Bang Theory.
Another example is the often philosophical comedy of Steven Wright.
Dry humor is often confused with highbrow or egghead humor, because the humor in dry humor does not exist in the words, their delivery, or both.
Instead, the listener must look for humor in the contradiction between words, delivery and context.
Failure to include the context or to identify the contradiction results in the listener finding the dry humor unfunny.
However, the term deadpan itself actually only refers to the method of delivery.
Other deadpan comedians: Stephen Colbert Christopher Walken Jimmy Carr Buster Keaton Peter Sellers Jonathan Katz Aubrey Plaza Todd Barry Jack Handey Mitch Hedberg Demetri Martin Paul Merton Nathan Fielder Tim &amp; Eric Leslie Nielsen Jane Curtin Jim Gaffigan Dan Mintz Jack Dee H.
Jon Benjamin Styles within deadpan Deadpan can vary in subtlety.

Hi Everyone, Im Kathy Graf
I want to welcome you to digital storytelling
Im here on the Appalachian Trail today which is a great place for a digital story
I look forward to working with you this semester as you write your scripts, create your stories, edit your stories, and publish your stories

So lets have a great semester, and I look forward to seeing your stories
Hi, this is Elaine with Investors Business Daily and were about two hours away from the close right now and Ive got a slightly after midday market update for you.
So major indexes are all broadly down as housing starts for July exceeded expectations and the consumer price index for the month was unchanged, as expected.The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are both down around 0.4% and the NASDAQ is down 0.5%. Off-price retailer TJX is down over 5% today despite a Q2 beat on Q3 and full-year outlook that fell short of expectations.
Now that means that shares have now fallen out of buy range after clearing a 79.26 entry point last month.
Ross stores is also down slightly today.
meanwhile Macys is up around 1% continuing a five session win streak which is sort of an interesting juxtaposition for both department stores and off-price retailers, since off-pricers have generally been seen as outperformers in the retail space, while department stores have generally been struggling.
Because our majors have a variety of career goals in mind we offer them a variety of internship experiences based on their specific needs and their specific goals.
Im also co-director of the center for civic engagement which has a long history of active participation by sociologists here, and as co-director I arrange internships with community-based organizations working on social justice, deepening democracy and promoting sustainability in the area.
These experiences are not just the sort of internships where you do the Xeroxing for some organization, but in fact theyre real learning, hands-on experiences where you meet the clients or the people that are served by this organization where you work with them, where you follow professionals and mirror what they do.
You get not only a lot of experience but an idea whether of that is the right career path for you.

This is financial advisor, Patrick Munro, talking about what is the definition of a municipal bond fund?
Bonds are IOUs, and they vary from various entity to various entity.
This is Financial Advisor Patrick Munro, talking to you about how a household budget works.
Many Americans do not have a household budget, so as a result, theyre ending up seeing less a month left and less money at the end of the month.
Its very important and critical that you develop a budget and the way to do it is to set up essential items, which are shelter, food, clothing, insurance, the various items that you really cannot do without.
Well, one thing that I think that women, or the people in general, dont realise is that women vote more than men in the States, and women just dont run for office in nearly the numbers that men do, but this is looking like it might be a really great year for women in politics we have more women running for office this year than weve ever had before, and, more democrats and republicans but its still a nice mix and thats really exciting to me, because of course in the 2010 election we actually lost - we went backwards with just a tiny bit with the number of women in elected office.
Recently we had a great event thanks to the former National Society of Hispanic MBAs, which is now Prospanica
And the event was called Career Accelerator
It was an opportunity for current MBA and graduate students to practice their interview and their resume skills
A question that was asked a lot before, during, and after the event was: How to prepare for an interview? And there are several things that you have to do to be ready for an interview, but one important thing is to practice your stories
And one thing I tell people to help them understand what practicing their stories means is that they have to think of themselves as comedians
Comedians practice their material all the time, not because they are fake just because they want their audience to have the time of their life
Thats exactly what you have to think of when you are going to an interview but instead of telling jokes you are telling your professional stories, you are telling the stories of the challenges youve faced in your professional career and youre gonna tell them the steps you took to overcome those challenges
So always be thinking STAR method
Situation, Task, Action, Result
So that your stories can be efficient and effective in communicating what you wanna communicate
Its important that you are practicing your stories because we are going to have a great opportunity here in Houston

or N+2 configurations, for example, where you can have redundancy built into the chassis

The advantage of that for an operator of a network, or even an individual station, is that you can see where there is a fault or a problem developing
By monitoring the stream in various location along the path, you can see exactly where the faults occurred
For instance, it could be the satellite uplink, downlink, or a fiber system, or it could be at the input to the transmitter
someone coming from a stated non believing perspective treating what is too many people Sacred Scripture, you might get more friction and controversy there, too
I think the frame of mind that anyone can take into the movie if you want to see it and you know are wondering what youre going to see is really you know that the book is always better than the movie and so if you want the real unadulterated Bible go read the Bible the Bible is a pretty interesting book but if you want a movie interpretation thats what youre going to get
I think its a real question some people have about using the sacred scriptures of particular faiths to create modern entertainment and theres ethics in that, there definitely are
MARC SAMUELS: I think the ability to tap into chat rooms, patient groups, to do what the-- if youre a hospital or a doc again, what pharma companies have traditionally done and tap into patient organizations and large advocacy patient groups, is the best way to find out and keep track of where you are, where your competitors are, where the industry is in terms of thinking about how to keep up with patients who are now empowered.
Same thing to have a strategy, I think, that provides information over the internet through various forms of social media.
MALE SPEAKER: Frank, Jerome is asking, how do you feel in orbit after several months? FRANK DE WINNE: Well as you can see, Jerome, Im feeling just great
Floating in orbit is just nice
You can very nicely stay always in equilibrium after a couple of months
In the beginning, youre kind of going like all over the place
And now, it just seems so relaxing
So life is great here
The food is good
The company is good
I have a fantastic crew
And also, the work is great
We do a lot of scientific work, also a lot of maintenance
So Im having a good time here on orbit
MALE SPEAKER: Karina wants to know, how much time does the crew spend working outside the space station? FRANK DE WINNE: Well Karina, actually, the crew spends little time working outside the space station, because its very dangerous
If you go outside as well, you need to have one of those, a space suit
And its very difficult to maintain the space suit
It takes a lot of work
But its also very hard to work inside of them
So therefore, we try to spend as least time as possible outside of the space station
This is why we use a lot of robotics tasks, for example
Its what I did with the HDV and the experiments that we based outside of the Japanese module, Kibo
There is two methods that I would actually highlight right now in terms of what we’re doing to get better consumer insight.
One is a tool that we developed which is called Star Com EQ, which is emotional intelligence research.
So we have done several waves of research talking to consumers where we’re looking to understand what are the emotional need states that they are looking to answer when they make media channel selection.
And what the content in those channels is doing to solve emotional need states.
And it’s actually become a wonderful tool in really understanding what is driving consumers channel selection.
And it’s not always rational, it’s very much emotional at times.
The other thing that we have done is we are putting in place global communities, it is called the mic at Star Com, and these are global listening communities that we have where we can at any point in time put out questions to these communities.
Epogen, the brand name form of epoetin alfa, is a prescription medication used to treat anemia due to the effects disease or other medications
Epogen belongs to a group of drugs called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, which help increase the amount of red blood cells in the body
This medication comes in injectable form to be given into a or just under the skin
Some of the common side effects of Epogen include nausea, vomiting, fever, and tiredness
Always take this medication only as prescribed
Hey folks, this is the Cinematic Seth
Before I start this video, I would like to apologize because I havent posted a video in weeks to several months
Now the reason for that is because of stuff in my personal life, such as work, my best friend, and my girlfriend who Ive been spending a lot of time with
And working a lot at my new job
So thats what has been holding me back, as far as content goes
Today, Im going to be reviewing a movie I saw weeks ago
It is called Cinderella
Im not referring to the old animated Disney movie or the movie Ever After, which was a great adaptation
Now, Im going to be reviewing the newest Cinderella live-action movie
I didnt know what to expect going into this movie
You know, kids movies half the time dont work for me and half the time they do
So I was curious as to how they could pull it off and, surprisingly, they pull it off really well in this movie
Of course I stayed until the end to look at some of the credits and the ironic thing is I saw that the writing credit was to Chris Weitz
Who is Chris Weitz, you may ask? He is one of the two brothers who directed the 1999 teen raunchy comedy film American Pie
[briefly chuckles] Thats kind of like a contrast as far as content
A movie that had a lot of language and sexual content, this movie is toned down to PG



Went from directing an R rated movie to writing a script for a family friendly audience
More power to him, I dont blame him
So its the typical story of Cinderella, the structure is the same and its very faithful to the source material that its attempting to do
I really liked the characters in the movie, the performances were really well, the visual effects were spectacular
I was amazed at how advanced theyve gotten lately in movies when it comes to that
I want you all to meet my new girlfriend, Issy
So I am going to ask her what she thought of the movie
Hi Issy! Whatd you think about the movie Cinderella? I liked it! Was it really good? Yeah
From a 1 to 10, what would you give the movie Cinderella? 10

As for me, I would give the movie an 8 out of 10
I think its really good
So thats my thoughts on Cinderella
I dont know if its still playing in theaters but I liked it, I thought it was pretty good
I hope you all enjoyed this video and if you did, feel free to like and subscribe, because I will be posting more content on this channel
Again, I dont have a weekly (upload) schedule, which is not a good thing
But I will stay up to date with my content posting
Im really sorry I took a hiatus
I just want to let all of my subscribers know that I did not quit making videos and that Im going to keep making more of these movie reviews
The Road Not Taken BY ROBERT FROST Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both and be one traveler, Long I stood and looked down one as far as I could to where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black
Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back
In years past we would conduct focus groups to find out about a market need or a consumer need and talk with our customers.

My name is Florinel Ilinca, I am local   councillor in the Barcea City Hall,  I represent the Romani community in the commune Barcea, village Podoleni.
I say something from my own experience: if a Romanian enters   our community, he will find it difficult to part.
Because this is how we, the Roma, are.
We are very warm-hearted   people, we put a lot of heart in communication.
Because we have not communicated for a very long   period of time, during the enslavement,  we started now to communicate and if we are   well received by the majority population,  we will dedicate heart and soul to it.
I think we are not well-known because this is not wished, according   to my experience of 12 years in the local council.
I feel this thing, that soon things will start to change.
Yes, yes, and yes
But more than that, the great Gatsby lives in a cold world that cares nothing for justice, a world that makes claims to fairness but really only further rewards those who have already been rewarded
I mean, who even survives this novel
Only the idle rich: Jordan Baker, Daisy and Tom Buchanan, Nick Carraway
They survive, and they are allowed to go on being careless
As Nick writes, They were careless people, Tom and Daisy -- they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness
 They arent cruel or malicious, theyre just careless -- they dont care too much about Myrtle or Gatsby or their daughter or even each other
To live without a care in the world is supposed to be the dream, right
Everyone wants a care-free life
I came to Philips Design in the then newly group of social scientists, trying to come up with a more thorough research approach to designing.
with a lot of designers who were thinking very well of themselves because they were really focusing on users already and then having to accept a new discipline into their processes.
and learn to read this new type of knowledge, or hear the new type of social science kind of stuff.
You see, Restons campaign is saying that I dont have the experience to be president
Let me tell you a story about my grandmother Every time that I used to date a new boyfriend She would ask his name and then she would go like and what part of the city does he live in? That was her way of asking if my boyfriend was white She was an out and out racist So I know the face of prejudice Governor Reston is telling me I dont have the balls to be president And he means that literally Its offensive Its offensive to me Its offensive to every woman out there who he is asking the votes for Tonight I am here stating that governor Reston is a sexist But you know what
Its not even just about him going around and talking in codes about gender its everyone Yourself included The only reason why we are here tonight in this interview in my house is because you requested it, right? it was entirely your idea and here still you are thinking that you are being welcomed into my lovely place You are thanking me for that This is the thing that you say to your next door lady that bakes you chocolate chips cookies This pitcher of iced tea is not even mine Your producer set it here And why is that? For the same reason that you call me a real life Cinderella story You are telling the world that I am a woman Without having to use the word And for you its just an angle and I get it You might even think that its innocuous But guess what? Its not


Good afternoon.
Id like to welcome the thousands of you from governments around the world, NGOs, public and private organizations, and elsewhere, who are taking part in the third biennial International Family Planning Conference.
Im really sorry that I couldnt be with you in person in Addis Ababa, but I want to tell you that, as both the U.S.
Secretary of State and the father of two extraordinary young women, I am exceedingly grateful for your hard work and dedication to this cause.
Millions of women, men, and children have better lives today thanks to the work that many of you have done for decades.
In 1994, when I was a U.S.
Senator, I attended the historic International Conference on Population and Development.
What was clear back then is still clear today: that challenges like reproductive health care and family planning are bigger than the political boxes that some try to force them into.
These are basic human necessities that hundreds of millions of women are forced to go without.
For some, its because they cant afford or dont have access to these services.
For others, its because their husbands or their communities simply dont support their use.
Thats why the United States and our partners must continue our life-saving work to advocate for sexual health and reproductive rights.
That includes universal access to voluntary family planning.

As the U.S.
convenes the leaders of the G-8 this coming weekend, there are three issues I think are going to be on many peoples minds in watching the meetings unfold.
So it’s important to remember that we have to talk about the issue of engagement very very broadly.
The United States government for decades has engaged with many different types of people and we continue to do so.
We have programs that are very robust on the educational level.
Capgemini and Efma recently released the ninth annual World Retail Banking Report that indicates customer retention is in flux and nine percent of customers are likely to leave their banks in the next six months while 40 percent are unsure theyll stay long term.
Quality of service (53 percent), fees, (50 percent), ease of use (49 percent) and interest rates (49 percent) represent the biggest impact areas that banks need to address.
Jean Lassignardie, Global Head of Sales and Marketing, Capgemini Financial Services comments on the findings: Banks should be applauded for taking the necessary, initial steps to sustain customer relationships, he says.

For example- you are eating something
very fair cuz its maps mass is very fair in it like you never see him at Sage going yep 6
That is amongst the largest, if not the largest at a single center annually
Our philosophy is that one size does not fit all
That is our experts look at each patient as a unique individual, and look at their situation, and give them the best recommendation, and best treatment option for their disease
Our experts are well versed on surgery, but also on non-surgical treatments for prostate cancer
[MUSIC] We perform about 600 robotic prostatectomies here at Johns Hopkins annually
Weve had a robot here at Hopkins since the year 2000 longer than most institutions in this country and around the world
FREDERICK CROSBY: Come to eBay.
Thats a natural one.
As weve seen, if else statements really give you control over your code.
In fact, Lyme disease has many, many, many more symptoms and its known as the great mimicker
It can mimic something like 300 different diseases and so classically can fit that
If we do a Google search and we look at what are the potential causes for fibromyalgia syndrome, youll find illness, hormones, trauma, stress, but really that doesnt tell us anything, because we see that typically with every chronic Lyme disease patient
Is it important to have an integrated campaign?
I would say definitely it is.
I think it’s important in the past, probably, you know, the challenge was to try to get on line where it was echoing kind of the off line message.
There’s a number of reasons, first of all of course, economically, intellectual property is extremely important for Europe.
But also for China, ironically, because both Europe and China on one hand are countries of old civilization, which have creativity, which have inventions.
And they do not have raw materials so their economy has to develop what the brains produce as opposed to what the earth produces, if you want to compare.
And therefore, one way or another, you go through intellectual property, be it for trademarks, be it for patents for technologies, be it for copyrights for artists, or be it for geographical indications.
Hi, Its Lisa Treu with the Treu Group and we sold another property in Jupiter Farms.
The Treu Group is having an amazing success in the farms and we would love to help you, too; if youre thinking of selling.
We actually listed this property for two hundred and seventy-five thousand which the seller was just shocked that they could get that much.
We actually sold it for two hundred and seventy-eight thousand Their property was sold in four days with multiple offers.
I believe entrepreneurship is the ability to think and create something that you would like to do in the world and try to make money doing it.
Where you kind of submit to and commit to a lifestyle where you think that the best idea around deserves to come to the top and that youll kind of will it into action no matter what.
The freedom to follow your dreams, to work with people that you like to work with.
To me it was a just kinda being your own boss and taking a little more control over your own destiny.
Entrepreneurship is about spotting a problem, spotting a need, and figuring out how to address that and then how to convince those people with that problem, with that need, that you have the solution.

Im ASIC Commissioner John Price There has been a lot of reporting on ASICs investigation into the share trading of David Jones two directors and the proposal from Myer.
ASIC has examined this matter thoroughly, including this proposal and decided there is insufficient evidence to take enforcement action.
This decision is not an exoneration or a tick of approval and if more evidence comes to light, the matter can be re-opened.
Generally, there are four things ASIC must prove for any insider trading case.
First, you need to show traders actually had the information.
Second, the information needs to be inside information so it was not generally known to the rest of the market.
Third, that the information was material in that it would have a material effect on the price or value of the companys shares.
And last, ASIC needs to prove the trader knew or ought to have known the information was material and not publicly available.
Proving all of these things is generally a very hard thing to do.
So with insider trading, ASIC will use its powers to look at all information, and interview all key people.
We also use independent experts who have experience in the markets, particularly on materiality.
And thats because dairy milk requires about 12 times as much water as almond milk and thats something that people dont always consider
We know that almonds do take a lot of water to grow, but dairy farms use 12 times as much water
And of course that water isnt just the water that the cows are drinking, its the water that goes into growing the crops that those cows are going to to eat and this doesnt even include the untold amount of water that is required to keep dairies clean, because a dairy farm of 2,500 produces as much waste as a city of 411,000 people
So 2500 dairy cows produce as much waste as 411,000 people
Hey everyone, this is Bill Peters here from Investors Business Daily, giving you a quick, live intraday market update.
The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are both down fractionally while the Nasdaq is up fractionally.
Oil stocks in general today struggled but things look better for parts of the biotech and pharmaceutical industries.
Wait, that doesnt make any sense


In fact, they go on to explain that
Its true that under a scheme like the one Sanders envisions, most people would lose the insurance they have today
But thats because everybody would have the new government-provided insurance instead
The whole point of a single-payer plan is to make sure that coverage is simpler, more comprehensive, and more reliable than it is today
 She also does another sleazy trick there
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians.
Today I wanna introduce the idea of the verb tense, and the way I wanna do that is to express the following, if you can master grammatical tenses, you will become a time wizard, a literal, actual time wizard because tense is nothing more than the ability of verbs to situate themselves in time, specifically in three different times so in the past, the present, or the future it can happen.
When were talking about a verb, a verb can happen now, a verb can happen later, and a verb can have happened in the past, then.
My name is Julie Asti and I am a Certified Financial Planner with Asti Financial Management and I am here to talk about how to estimate how much money you will need to retire.
Estimating how much money you are going to need to retire on is really kind of a complex calculation and it is really tough to do on your own.
You definitely would probably need the services or to use some kind of an on line tool because there is going to be projections that you are definitely going to have to be doing but really when you are looking at how much you need to retire there are, it is kind of a simple equation that you start out with.
Im going to tell you a personal story about myself
When I was in college, Rostropovich came from the Soviet Union, that was the Soviet Union in those days, he came to the Los Angeles Philharmonic and I was going to University of Southern California and I was studying with Piatagorsky then
So all the cellists heard that this great Russian cellist was coming and we went we heard him play Sinfonia Concertante of Prokofiev that night

The three key trends that I see coming up more and more in campaigns, I think overwhelmingly the number one, and it sort of [INAUD] everything is two way communication.
And it’s something we talked about today at the Think Politics event.
But I think overwhelmingly people are looking to engage in on line, but also be engaged with.
So it’s not just that they’re looking for on line as a place of information, they’re looking to actually get back and have some sort of active engagement and activity with an organization.
It causes me to not do bad and put myself in a bad situation
The key to any business successful plan is the situation analysis.
It doesnt sound very sexy, but, think of it as wearing a you were here sign, this is where you start.
If you dont do the situation analysis effectively, theres no way you can come up with effective strategy.
Wow!! Thats really all I can say about the book I read this week

- Lets take a look at the cell cycle.
The cell cycle is the entire life cycle of a cell that includes possibly mitosis or nuclear division.
If we were to throw the stages of the cell cycle on to a little circular image, what you would see is that the cell is in a stage called interphase most of the time.
All of that is interphase.
Interphase is essentially where the cell is doing its thing.
Hanging out being a cell.
There are specific characteristics.
For example, during interphase the cells DNA looks like this.
Dude, I feel like Ive got Barkley the dog from Sesame Street hanging out here with me.
So most of the time that a cell is hanging out, its in interphase.

Were here talk now about hour 18, Texts J and K
And Greg, I was wondering these are part of the text I each of them
And what do you think is new and different that you separated these parts out as separate focused passages? Well, what I want to emphasize about Text J, which is part of the Text I, it is this privileged position of Theseus as not only the founding hero of Athens as understood by the democracy in the 5th century, a version of the city of Athens but also his role as the initiator of all Athenians into what is called the Eleusinian Mysteries
The reference to looking and hearing in a special way and which also involves not looking and not hearing, or can I say not visualizing and not verbalizing in other ways, is just pure mystery
Its the way an initiator initiates worshippers into mysteries
And thats why I want to come back to this part and try to make it understandable in terms of the fifth century of Athens, which was a very sophisticated period in the history of the city, but which is still clinging to these fundamental notions of what is a cult hero
What is it like to be initiated into the mysteries of a cult hero? And how does that have to do with my role and your role as a citizen in [INAUDIBLE]? Thats what this is all about and thats what, certainly, Sophocles is concentrating on and thats why hes so fascinated with Theseus
And the flip side is thats also why hes so fascinated with Oedipus himself who is a character that he has brought to life in other aspects of that characters life
But here, in Oedipus at Colonus, Sophocles, whos in his 90s, really identifies with this wretched old man and how hes struggling with the difficulties of old age and the prospect of dying
I can just bet that the citizens of Athens as they thought about Sophocles towards the end of the 5th century would have thought about how the old man and his very, very long career, which is full of sufferings as well as successes, could be identified with Oedipus as a cult hero
And thats why at the end, Im asking myself, well, who is the referent here? The man did not need lamentations and there were no diseases that gave him any pain at the moment when he was escorted away
But what Marx saw was that just as we freed ourselves from these natural constraints, we entangled ourselves in new social constraints
Lets go to the Thought Bubble to explore this some more
Think about it like this
Ten thousand years ago, basically everybody spent all day trying to get food
In this primitive communism, as Marx called it, people were strongly bound by natural constraints, but socially very equal

But you also have the peasantry, who still worked constantly, making food
In fact, they spent a lot of their time making food for the nobility

- So what actually is personal branding? You hear people saying brand yourself and have a personal brand, but knowing actually what it is and how to do it is another story
So I am Tori from torimackle

That is what I am going to talk about today
So when you brand yourself, you are at the centre of your business
Not your products, not the things that you recommend, but actually you
So you probably heard this before, people actually relate to people and not businesses or companies
So with a personal brand, you can build a following of people that know, like and trust you
And when people trust you, theyre now more likely to listen to your recommendations and want to know what it is that you are doing and how they can get the same thing or what it is what you are recommending because they trust that if they listen to you, they are going to get the solutions that they are after and its the solutions that are the most important
With a personal brand, it doesnt matter what happens with social media or any company that you are associated with or any products that you recommend because you are at the centre of your business
So it doesnt matter what happens with those things because your business is always going to be long term and sustainable if it is about you and your personal brand
Everything else is like spokes that come off this central point which is you
Now, it may or may not be a surprise to you that you actually already have a personal brand
Your personal brand really is about your values and what you stand for and showing people that
So people can have a personal brand that actually dont have a business
If youve got a lot of people that look up to you as an authority in a certain area, as a leader in some description, then you probably already have a personal brand
So a personal brand really is what you are known for by other people
So what do other people say about you? What do other people say that you do for a living? Those are the things that are actually represented in a personal brand
Now, personal brands can actually open a whole bunch of doors for you and if you make your personal brand official and make it a business, then you can actually monetize those opportunities which is what is super exciting about a personal brand and it is really something that you build overtime
A personal brand isnt something that you can not have one day and have the next day
You might make it more official, but you actually dont create a personal brand that doesnt already exist within you
So that is my message for today
If you would like to leave your biggest takeaway message in the comments that you would be great
I love to hear what you guys think and pop over to my blog torimackle
- So when looking at financial aid opportunities the first thing I looked at were scholarships.
I applied to a lot and basically just did a quick Google search of scholarships that pertained to things that I was interested in.
Applied to as many as I could, that was, you know, humanly feasible, and then I actually ended up getting a couple.
Hi there.
[Jazzy hip-hop music] If theres one thing that storytelling teaches us about life, its that different objectives require different tactics, that achieve different results

One thing always leads to another
Applying this theme to marketing reveals at least one universal truth: at the beginning of any project, make sure your entire team, especially the final stakeholders and decision-makers, are all seeing the same objective as the end goal
If you have different and conflicting objectives, youre gonna look for different tactics to achieve different results, and youre setting yourself up for incoherence
Let me give you a hypothetical
Lets imagine that we have a client together, and their goal is to sell their product online to 15-21 year old men on YouTube

Thats a clear objective
We lay out a 180 day strategy
We start creating daily content on YouTube for them
Sales start to go up, and they can see that the conversion is coming from the audience on YouTube
But then as we get towards the end of the schedule, the end of the strategy, someone remarks, We dont like that the number of subscribers to our YouTube channel isnt as high as wed like it to be
 Or, We dont like that there arent more people coming from YouTube to our other social channels as wed like there to be
 Those notes provide an excellent opportunity to pivot towards new goals, but they were never the target objective
The target objective was to sell to 18-21 year old men on YouTube
But at the end, not everyones measuring success the same way
When your team all has the same objective in mind and is measuring success the exact same way, that becomes your North Star
It makes hard choices so much easier
It allows you to assess so much easier going forward
If youre aiming for 18-20 year old men, and the only people engaging with your content are 35-50 year old women, hmm, somethings weird
Weve gotta pivot here
Regrettably, the United States has published the names of the Russian citizens who will face visa and financial sanctions in accordance with the absurd Magnitsky Act.

Hello Google, Hello People, and Hello Local Guides My name is Kim, and im a Master Student Researcher in The National University of Malaysia (UKM) Why i want to be a Local Guide?
Before coming that we normally have these questions in our mind, all the time Thankfully the Google Local Guides comes with Google Maps Integration First, we can use Google Maps to search Foods around Us (Foods Around Me in Google Maps keywords) and it will populates all the list of attractions, reviews and the ratings That information is important for us to decide which places were trying to go, were heading to And we use Google Maps to navigate us to the place directly And another reason is, i like to travel.
This is financial adviser Patrick Munro talking about what is a sector fund.
The first thing that we have to do is stress interest and relevance, and basically when I talk about interest and relevance; Im talking about what you know about your audience.
I think consumers in the health care space want to see advertising from companies, organizations, their local hospital or physician, thats relevant to them.
The best way to improve your pitch, is practice.
And after you finish practice, you practice some more.
I want to find out about Payne gas furnace consumer reviews.
This is your lucky day, oh Danny boy, I know quite a bit about Payne gas furnace consumer reviews.
Excellent, so what can you tell me?
Well, if you considering the purchase of Payne gas furnace, only 41 percent of consumers have a favorable opinion of them.
That is certainly off putting.
What sort of things do they say about the furnace?
They say that the furnace, while affordable, often breaks and that the parts are often not covered under warranty, with little help from Payne.
Although some consumers point to the fact that the furnace is a reliable, it just depends on who you choose to listen to I guess.
SAM TRUJILLO: Well the value digital marketing today, is digital marketing is simply a marketing channel.
What Speakers Do Part 1 of 4 Before we can teach speaking to language learners, we need to understand the speaking process for native speakers and realize ways it is different from writing, which is also a production skill.
This is a four part video series looking at what native speakers naturally do and how this knowledge can assist language learners.
LetÕs begin by looking at spontaneity.
Spontaneity Both writing and talking involve an audience, but in writing, the audience either does not respond directly to the author or does so long after the writing has occurred.
In speaking, there is immediate feedback.
For the purposes of this lecture series, I want to just consider conversation and not public speaking which has more similarities to writing.
SoÉas I was saying, conversation offers immediate feedback because the listener will respond with words or actions based upon what we said.
This interlocutor, the person we are talking with, may ask a question or offer words of encouragement.
The speaker needs to answer the question or encouragement while continuing with the information they are sharing.
Alright, hello business students!
This is Professor Nance.
So this week were going to be looking at a topic  that should be of interest to those of you who have thought about or have previously dealt with owning or helping manage a business, and that is forms of business ownership.
So this is a very core and important part of understanding small business and any business about how do we structurally and legally set up a business to start with.
﻿If your company is growing
If youre adding more people to your team, or if youve just already got a decent sized business
Then youre probably thinking a lot about how your company can have more effective meetings
And what kind of meetings your company should be having
And thats what I want to talk about in this video
So a couple months back, at the recommendation of some friends, I spent about a month diving into the best resources on meetings
Three books that I got were Patrick Lencioni Death by Meeting
Cameron Harolds, Meetings Suck
And then I spent a lot of time reading the chapter on meetings in Scaling Up
I believe it was either Scaling Up, or Retraction
Both of those books have stuff on meetings
And at the end of the day, what I found is that all fast-growing companies that are successful have a regular rhythm, and are in a really cohesive structure for how they are meeting
They dont just willy-nilly have meetings at random times
They have daily company meetings
They have weekly company meetings
They have different one-on-one meetings
They have different quarterly meetings
And the meetings are happening with a real rhythm and a real structure
Like I said, not just randomly
So what we ended up doing in our company
People ask me about this a lot
Is that we have most of our meetings on Monday
So on Mondays, each of our business areas has a one-hour weekly action review meeting
I attend two of those meetings every Monday
And then all of our one-on-one meetings happen weekly on Mondays as well
So all of my direct reports, I meet with each of them for up to an hour
Its usually more like a half an hour every Monday
So its a lot of meetings on Mondays but you really get to set the week off in the right way
You get to start the week on the right foot and then the rest of your week is clear to work on the priorities and the goals, and the projects that you set for yourself at the beginning of the week
And then throughout the rest of the week, we do a few different things
We have daily huddles that are about 15 minutes long, sometimes less, depending on the number of people in them
And well have a couple of different ones
We have a leader huddle which is for the leaders in the company, our senior leadership
And then each business area has a huddle each day
And myself and our CEO, we will bounce in and out of different meetings each day
So on one day, I will attend a meeting with our training division
On the next day, I might be with customer service
On the next day, I might be with marketing etc
And then on Wednesdays, we have a one-hour company-wide meeting
Its the only meeting we have in our company that is everybody in the company for one hour
And there are a lot of businesses
If youre a little bit smaller than we are, who have company-wides daily
They will have a daily huddle that has everybody in the company
But we have 25 people in our company right now as Im recording this
And it just isnt effective
I think if you have over ten people in your company, having a daily company-wide just becomes a little bit inefficient
So reach out to me if you have any questions about any of this, or leave a comment under this video
Id be happy to give you any thoughts on this
Its something that has really, really energized our company
We have a great rhythm now where we know every day what meetings are happening, when
And a really specific structure for how these meetings are conducted
And Ill tell you, everybody on our team that has really loved it and its made us a lot more productive

In this clip were going to cover tips to perfect your dialogue.
Now you know that each character is going to speak a little bit differently from each other based on their background, who they are, their personality.
But when you take one particular character, that one character is also going to speak differently based on other people that hes encountering.

Instead, we brought students to our campus.
Good day.
Im Dr. Charles Grimes, and Im speaking today on behalf of Expert Village about finding a theatrical monologue for use in auditions.
Let me tell you about what monologues you shouldnt do.
This is a challenge for all actors.
Today I am pleased to release my Recommended FY17 Operating Budget of $5.3 billion for the year that begins on July 1, 2016. This budget does two big things.
It increases County spending on the Montgomery County Public Schools by almost $136 million ($90 million over Maintenance of Effort) and It addresses a $50 million loss to County revenues caused by the Wynne court case.
The budget closes an estimated $178 million gap.
Over the last ten years, I have closed over $3.3 billion in budget gaps while putting the County’s fiscal house back in order and making the investments necessary to build a better future.
Lighting the lamp of learning is the most important thing we can do.
Our public schools have been funded at, or below, the level defined as ‘Maintenance of Effort’ since FY 09. On a per-pupil basis, funding has not increased.
We are adding 2000-plus students a year.
Class sizes have grown.
There has not been sufficient progress in closing the achievement gap that exists between many of our minority students and non-minority students.
I believe we must provide the Superintendent and the Board of Education with additional funding to further address these challenges.
To do this, my proposed property tax rate increase is 3.9 cents above the current rate.
The average tax bill (for a house assessed at $464,000) increases by about $27 a month or $325 annually.
Hey everyone happy Friday this is Alissa Williams with your final market update for the week.

For many years I sat in church and would hear the pastors sermon.
We would learn the reason we do not hear from God clearly is because of all the distractions and all the noise of our culture.
But what I did not know until the Holy Spirit taught me, was that unless you are willing to rid yourself of all the distractions, you will NOT hear from the Holy Spirit clearly.
MOST people do NOT hear from GOD, let alone obey Him.
If you cannot hear from Him, HOW can you follow Him and obey Him?
And if you are not obeying Him you cannot possibly be pleasing to Him.
It starts with a relationship with Him in prayer, seeking Him in private.
You dont have to tell other people that you are going to go and pray, or you dont have to go into a church building to do it.
You just find a quite place, go on your knees and pray.
If you cannot actually be on your knees in prayer, you can take a walk and you can pray, but just find a place that you are NOT distracted.
There are so many distractions and people are not willing to get those out of their life.
They like to say, Everything in moderation, that is what was taught by the pastor in church.
They would say, The TV is a distraction, everything in moderation as long as you dont watch it too much... maybe only watch it a couple times a week instead of every day. They are lying to you.
All right, so it sounds like he gave me a lot of detail on this one, so this is a pretty easy one for me, but Im going to give you a little bit of a general advice because I know most of you guys are in New York City and youre going to, at the same time, be going to engagement parties and youve got a question of, What should I wear
 The first thing that you want to ask yourself is what is the dress code
And if its a higher end affair like this one, then most likely there is going to be a dress code because it sounds like its going to be a catered event at a big banquet hall
dudes around, they have their particular outfit, and the handmaids outfit is both iconic and visually striking and so they are supposed to wear all read, this big shapeless shift thing, and then they wear a bonnet
but the bonnet, when theyre outside, has these things that are referred to as wings, and its this white like cone kind of thing
They kind of show it on the cover of the book, this is like one persons interpretation of it
The interpretation of it at the show works so well visually

Philosophy wouldn’t be any fun if the key to knowledge were that easy, right
Until American philosopher Edmund Gettier came along in the 1960s, philosophers were in pretty widespread agreement about the definition of knowledge -- that it’s justified true belief

Hello, my name is Merita.
I am married to Festim Qelemeni and we have 4 children.
We are from Elbasan and came to Tirana 5 years ago, and we pastor the church  House of the Prayer, located in Bregu I Lumit, Tirana.
When Nita came for the first time to visit our church, my life was a rush from one corner to another, running from one ministry to another to find pleasure mostly for myself.
When Nita came and shared her story, God touched my life especially through the seminar  Who I am in Christ. There is a verse, Proverbs 28:13 that taught me how to confess the secrets of my past so I could be released and healed.
Well I think the good news is a government wide agressive assistance program is very much under way and things get better each and every day.
The logistics were pretty tough getting supplies, getting people into Haiti, annd that has gotten better today.

We at HHS have had just under 300 people on the ground in medical teams, in mortuary teams who have been assisting identifying and processing of the remains of victims and we have folks who have been assisting in the search and rescue mission.

Which distribution channels, such as brick and mortar stores and e-commerce sites, should I use?
How can I take advantage of each step in the sales process to boost sales?
The best you could do with $1,000 is take Uber everywhere for a week
Also, I love that he thinks the first thing a middle-class family would do with $1,000 is renovate their kitchen

Why dont I take us all to the movies


President Obama: Good afternoon everybody
Over the last several days the United States has been responding to events as they unfold in Ukraine
Now throughout this crisis we have been very clear about one fundamental principle: the Ukrainian people deserve the opportunity to determine their own future
Together with our European allied, we have urged an end to the violence and encouraged Ukrainians to pursue a course in which they stabilize their country, forge a broad-based government, and move to elections this spring
I also spoke several days ago with President Putin - and my administration has been in daily communication with Russian officials - and weve made clear that they can be part of an international communities effort to support the stability and success of a united Ukraine going forward, which is not only in the interests of the people of Ukraine and the international community, but also in Russias interest
However, we are now deeply concerned by reports of military movements taken by the Russian Federation inside Ukraine
Russia has a historic relationship with Ukraine, including cultural and economic ties and a military facility in Crimea
But any violation of Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity would be deeply destabilizing, which is not in the interest of Ukraine, Russia, or Europe
It would represent a profound interference in matters that must be determined by the Ukrainian people
It would be a clear violation of Russias commitment to respect the independence and sovereignty and borders of Ukraine, and of international laws
And just days after the world came to Russia for the olympic games it would invite the condemnation of nations around the world
And, indeed, the United States will stand with the international community in affirming that there will be costs for any military intervention in Ukraine
The events of the past several months remind us of how difficult democracy can be in a country with deep divisions
But the Ukrainian people have also reminded us that human beings have a universal right to determine their own future
Right now the situation remains very fluid
Vice President Biden just spoke with the Prime Minister of Ukraine to assure him that in this difficult moment the United States supports his governments efforts and stands for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and democratic future of Ukraine
I also commend the Ukrainian governments restraint
And its commitment to uphold its international obligations
We will continue to coordinate closely with our European allies
We will continue to communicate directly with the Russian government
And we will continue to keep all of you in the press corps and the American people informed as events develop
more than I ever have, to eat healthily
Because eating healthy is something that I have struggled with my entire life because I have a partiality to really unhealthy foods and, as I said before, I find it really hard to stick to a new routine and cutting bad foods out of my diet, is a new routine
But since that conversation, I have been eating significantly healthier
I mean, I havent cut down completely on cows milk because i prefer the taste of cows milk to almond milk and Im not a vegan
However, this got me thinking, I guess, about the value of impulse versus reason and logic and consideration
Not long ago I talked with a reporter about a client facing an uphill battle against an entrenched incumbent.
The reporter asked me an interesting question.
“Why did you take a client that has no chance of winning?” She asked.
This was my answer.
My client has something to say that needs to be said.
She has things to say that no one else is going to say.
She has a cause to advance that no one else will.
No one better illustrates that example than Senator Bernie Sanders.
He was considered a fringe candidate when he announced.
Nobody gave him a chance of winning anything.
been thinking about the debate that always, you know, gets rehashed each time the minimum wage proposal is put on the table
&gt;&gt; Yes I believe it is very important.
One of the problems that the Middle East is suffering from is how many young people do we have, and the amount of despair and lack of role models that exist.
I think the role models play a key role in setting the stage and agenda for a world that can hopefully be more peaceful hopefully and more ethical.
I think people are looking at todays leaders and we are brutally disappointed or feel lost.
There is no clarity of an election, for them to inspire to be like.
I graduated high school 1973 I went to Rutgers University for two years
I ran out of money, it was classic
I was one of five
My dad is a police officer there were no parental scholarships
I went down to this warehouse on the edge of Newark Airport called Wakefern and applied for a job and I became a teamster
Local 863 and I was receiving selecting and shipping the loads that were going up toour non-foods
I examined a lot of leaders and Wakefern I was fortunate Wakefern as a lot of great leaders, and I took a little bit of each of their story about respect or communication or clarity or just being in the moment
And, you take that and you make that part of your story and your narrative as you go forward
And, there were a lot of mentors and a lot of leaders that were willing to take their time both formally and informally and guide us forward
Create a story that others are going to tell about you
Most of your career when youre in high school and college youre telling your story to get that next level
Once youre in a workplace others are going to tell your story and make sure that story of something that you want to hear
&gt;&gt; My name is Aaron McCormack.
half as many children, which helps to explain why immigration from Latin America has been dropping for years
In 2011 the number of people moving from Mexico to the United States was about the same as the number moving from the United States to Mexico

You can see the birth rates fall to US levels and sometimes below
At the same time you can watch the GDP per capita of these countries triple
Latin America now has a workforce that is growing at a slower pace
At the same time, this work force has many new opportunities
When the US economy recovers, large-scale Latino immigration will not
The people necessary to restart the immigration boom are simply not there
Nobody in Washington DC, Democrat or Republican, is willing to acknowledge the simple fact
I am Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter,   the man who first brought his own brother to the Lord.
I am not a gifted man, but just an ordinary, average man,   like any one of you.
But Ive tried to do what I could to serve the Master   with the gifts and talents that I have.
The others call me Andrew the Bringer,   because it seems that all I have ever done is to bring someone else to Jesus.
I brought my brother Peter to Jesus,  and have gloried in the gradual transformation in his life.

I remember being raised religious
I dont feel like it damaged me
I think I learned a lot of things that were untrue
I think a lot of Christians-- ex Christians would agree with that, too, but it didnt hurt me
I felt good being religious because I thought my values and morals were in the right place
So, how could that be abusive in any way

Yeah, I think thats a form of child abuse
I think if youre allowing your kids to die because prayers are going to save them, thats abuse
Hi, my name is Veronica Baragas with my WigglesandGiggles.com, and Id like to share with you today about starting a daycare business plan.
Were afraid to be depleted, and so we dont give
We equate being a giver solely with that second type

I was inspired by anthropologist Robin Dunbar, who says that the number of people with whom you can maintain stable, ongoing social interaction is approximately 150

MR TONER: We are concerned that another Maldivian opposition leader has been sentenced to a lengthy prison term after a deeply flawed and – judicial process.
Opposition leader Sheikh Imran was sentenced yesterday to 12 years in prison for speaking at an opposition rally.
&gt;&gt; So India can clearly be a superpower, its a question of how and when rather than if.
And we need to find out what we are doing like many other countries have done that, which means we need to set the right foundation, we need to identify whats our competitive advantage, make sure that we build on those.
And very clearly we have many weaknesses as well which need to work out.
Not an easy task, but then something thats good and Im sure all of us here in India are raring to go.
Studies have shown that the more engaged a company is internationally, the more productive it is.
European companies who are already invested in California stand to benefit especially from T-TIP both directly and indirectly.
But maybe you can help us thinking about this
Because what I have in mind is a civil dialogue
Not a civil debate because in a debate you try to convince the other of your opinion
But in a dialogue you really listen to the other person in order to really understand him or her
And in this way we can formulate a response to the decision of the European court as a country
And we don’t have to agree on everything, but we just all have to feel comfortable about it
And maybe you can help
But then the question is: How do you start a dialogue like that
Well, let me start the dialogue and then you can continue it by thinking about my opinion and by responding to it
Let’s start with the question why we have the life imprisonment sentence
There are actually two reasons
MATTHEW SHADBOLT: I think ultimately I do believe that speed beats perfection because coming from the online perspective, the ability to iterate, adjust, and change things that are not perfect and essentially make them perfect over time is essentially how its always worked.
And its a key part of working with anything online, I think, is the ability to refine the product over however long a period of time.
Advertisings probably gotten smarter, and more aggressive, and more subtle over the last five or ten years.
I think creativity is more pronounced in advertisements now.
I would say its gotten a lot more liberal in content.
Advertising has shifted from mostly a television format to online, banner ad-type format.
Advertising has gotten a lot more aggressive over the last five or ten years.
People approaching you in the streets.
they were called all manner of names like sissy, girly, et cetera, et cetera
And this was a thing that we had a bit of a conversation about before shooting the episode
The people involved in that conversation all had really different experiences and my personal experience, as someone who was called no shortage of terrible names growing up, was that the people using those insults didnt see me necessarily as referencing another gender in my actions but rather saw femininity as an insult to hurl at a young boy
That it wasnt that I was being girly but that girliness was an insult, which I realize is maybe kind of like splitting hairs
But, of course, that doesnt mean that other people have had exactly that experience and so there was definitely room for more nuance when we made that point
Hi and welcome to the Tuesday Tip! We are in the middle of the gift giving season
Have you treated your loved ones or yourself to a Genius Ultra? How rewarding would it be to give your mom, your sister, your brother or your best friend the gift of beautiful, youthful-looking skin in 2017? Todays Tuesday Tip is about which products work best with your Genius Ultra and which ones to avoid
The good news is that most Arbonne skincare products are perfect pairs to use with your Genius Ultra
Here on my left are some products we recommend you use with the Genius Ultra
Youll see some RE9, some Calm some RE9 Advanced for Men and some body products! Youre good to go! There are so many products outside of just what is here that you can use with your Genius Ultra
Now on my right is a different story
These are products we recommend you not use together with your Genius Ultra
And Ill tell you why Dont use with products that contain SPF
This is any day cream or moisturizer which says SPF on the front panel
The efficacy of the SPF can be compromised if used together because of the chemical or mineral sunscreen composition
However, we do recommend using an SPF after you finish the Genius Ultra during the day
Just dont use them together
Then theres acne products
This include the entire Clear Future Collection
Because this collection includes the active salicylic acid, its recommended that you not use this together with your Genius Ultra
Last but not least, are products you would normally use with water
This includes cleansers, shaving creams, rinse-off masks
The Genius Ultra cannot be submerged or put under running water
So its best to steer clear when using these types of products with your Genius Ultra
Now, if youre hesitant about how your skin will react to the Genius Ultra with specific Arbonne products, we recommend you test them together on the inside part of your forearm
Wait 24 hours and check for any adverse reaction
If theres no reaction, then youre probably safe to use these products together with your Genius Ultra
I hope this helps clear up any questions that you had
Hi Im Tom McGovern, the President of Rockford Construction and were a full service construction manager general contractor Cascade engineering is a manufacture of plastic injection molding parts.
weve been in business for four years and weve been doing sustainability for four years before it was called sustainability.
Over the past two years weve been very very a successful in growing our business to pre-recession levels we added approximately 40 members to our group we found that the talent that was available in the market was exceptional and were very excited about that opportunity.
recently weve been able to accomplish a lot of things in two years time frame.
TOBY ALFRED: Certainly over this last year where the message of you have to save money has been hammered into consumers-- Virtually every news show talked about saving money was essential and shopping for your auto insurance.
So we were very fortunate and were able to capitalize on that because we had a savings message out that the public was hearing.
A few weeks ago the Governor of the Reserve Bank pointed out that New Zealand will in the next 12 months be one of the faster-growing developed economies.
I know it doesnt quite feel like that here.
We find the recovery is becoming increasingly positive but is still a bit patchy where some industries and businesses are still struggling and certainly there are still people looking for jobs.
But it does tell us a bit about whats happening in the rest of the world.
I was in Australia just last week and theres a mood there of some frustration, I think.
Theyve had decades with no recession, theyre going through a bit of an adjustment and Ive been a bit surprised at how much that has affected the legendary Australian confidence.
In the next few weeks Ill be off to Singapore and Vietnam - part of that Asia-Pacific rim which is growing so fast.
Theyve got some economic challenges too at the moment with the large emerging markets slowing down.
The hot money that flowed in there a few years ago is starting to flow back to the US and that is a risk for New Zealand.
My name is Supa Mandiwanzira.
Focus on understanding consumers and consumer insights.
Really, really a depth of understanding with our consumers is one of the biggest ways that we catalyze great creativity.
And then I think within the organization, giving people the opportunity to try new and innovative approaches and make mistakes even.
And really giving people room to grow in that experience and take chances, I think, really does foster great creativity.
There’s certainly many things from our heritage in creative development that continue to be very important, lots of discipline and clarity of strategy are absolutely critical as well.
A new study from Accenture and the Federation of Enterprises found that European employers are scaling back on employee development and training programs.
Over the past year, nearly 90% of European employees have either cut their budgets for training programs or discontinued spending altogether.
and talk about what you learned from reading what your students do, or looking at it if its not textual material
So thats the one I know the best
I find certain kinds of conferences or workshops that people give would to me be a form of scholarship
It depends a bit on the content but I could imagine being asked to review someone for promotion based on Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, and in that packet, I might get an article, I might get a link to a course portfolio, I might get a PowerPoint and a set of handouts from a workshop
And if I read that PowerPoint and those handouts, I could very well determine if that person was doing thoughtful, informed, evidence based scholarship
Call me corny,  Everyone knows that buying a home is impossible once you file bankruptcy.
And that is one dream Im not willing to sacrifice.
but Ive always dreamed of a quant house with a white picket fence and pristine grass since I was a little kid.
And while my dream of home ownership is still a bit down the road due to debt and other financial problems, one thing is for certain: I am never going to file bankruptcy.
everyone knows that viacom is it possible once you file bankruptcy and atleast one drink Everyone knows that buying a home is impossible  once you file bankruptcy.
And that is one dream  Im not willing to sacrifice.
In determing  why youre going to be able to get financing on a home after bankruptcy its important to  understand what banks consider when determining whether or not to loan you money.
and probably the most important factor that they considered hazardous income ratio in And probably the most important factor that  they consider is your debt to income ratio.
other words how much outstanding debt you have relative to the income that you have In other words, how much outstanding debt you  have relative to the income that you have  to support those debt payments.
but generally they lender wants you to make it more gives payment no greater than thirty Now generally, a lender wants you to make  a mortgage payment no greater than thirty  percent of your gross monthly income.
So lets put this in perspective:  Right now look at how much debt you have relative to your income.
It it greater than thirty percent?
Before I received the baptism of the Holy Spirit with FIRE in my life, I had NO POWER.
The Holy Spirit gives us POWER.
He gives us power to overcome sin, and He gives us power to proclaim the gospel of Jesus, to win souls into the Kingdom.
Before I received the Holy Spirit, I was passionate about God and I would tell people about God but I didn’t win a single soul into the Kingdom of Heaven, I didn’t win them for Jesus.
I won a few people to church, but I didn’t win anyone to Jesus.
I was religions since I was young and passionate like so many Christians are, but I’ll tell you one thing, UNLESS YOU ARE ABIDING IN JESUS AND HAVE RECEIVED HIS HOLY SPIRIT GUIDANCE YOU CAN DO NOTHING!
All right, the last thing you do in a eulogy--and Im going to use a certain word and its not going to make any sense to you--but you toast the person.
Now Im not talking about in the sense of raise your glass and take a drink.
But a toast to a person in a eulogy are your last thoughts on their life, and you must touch on the afterlife.
Okay, you dont have to belabor the point, but you want to talk about the future of the deceased.
blood sugars decrease, my blood pressure decreases, my body relaxes a little bit which in turn signals to my brain that were not under attack
One of the ways to break this cycle of mind - body and back and forth, notice when my jaw is tense, to actually unlock it
When my hands are clenched, release them
If I find that my neck is tight, relaxing it, stretching it, which will in turn send a signal to my mind that were OK
 We are really okay
One of the things you can do, is you can find people who will actually listen to you
Now lets talk about spontaneity, and when Im talking about spontaneity, I mean being spontaneous.

Sometimes, posting a TED talk about the subject, or an inspiring article can motivate students to stay engaged
Even an image, a meme, or a funny cartoon can keep your Team space alive
By posting even loosely connected ideas on Teams, youre encouraging a safe space for students to learn the same
Likes are a form of recognizing that the teacher and or students have seen that post
This is great for teacher announcements, student suggestions, or questions
Teachers can also suggest a live meeting with just one click of the meet now button at the bottom right of a conversation
Tracking consumer cash flow as an indicator of future consumer spending, the Deloitte Consumer Spending Index (Index) posted its fourth consecutive increase in June.
Home prices are stabilizing and even turning up in some markets.
Record low interest rates are giving a small boost to demand and helping to increase refinancing activity.
Most refinances are being done for a lower payment as there is little equity to be cashed out.
Alison Paul, vice chairman, Deloitte LLP and retail &amp; distribution sector leader comments: Retailers can capitalize on changing consumer behavior, such as embracing shoppers use of mobile technology in the store, she said.
Hi, I’m Marty and I’d like to help you take control of your financial future and share the three keys of wealth with you.
Did you know saving for a home deposit, paying off your mortgage faster, investing and Superannuation is really easy!
Then you might ask; If it’s so easy?
Why isn’t everybody doing it?
Simply because everyone who has tried investing skips the basics!
Most investors think investing is about trust.
How can I trust that person?
Im Jack Johnstun from Integrated Accounting here in Ogden, Utah.
I get asked all the time from people that come in just off the street wondering if they pay too much tax.
Mostly small business people wondering if they pay too much tax.
Hi everyone, hope youre doing well.
Melissa here, CloudMom.com.
Back in my bathroom talking today about buying for babies.
Read a very very interesting piece in the New York Times Motherlode blog by KJ--I can never get this name right, DellAntonia, love that name.
I want to know what the KJ stands for--talking about when moms buy for their babies and how there can be a tendency to buy too much.
I think this blog is so fascinating.
Theres a doctor interviewed in the blog, her name is Dr. Jennifer Trachtenberg.
And heres what she says.
She says that when moms get stressed, they buy.
They buy because they think its gonna to make baby care easier.
Okay, this was me in a nutshell.
When I was pregnant for the first time, I started calling up friends of mine who had babies and making lists of everything I needed from the big to the small.
From the stroller, the crib, the carseat... All those major items down to these nitty gritty little things like a mirror for the car, a holder for the pacifier, a wipe warmer, all sorts of things.
And you know what?
I did really learn that I was buying out of fear.
Psychologists are not the only people who are interested in attitudes, advertisers are as well.
In fact, many psychology majors go into the field of advertising.
Because they learn about what motivates people, what influences people or limits to sensation and perception, as well as how to measure satisfactions.
All of these things, motivation, influence, and sensation, and perception are involved in advertising.
In the campaign to bring Charles Taylor to justice, for example, we saw how activists used a meeting between US President Bush and Nigerian President Obasanjo to get Taylor put on trial for war crimes
Fifth is to give solutions
Its not enough to bring attention to the problem
We have to articulate concrete solutions, actions that people with power can take to prevent and end human rights abuses
These have to be practical and realistic
Theyre often small steps along the way to an end goal that is more bold and ambitious
And sixth is many points of leverage
We often dont know what will create the tipping point
Advocacy is an art, not a science
as contributing to the common good, that I have observed from my contact with the Hizmet Movement is the fact that theyre trying, in a world that is very divided, and very intolerant, to be accepting and tolerant of all people, regardless of their race, religion, where they reside
When thinking about which advertisers are most innovative in talking to moms, I often talk about advertisers like Quaker out of Chicago, in understanding that a mass reach outdoor campaign can complement an online campaign, which can complement an influencer sampling program, and complement the insights that are driving the engagement of moms.
And I think the work that Quakers done in the last year has been fantastic.
I also think that Walmart has really done a tremendous job.
Not only reaching out to the mommy blogosphere and understanding whats in the hearts and minds of moms, but really trying to use insights to form their media, to shape their creative, and to engage across the spectrum, looking at online as a piece of the integrated campaign.
JEFF KING: Media fragmentation and multiple touch points is a huge topic.
I think that our industry and advertisers, to some degree, has over-complicated that whole thing.
The way we try to look at integration is to try to make it as simple as possible.
If you think about the ways to reach consumer, there are two ways.
One is through paid media, and that can be through a variety of channels.
And the other is through earned media, which we traditionally think of as public relations, but which now also includes social media, is probably the biggest example.
So when we look at integration, we look at, how do we integrate ideas that cross both platforms?
Ok we are working on developing our characteristics of our character for humorous.
Weve already established what we are going to do with the voices now we need to take a look at body.
Now when were picking the characteristics of the body were not necessarily talking about maybe they slump over that would be very difficult to transition back and forth to.
that wall, whether we should jump the wall
Take the regulations promulgated by our executive branch, the edicts of government
The Code of Federal Regulations is 170,000 pages of dense text
The regulations of our 50 states are another million pages
These are rules relevant to every person
These are the OSHA safety regulations that every business owner and factory worker must obey
These are the hazmat transport and storage regulations, the product safety regulations for hearing aids and baby strollers and propane tanks and elevators
Are these edicts of government available to citizens to inform themselves
Are they available for publishers that wish to make them more readable
Are they available for businesses that must obey them
Are they available to students that wish to learn
My five and a half years at Columbia College was a great learning experience.
It prepared me for many life circumstances that I have endured and has given me focus in my personal endeavors.
I enjoyed being on a campus that was within city limits.
It gave me a chance to see the city and experience what it had to offer.
My time on campus was also a chance to get more involved with my own personal relationship with nature.
Commuting gave me time to explore the parks in Chicago and view the lake.
When I had time between class, I would often walk around the city toward the lakefront.
This was a relaxing and often rewarding adventure.
When school was becoming a bit much, I would walk to the lake or around Grant Park and take time to unwind.
Now that I have since graduated, I appreciate these times more.
Walking around Millenium or Grant Park gave me breaks between class to analyze and become more peaceful with what was happening in my life.
When you graduate, things change and your focus shifts toward finding work and paying back student loans.
Columbia was a great school, I wish I had more of a connection with the actual campus itself.
My time there I met great independent thinkers and made friendships that still last to this day.
Good Morning!
Id like to take a moment out of your work day to discuss the upcoming election.
As amusing as arguments over who built the forty seven percent are, There is a basic truth to the Democrats and the Republicans that deserves more attention.
Mitt Romney and Barack Obama feel different but, if elected, they will make the same choices.
Obama and Romney will put pretty much the same people in charge of not changing our dangerous and bloated financial sector.
On the war on drugs both candidates support our long failed policy of prohibition.
I would like to speak to you today about the most important thing they have in common, however.
Both the Democrats and the Republicans believe that we the American people are pack of cowards.
They think that they can do anything they want, as long as they promise to make the bad men go away.
Eleven years ago, on September eleventh, a pack of malicious losers killed themselves in the worst way possible.
We reacted.
We conquered two countries and initiated military operations all over the world the continue to this day.
We also changed a lot domestically.
We made a decision to temporarily give up some rights in order to fight these wars.
Eleven years later both the Republicans and the Democrats want to keep the Patriot Act.
They want to keep on fighting these private little wars all over the world.
Both parties are equally likely to start bombing Iran.
They want the right to assassinate american citizens on the say so of the same guys who swore there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
They want more of your money and more of your rights to keep on pursuing all of these temporary policies eleven years later.
These issues wont be discussed in a meaningful way in the debates.
They wont be discussed because they believe we are scared enough to permanently give up the rights that make us Americans.
Thats what people see when they think about reducing a tariff
Theyre worried about losing those jobs in the American industry
However, we want to see the issue in a deeper way, in a more fundamental way
And a key question to ask is, Why do people send us goods
Why would workers in China, in Vietnam, work long hours to send us shoes
 Its certainly not from the kindness of their heart
Ultimately, they want goods in return, goods or services
They are working, they are producing in order to consume
They are sending us goods because they want goods in return
They are not doing it out of the goodness of their heart, but out of self-interest as Adam Smith said
and literally give them the resources so that they can empower themselves learning the things that they need to learn

Do you have to separate kids by perceived ability level
Or do you have to even separate them by age
Can you get back to a world where older kids can mentor younger kids and younger kids can get that mentorship, older kids feel that sense of responsibility
We really are a one room schoolhouse
&gt;&gt; So I believe India can definitely become a superpower as long as it learns to embrace its start-up culture of young entrepreneurs, and as long as its an open environment that fosters creativity and that we work together as a united population.
SCOTT DUPONT: Hi.
Scott duPont here, award winning film producer and welcome back to Film Producing 101 on Expert Village.
Now the next segment were going to do here is Who are the best film investors. And theres no real easy answer for that.
And I dont want to sugarcoat something and say Oh yeah this is the easy way. or This is the best person for film investor. But I will share something here.
Its not necessarily just the richest people on your block or the wealthiest people you can imagine.
Number one, the wealthiest people sometimes are very, very conservative with their money and they dont like to do slightly risky ventures like film investment.
Obviously you dont want to to go a mobile home park or trailer village, people dont have a lot of money there.
and there is a limit on the resolution due to its large size
The speed is about 12 millimeters per second, which is pretty low to achieve fast movements, and the noise is loud
Also it is non-backdrivable, so that the buttons are not pushable
Due to this problems, we switched to the Piezo actuators from servo motors
Piezo actuators are great because they are fast, quiet, and have low power consumption
Especially, their quick movement allows for them to change shape rapidly
The disadvantage is that we need to make our own control circuits and support structure
With this actuator selection, now we would like to introduce how we built the hardware
To give you the overview of the four essential elements, because of the constraints given by the size of actuators, we were able to use at maximum 40 Piezo actuators
The device has touch sensing and communicate with the smartphone through Bluetooth
We use open loop control, which allows quick implementation without the use of sensors
You can see the device that we have prototype
department go for the environmental review well but it turns out that the uh
contract that out to a private contractors uh
who olga is that project rosen uh
and has opened up our students eyes and job fairs that have opened doors to fantastic career opportunities for our students
You know, it was about 18 months ago when this room was also the location for the announcement of my presidency and so this room will always have special meaning to me
It happened on the other side of the room
The KU Foundation has also used this room to host the Ladies Tea, a much-loved event that brings together hundreds of graduates from the forties, fifties, sixties, and seventies back to campus to reconnect with each other
are not protecting your future, you are ruining it
So stay focused, stay to the point and try to get a positive outcome
Therefore it is important for you to control your emotions and not let your emotions control you
Another thing that you need to make a note of is stop assuming
Well someone says something and the next moment you start rolling your eyes with anger
well stop jumping to any conclusions
relax, let not your brain go numb and think negatively
Try to understand and give the other person a benefit of doubt
Yes, probably the other person said something incorrect
The companys president, Richard Fifer, a native Panamanian, scoffs at the complaints
RICHARD FIFER, Petaquilla Minerals: You see it yourself
Every day up there that you do, there are hundreds of people swimming in the river
Thats the best testament to how true that is, eh
MELLISSA FUNG: Around Coclesito, it looks like one major construction zone, new roads, improved bridges
Its all part of another major project thats going up around Richard Fifers gold mine
hello everybody in the twenty-first century our nations are connected like never before In our global economy, our prosperity is shared.
Thats why, as president, Ive committed the United States to a new era of engagement with the world, including economic partnerships that create jobs and opportunity for all our citizens Its part of our larger effort to renew American leadership And I thank Secretary Clinton and all of you, for making economic statecraft a pillar of American diplomacy.
Because just as we have to harness our economic strengths to advance American leadership in the world, we need to harness our foreign policy to advance our prosperity here at home.
With your help, were making progress towards the goal I set two years ago- doubling U.S.
exports over five years so that more people around the world are buying products stamped with those three proud words Made in america. Were moving ahead with the trade pacts from South Korea to Colombia to Panama; increasing trade with emerging economies, from Brazil to Turkey, from South Africa and were standing up to ensure that everybody plays by the same rules, so that our companies can compete on a level playing field.
Today Im proud to say that our exports have surged, to record levels - supporting nearly ten million American jobs Thats the progress weve made; the momentum we have to sustain.
Now, lets talk about speaking extemporaneously.
This is actually, probably, the way that most of your speeches will be delivered, especially in a speech class.
You will be taught and expected, primarily, to do extemporaneous speaking.

a lot of people, they write a beautiful speech, and theyre just not sure how to communicate it
Its hard - you dont know what to do
There are so many unfamiliar and unfriendly looking faces in the crowd
So how do you give a speech that is confident, funny, debonair and charming? Well it all comes down to execution our first tip in execution - lose those notes! If im looking down at my paper all the time, its really hard to form a connection
Youre just not going to register as much because it doesnt seem real
So lose those notes, buy instead of having a whole script that you have to get through - having a few key points that you illustrate with stories
Stories are easy to retell without needing notes because you already know them
So limit yourself to using stories, and your speech is going to be much more effectively communicated, and youre going to feel a lot more confident giving it
Second point when youre delivering a speech is eye contact
You want to make sure that youre looking all around at the various guests in the room
You want to make a personal connection with each and every one of them
Try varying your gaze every few seconds to different parts of the room and that will make a huge difference in peoples ability just to interact with you and feel like theyre being personally spoken to during your speech
It can get a little intimidating looking into the eyes of complete strangers, especially because people tend to have their tv face on when theyre watching a speech theyre just deers in the headlight kind of thing
So one tip we can give you is to look at the friendly faces - focus on a few key people in the audience who are smiling, who ARE engaged, and just keep alternating between them when youre looking during your speech
Tip number 3 - youve lost your notes, youre making eye contact, thats great
Now you have to make sure youre watching the clock
Stories are fantastic but they can also be long winded and drawn out
A 45 second speech is no good because people wont think its heartfelt, but a 45 minute speech is going to have your audience in tears - and not the good kind! So make sure youre practicing your speech in advance
Pull out your iphone, your smartphone, and time yourself ahead of the wedding so that you know exactly how long it is
A good speech length is anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes
Of course if youve got an amazing story, and amazing connection with the groom or bride it can go a little longer
But generally, the shorter, the more people are going to appreciate it, and the better theyre going to be engaged
Once youve timed your speech and you know how long its going to be you go a long way in keeping peoples attention
And finally our last point in giving a strong, confident speech, is to be conversational
You dont need to have every little word scripted out
If youre telling stories and youre talking - just try to stay natural
Keep your body language active, dont stand rigid at the stage, and just relax
Pretend its a conversation between two people not a conversation with 500 other people
A speech shouldnt really be a speech - it should be more of a conversation
Each member of the audience should feel like theyre being personally spoken to
If you do that - you keep it conversational, you use stories, you make eye contact, you lose those notes, youre going to give an incredible wedding speech
So feel confident and enjoy this opportunity to tell the bride and the groom how much they mean to you
Youre going to do great! If you still arent sure how to write your wedding speech, head back to our previous video: the 5 keys to writing a great wedding toast
Goals Speaker: Dr. Erma Jean Sims, Sonoma State University There are four main goals of this session on mandatory child abuse reporting.
The first goal is to help teachers develop knowledge about what child abuse is and to familiarize teachers with mandatory child abuse reporting requirements.
The second goal is to help teachers gain an awareness and understanding of the laws that pertain to mandatory child abuse reporting and how to prevent legal liability.
The third goal is to help teachers recognize incidents of child abuse in their own classrooms.
The fourth one is to help teachers identify appropriate ways to respond to both known and suspected incidents of child abuse and neglect.
We will accomplish these goals by reviewing the law that pertains to mandatory child abuse reporting.
We will discuss scenarios in which you will have an opportunity to make real world application of the law to these scenarios.
These child abuse scenarios were designed to heighten your consciousness to similar incidents of child abuse you may encounter in your own classroom.
At the end of this session on mandatory child abuse reporting you should be able to do four things.
increase your skills to help you lead your teams with more excellence
As I mentioned, if youre tuning in you have a overly talkative person in your group
So lets unpack why this is in the first place and look at some tips for dealing with it
The first thing to realize is that in most cases the overly talkative people dont realize that theyre causing a little bit of a imbalance or a problem
In fact, it probably started early on in the group where you tried to get a discussion going as the leader
Nobody else talked and so they felt like they wanted to jump in to break the ice, kind of the way we want people to be the first one at the buffet
Once someone goes at the buffet, everybody can go to the buffet
So they feel like by jumping in, theyre helping break the ice and warm things up
Then it starts to sometimes set into a pattern where nobody talks so they always want to talk
Nobody talks so they always want to talk
Cause they feel obligated and responsible
One of the big tactics is the Sunday supplement, the circular.
Which is-- I mean it’s been around since 1962. It is completely un-innovative and yet, you know, people seem to use it.
Hey everybody this Graphic Designer Roberto Blake with another Graphic Design quick tip for you todays quick tip is about investing in your personal branding!
Your brand is what people say about you when youre not in the room.
If you think about brand like Apple it can be summed up in a few words... innovative, clean, cutting-edge savvy, well-designed, whatever you want.
Whatever you think of when you think about Apple is what represents its Brand and the story that its telling.
If you think about its advertising and marketing its all frame in that way the same thing for other companies like Adobe and Sony.
Theyve also come up with different taglines to be able to you associate the values that they want to communicate for their brand with an audience.
As a designer you need to do the same thing.
So I talked about creating your own visual style and thats definitely part in developing a brand but there are other things you need to do.
You come up with a possible tagline for yourself and what you doing.
I have a couple them as you know: One of them is CREATE AWESOME another one is ALWAYS BE CREATING and one of my favorite ones is:  MAKING THE IMPOSSIBLE or  MAKING IT HAPPEN.
There are a lot of ones that I throw in different scenarios based on the context Thats another one that I do use by the way: Creativity, Consistency and Context thats something Im known for saying.
You need to find out what makes sense for you in terms the story you want to tell and how you presented and you need to find your own voice and communicate the values that you bring to the table.
You have recently invested in a corporation on Wall Street and you have also heard the term dividend and it says explain to you rather loosely that it is another way of making money in investing off of a corporation.

The people of this Commonwealth and I are disgusted by the total inability of the Kentucky General Assembly to reach a budget agreement.
Instead, lawmakers decided to put their egos and their personal priorities above the needs of Kentuckys families – families that are struggling to pay their bills and hold on to their jobs in the worst recession of our lifetime.
Now ... they passed a legislative budget to fund their own salaries, but they refused to fulfill their greatest duty – passing the people’s budget that funds our classrooms, our teachers, our health care programs, our job creation efforts and our efforts to keep prisoners safely locked away.
good afternoon welcome to the fortnightly update Im trying to keep things pretty brief today as everyone is very busy Id like to start by welcoming Josipa Mijic into the team she joins us from WEF and will work now as a RM a long side Peter and Katie so welcome along Josipa and good luck to Emma in her new role at WEF February it was busy for February we think will be a little bit quieter a little bit easier to get through some work but compared to February last year if you felt busy it was because you were particularly if you were in Doc Prep and it was up by 21% in terms of volume on February last year here which is huge Fulfilment also had an uplift of about seven percent year-on-year compared to the month on month and hopefully that makes it and settlement obviously got the down stream effect and was very busy imitate them out very easy to the really good story of settlements though is that the ratio of purchases to sales of was in favour of purchases about 56 to 44 which has been a good sign to the bank and thats been two months running now apart from that we ran our first help SME session today which was a great success 50 special call out and thanks to and Sandeep Sandu our SMEs who represented the business really well and then got that program working with SME off on a very good note apart from that on a personal note I look forward to seeing all people up in Concord I will be flying up on the Tuesday and hopefully say gday when I am up there

This is financial adviser Patrick Munro talking about what is the definition of a home equity loan.
Of course our home is our biggest asset.

Grewal’s boyfriend, Karan Singh Dhillon, has spoken out following the death of his girlfriend
The couple just celebrated their 2-year anniversary together
They have known each other for 10 years, but didn’t start a romantic relationship until 2015
“She would do anything for people
She would give someone the clothes off her back
She would give someone food and go hungry,” Dhillon&nbsp
told the New York Daily News
“She made me a better person
Reese Witherspoon has still got it
She was nominated, and won, for Walk the Line back in 2006 - the culmination of her meteoric rise which began with her breakout role in Legally Blonde
But little did Witherspoon know that she was peaking, as she found herself starring in a string of box office flops for the next few years
In fact, she STILL hasn’t been able to climb out of her box office slump
So again, like Cotillard, at least she can still hang onto her artistic reputation with this nomination
But one thing that is different this time around - and from Cotillard - is that this nomination also helps give Witherspoon some credibility as a producer
Wild actually has TWO Oscar nominations - also Laura Dern for Best Supporting Actress - plus what’s more Witherspoon produced Gone Girl for which Pike is nominated
Hey, its Tracy, and were going to talk briefly about active listening.
And being an active listener means being a great listener, and how you can be an active listener is first of all, pay attention.
And sometimes, this is where the noise gets in the way.
Youre tired, youre hungry, youre bored; its hard to listen, but you really need to be an active listener.
Um hey I know youve been suffering from depression uh I just wanted to help.

Dont hurt yourself.
not entitled to overwrite my immunity
The case was argued for quite a few days and a couple of weeks after it was argued we trotted off to the Chamber of the House of Lords, when the grand old tradition has changed now, we got a Supreme Court, five Law Lords stood up in turn to give the judgment
It was the single most decisive and defining moment of my professional life in which the system of international rules, the old system, was cast away
Never before had any former head of State been held in the courts of this country or any other country outside his own to be not entitled to claim immunity for a mass crime

Environmental justice.
First of all I think we have to talk about protecting the environment and understanding that I perceive myself to be environmentalist.
I think anybody whos involved in politics, an elected office understands that we have a responsibility to take care of the environment because it affects next generation and the generation after that.
But by saying that we need to find a balance however, in terms of how we go about protecting the environment and talking about the environment.
One of the most important things that were talking about now is energy and how do we get the energy we need in order to run the world and make sure the third worlds come in to where we are now, like in the United States.
In this series Im going to be explaining some of the subtleties regarding zones and timing in Magic the Gathering.

Hi, Im Soojin Kwon, director of admissions at the Ross School of Business.
Ever since weve started offering the team exercises as an optional part of our admissions process, weve been receiving a ton of questions about it from interested applicants.
I want to take a minute to answer some of the most frequently asked questions, and help shed some light on the team exercise option.
[QUESTION: I heard you guys have a group interview process what exactly is that?] Well, first of all its not exactly an interview.
Rather, its a team-based activity designed to give us additional insight into your interpersonal and communication skills.
If we invite you to interview after reviewing your application, you will also be invited to participate in the team exercise - which will be held on campus in all three admission rounds.
We will also have several international locations for the team exercised in round two.
Locations and dates for those will be based on where our apps are coming from - so stay tuned for more information on that.
[QUESTION: I read on the application that the team exercise is optional.
Is it really optional?
Like, if I dont participate will you hold it against me?]  We get this one a lot, so let me tell you: the team exercise is 100% Optional.
Not participating wont hurt you in the admissions process but youll be missing an opportunity to add another positive impression of you to our evaluation.
Youll also get to meet potential future classmates, and current students or alumni.
And, it gives you an additional data point on our fit it with you as a business school.
Which if you remember my previous video about how to evaluate business schools, youll remember it is a really important part of this process.
[QUESTION: Hey Soojin, how exactly does this team exercise thing work?
Im unclear about what to expect.]  Its a thirty minute exercise, split into two parts, and we wont be asking any questions.
The first portion will be introductions and an icebreaker within your group of four to six people.
You will be given a pair of random words to weave into a 60 second story that youll share within your group.
In the next part, youll work with your group to connect your word pairs into a business challenge and solution that you will present to the observer.
Hi everyone!
Kristina here.
I just wanted to give you guys a really quick update on whats been going on and why you havent been on such a regular schedule.
At least not the usual regular schedule.
The main reason is I have a lot of family stuff come up recently and its stuff that kind of takes me away from home.
So Im not, I dont have as much time to make videos for you guys.
So thats the main reason and everythings going to be okay.
Its nothing tragic or anything like that.
Just, you know you have to put family first for a little while.
So thats what Im doing.
The second reason why you guys havent seen me posting card videos as often is Im in LA right now.
Ive been training with YouTube.
Ive been at that YouTube Space LA and its fantastic.
Ive met some amazing YouTubers, people who are just like me.
Who love creating videos.
Ive been a big YouTube fan for a long long time.
&gt;&gt;MARK: Hi Im Mark Perry creator of BuiltLean.com if youre watching for the first time if youre not watching for the first-time you may have realized its been over a year since I put up a video on YouTube.
So first, I want to apologize, second I wanna let you know that Im super excited to put up a lot more videos in the coming weeks and months,and third, what I love is your participation.
Hello my name is Fj Cava and I have an MBA from San Francisco State University in entrepreneurship.
Today’s guest post is brought to us by Ramon Ray, editor of smallbiztechnology.com In order to operate your business successfully there are several components that need to work and work well.
Product The product you have is important - critical.
Is the product the right product that people want?
Is it priced right?
One way to test the market for your product is to build a web site (low cost) and see if you can even get one buy for the product.
Bill Gross of Idea Labs did this when he started Cars.com The Team The team you have in place for the overall execution of your company is one of the most essential components to ensuring you have the right people in place.
Online Content Marketing your product is essential and there are so many great ways you can market your product at very low cost.
Email marketing by some, is being touted as old or out-of-fashion.
Trust me, your FIRST action should be to create an email newsletter that you can send on a regular basis to your customers and prospective customers.
A great web site There are many services that let you create your own web site or you can hire a professional to create one for you.
Online Marketing Often times, word-of-mouth is not enough, and you need to find new customers.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Im Norm Herr, a professor of science and computer education here at Cal State - Northridge working with the department of secondary education and training people in the masters program and the credential program in the use of technology as well as science education.
One of the things that I started doing recently is actually recording all of my lessons.
SECRETARY KERRY: The private sector is today demonstrating an extraordinary commitment to transforming global energy use.
And it is because of your leadership that I am so confident about the future.
SHRUTI JOSHI: I think marketers should first and foremost listen to consumers within consumer conversations.
Its really important for Verizon to listen to our consumers, and make sure that were meeting the needs that theyre expressing.
&gt;&gt; I do see picky eaters but I see everything from a typically developing kid with picky eating to kids that have significant developmental or medical issues who have not learned how to eat because of their developmental and medical issues.
So the initial visit, when parents come in, they can expect just to be asked a lot of questions and their kid gets to play.
If the kid is old enough to participate and answer questions, if they want, they can but its just talking.
The second session, I ask the parents to bring in food and we actually start feeding the kid then and I observe how it usually goes now and then based on what I observe, I start to intervene and start the treatment to see what works so I can send the parents home with a plan after just the second session.
I establish a relationship with the parents by listening very carefully to whats stressing them because when a kid isnt eating, it is extremely stressful to families.
So figuring out exactly whats stressing them out, it tells me how quickly I can go so Im not asking the family to do too much.
I establish relationships with kids with videos, bubbles, I will sing, no one likes it to come to that but I will sing, anything to make the kid happy.
Hay my name is Amanda and I just wanted to make a quick video about payday loans online and the experience Ive had personally with them and I know that some people call them same day loans or online cash loans which they are all pretty much the same thing.
And Ive personally had 5 payday loans now for all sorts of different things.
But the website Ive used for the last 3 payday loans that Ive gotten has been absolutely the best, and so I went ahead and put a link in the description box for you if you want to check it out.
These guys have been so absolutely easy to deal with.
I just applied online, filled the form on there web page out and the money was in my account the that afternoon.
It was very very easy they were easy to deal with.
A couple of weeks into paying the loan back I decided I wanted to up my payments so I could pay off my loan faster and it was no problem, the customer service was fast and easy there was no stress which is some thing that I really liked about the company.
This is financial adviser, Patrick Munro, talking about what is the difference between CD and a money market account.
A CD is a certificate of deposit with a bank or financial institution.
As such the money is tied up for a definable period of time.
It can be one month, three months, six months, a year or more.
During that time you do not have access to your money or there will be a penalty.
Accentures ability to help its pharmaceutical clients achieve more efficient global regulatory submissions that will enable them to get medicines to market more quickly, safely and at a lower cost has been enhanced.
They have entered into an agreement to acquire Octagon Research Solutions, Inc., a provider of clinical and regulatory information management solutions and software for the pharmaceutical industry.
This is a quick summary and analysis of Coraline by Neil Gaiman.
This is a story about a girl named Coraline who lives in the countryside with her mother and father.
She is an adventurous girl who likes to explore.
She lives in a large house that is divided into two other units.
One is occupied by two retired theatre stars and the other is occupied by an old man who trains mice.
As she explores her house, she finds a door with a brick wall behind it.
However, when she tries to open the door a second time, she finds that it leads to a mysterious world that is similar to her own.
In this Other world, she meets her Other Mother and Other Father, two figures that are similar to her real parents, but they have button eyes.
They treat her well and they want her to stay, but she insists that she go back to her own world in fear of having buttons sewn in her eyes.
After her parents disappear in the real world, Coraline goes back to the Other World to find her parents.
There, she discovers that her Other Mother has tricked other children into leaving the real world.
Coraline challenges her Other Mother to find the three souls of the children and her parents.
As per agreement, if Coraline finds the souls first, she and the rest of them get to return to the real world.
If her Other Mother finds them first, Coraline will stay in the Other World.
Coraline finds all three souls in marbles throughout the house and find her parents in a snow globe.
With the help of a cat, she escapes through the door and back into the real world.
Despite escaping, Coraline must deal with her Other Mother’s hand, which is crawling around and trying to steal a key that is around Coraline’s neck.
In the end, after trapping her Other Mother’s hand in a well, Coraline begins to fix her relationship with her parents.
As always a lot can be said about this story, but what draws my interest and attention is the idea of dual worlds, as if everything in this world is mirrored in another world.
More importantly, this book explores how roles and relationships change in those dual worlds.
So, lets talk about science and beauty at the same time.
&gt;&gt; Theres often been a dichotomy set up or proposed that really pits morals against researchers in saying that in proposing that human embryonic stem cell creation is tantamount to murder as it involves the destruction of the blastocyst.
I have issue with that interpretation.
My interest in the  LSE program really focused on my interest in sustainability.
As an undergraduate student at Portland State I got really involved in the Take Back the Tap campaign, which is involved in installing water bottle refilling stations and I knew that as I was looking for a graduate program that something like the LSE program would be a great place where I could continue to make change but also learn about how to kind of empower other people in making change, specifically in kind of educational contexts.
In yoga, the practice of meditation is called Dhyana.
The gig economy is freelancers and people working for themselves
It gives us the opportunity to do some of the things that we really want to do instead of working a full time job
People go from project to project or day job to day job rather than having a job
This new frame of working where people provide services that they could do pretty easily to other people looking for them in a marketplace or technology enabled format
I would pick flexibility over a stable job with benefits because I like the idea that I can work when I need to and work really hard if I need more money and Im my own boss
For me my work was never just a way to make a living



I wanted it to be an expression of a passion
It took me a long time to find stability with benefits within the life coach industry
Having a flexible job and doing something that Im really good at is more important than being in a nine-to-five
The gig economy can empower the worker because you have more flexibility over creating a career
I think that there are a lot of benefits out there that a lot of people dont know about
You know, like Small Business Administration within each state
If you believe in a lot of the things that unions supported, we dont have that kind of dynamic in the economy
I think were going to start seeing benefits packages pop up for the gig economy because so many people are missing out now on the tax front, on the healthcare front, on the retirement front
I think its good for the society
I think it gives people, especially people who arent traditionally trained and low income, are able to kind of start up and do their own thing and seeing that others are doing that is helpful
So entrpreneurship kind of goes hand in hand
This idea of having trends and services on demand has allowed us to operate more freely and almost have this concierge type service
Its a trend thats not going to be reversed

Good day, Im Dr. Charles Grimes, and Im speaking today on behalf of Expert Village about finding a theatrical monologue for use in auditions.
A very practical consideration for you as an actor is cutting your monologues down to size.
You have to take the monologue as you find it in the text and make sure it fits into a one or a two or very rarely, a three minute slot.
The last thing that we want to take a look at when were talking about evaluating a speech and speaker with regards to presentation is overall poise and confidence.
How does the speaker present themselves?
Are they very tentative and unsure and hiding behind the podium and personifying lack of self-esteem, lack of confidence?
Sometimes they even say, This isnt going to be any good.
Im not any good at this.
Hi, my name is Pat Goodwin with Pat Goodwin Associates dot com, and today were going to talk about how do you respond to an employment rejection letter.

Hi, this is Michael Niren, Immigration Lawyer and Founder of VisaPlace.com.
Today, I want to talk to you once again, about the new Immigrant Investor Venture Capital Pilot Program.
Thats a mouthful.
I looked into it in more detail.
We have more information about it.
I can say, unfortunately, I dont think its a serious program.
Why I say that is because I believe 99% of prospective applicants who were interested wont qualify.
First of all, you need an enormous $10 million net worth to qualify.
If it’s someone you only just met and you don’t have an ongoing relationship with has done something that’s offended you or impacted you in some way, then simply saying “Look, I’m really angry with you” may be more appropriate than saying, “I feel really hurt that you cut in front of me in the traffic or whatever
” Now, if you’re expressing these underlying emotions and you’re still feeling that there’s massive amounts of anger and you’re feeling really enraged or out of control, then you need to do something physical
So exercise is a fantastic way of burning off anger
Any kind of exercise will do it for you

These creatures are brought here by Columbus, and then the people who followed him
When you think about the cow itself, this is probably the key domesticated animal in human history
The cow eats nothing but grass, which we have no use for, and then what does the cow turn grass into
Beef and milk and cream and butter and leather and on and on and on

Think about the pig brought over by Columbus

Hey everyone.
My name is Allen, co-founder of askromeo.com and on behalf of Expert Village Im here to show you how to meet a woman at a supermarket.
How to have confidence.
Theres a couple of things you want to keep in mind when you are being confident or confidently approaching somebody else.
The first and most important is your body language.
You want to make sure that you have an open stance or an open posture.
Accenture completed the deployment of the General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) in July, helping the Army achieve audit-ability while streamlining business processes at 227 Army bases and offices in 71 countries, including the United States, Kuwait, Germany and South Korea.
The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has hired KPMG to conduct HIPAA compliance audits this year.
Over the course of 2012, KPMG will be conducting audits on 150 companies.
If I look at our work, obviously, you need skills, fundamental skills, to understand if its a go to market kind of work, then you need to understand how markets work.
But the core of the work that we do is about problem solving.
And having an engineering background or going through an engineering degree has its pros and cons.
On one hand, they do allow you to think about how to break down a problem and look at different competence and come to kind of a design solution.On the other hand, they can potentially straight jacket you in problem solving which means in some sense they force you to move very quickly into a solution without really exploring a lot of different options or develop divergent thinking.I am a very firm believer that before you converge into a solution, you really need to explore different solutions.
Keep on pushing the boundary of thinking.
An engineering mindset is always to get to closure, get to the solution and then move on to execution.
And doing that very quickly can be a challenge because you probably do not explore all the solution options.
And sometimes you may end up missing out on a truly innovative solution if you do that, if you close out a problem very quickly.
But, as I said, it does give you a good handle in how do you solve problems, how do you think about a problem?
Secondly, in a lot of the work, having mathematical skills and thinking is very critical.
So, sometimes if you do not have that and youre coming from a background has not kind of built those skills, you might have a problem because a lot of our cases might require modeling.
They might require a kind of complex mathematical kind of analysis.
And if youre not comfortable with numbers and spreadsheets then you can have a big problem.
Often engineers or others who have gone through courses which build those skills find it an advantage.

We’ll pick it up from here in the next video in this series
In the next video, we’ll go over three more common interview questions: ‘How did you hear about this position’, ‘what attracted you to our company

’ I hope this video on job interviews has been helpful
There’s nothing better than walking out of an interview feeling that you were fully prepared
My name is Louise and Im at the Linus Pauling Mock Congress at LBCC this year and my bill is about mental health and mental illnesses in children and teens.
And my bill is to help get support and care for children suffering from mental illnesses.
Because 50% of girls and 40% of guys have some form of mental disease.
And the bill is to get health care facilities, hospitals, clinics to provide free or reduced priced treatment for children even if they walk in without a guardian or parent.
MS. JENSEN: Our next question comes from Korka Bah: During the AU summit in Addis, Ethiopian prime minister called for urgent action to avoid the further escalating of violence between Christians and Muslims in Central African Republic.
What actions does the U.S.
take to help Africa end this conflict that has led to a humanitarian crisis? ASSISTANT SECRETARY THOMAS-GREENFIELD: We are deeply concerned about the situation in CAR.
As you may have heard, I visited CAR with Ambassador Samantha Power back in December, and we were horrified by what we saw there in terms of the intensity of the hatred and the killings that are taking place.
We met with government officials, we met with religious leaders, and we met with ordinary people to talk about how we might better address this issue.
We have committed to supporting the peacekeeping efforts that are taking place right now in the CAR.
We particularly thank the French Government for their efforts and the troops that they have put on the ground.
Hi, its good that you can join me in my study
This week, in addition to working on the doctrine of the atonement, Ive been preparing for my upcoming debate with Eric Wielenberg on the foundations of morality
Wielenberg, you may remember, is a non-theist who believes in the objectivity of moral values and duties and who grounds them in a sort of moral Platonism
In response to my criticisms of his view, Wielenberg adopts a very interesting strategy
Philosophers call this strategy tu quoque, which is Latin for the same to you
 On the playground it would be, sos your old man! In other words, you dont answer the objection, you just throw it back in the face of your opponent and say, the same to you
Youve got the same problem as me
Your view is just as bad as my view
 Now the risk of this kind of a strategy is that it doesnt really answer the problem with your view
It just says that the other guys view is as bad as yours and if your opponent can show that his view is not really analogous to your view, then youre stuck with this unresolved problem
Moreover, this kind of a same to you response on Wielenbergs part is apt to provide aid and comfort to the other opponents of which, against which, hes arguing; namely, his fellow atheists who deny the objectivity of moral values and duties
Wielenberg is engaged in a two-front war
On the one hand hes battling against theists who affirm the objectivity of moral values and duties, but ground them in God
On the other hand hes battling against his fellow atheists who deny that there are any objective moral values and duties
And by adopting this tu quoque strategy against the theist he seems tacitly to admit that both his view and theism are encumbered with these unresolved problems, and thats going to make his fellow secularists who deny the objectivity of moral values and duties feel very good indeed
In the March 19th election, we will not be selecting a new government
The government of Canada will be fixed
It is there already, and it’s not going to change
The differences in the numbers of the parties mean that there will be no dramatic shift in power
Now the Liberals and the NDP will tell you that it is critical that they get another member
But the question really here is we’re only electing one member
We’re only sending one person to Parliament
So the question really is what is the best voice that we can send to Parliament that will most contribute to the dialogue
The opposition parties still have to work together to get anything past Parliament
And they even have to pull some of the Conservatives
So we need a voice that can bring people together, that can galvanize people, that can even attract some of the Conservatives in order to get anything past the Harper government until we have a general election again in 2015
Is that voice going to be another Liberal or another NDP person who will be sitting silently in the backbenches and given an order paper every day? Or is it going to be somebody who brings forward a clear vision and is given the voice to speak as loud and strong as possible for this community
So that this community has a voice in Parliament
I’m Elizabeth May’s Climate Change Critic
I’ve worked with her for three years on Shadow Cabinet and several years before that
I’m a trusted confidante and I belong to a party that wants a bigger voice in Parliament that demands a bigger voice in Parliament And, it’s a party that respects the fact that individual members should have a voice and should always vote their conscience
This is financial adviser Patrick Munro talking about variable annuity drawbacks.
Like the word implies, variable means up and down.
Most people would like their financial future to go up, maybe stay the same for a while in stormy times, but never go down.
Satan has fooled many Christians into thinking they don’t have to be separate to follow Jesus.
They think that they can be part with the world and with sin and with people who live in sin.
They don’t think that they have to come out and be separate to follow Jesus, BUT SATAN knows that if he gets you to fellowship with sinners, to take part in what they are doing then you won’t really have your eyes on Jesus, you won’t really follow Jesus with your heart, but you will just pay Jesus lip-service, but He will NOT have your heart.
So many Christians are paying the LORD lip-service but they have NOT separated themselves from this world.
They haven’t cut themselves of from sin or from the people who are living in sin.
If you are not willing to be severed from the world for the namesake of Jesus, then you’re not ready to be a disciple of Jesus.
of democratic systems of government which havent had any of those side benefits
In Afghanistan for example, we havent had just one election or two elections, weve gone through three elections, presidential and parliamentary and what do we find
Do we find a flourishing civil society, a vigorous rule of law and good security

In the marketing puzzle you’re gonna have to include a large on line piece into that puzzle.
Essentially you’re gonna have to include it as part of an integrated strategy.
Hi this is Diana Barchenger and I came to Dr. Polzin to help me take care of the pains that I had in my feet.
They would really get warm at night, when I had covers on my feet; I had sharp, shooting pains going through my feet and they are getting better to stand on, because before they would really hurt and every step in every area of my foot would hurt.
I encourage everybody to come in and give him a try, thanks.
MR TONER: The DPRK court has convicted U.S.
citizen Otto Warmbier.
Mr. Warmbier was reportedly charged with, quote, “hostile acts against the DPRK,” end quote, and sentenced to 15 years’ hard labor.
The Department believes that the sentence is unduly harsh for the actions Mr. Warmbier allegedly took.
Despite official claims that U.S.
citizens arrested in the DPRK are not used for political purposes, it’s increasingly clear from its very public treatment of these cases that the DPRK does exactly that.
It only underscores the risks associated with travel to North Korea.
These days, Europe needs a boost.
We need to inject energy into the economy, generate tomorrows jobs, and make public money work harder.
The cloud is a great way to do all of those things.
Giving everyone a locker to store their favourite pictures, music and films – and access them wherever they are.
Offering cheaper, more flexible IT to boost businesses bottom line.
And enabling public services that are more integrated and effective, while saving taxpayers money.
All together, the benefits from more and better use of cloud computing could be worth several hundred euros a year for every European.
But only if we get the policy framework right.
Already today, many people use a number of cloud services without even realising it – from webmail to Facebook.
And many companies are investing in cloud technologies.
But many are held back – because they want their questions answered before theyll get cloud-active. Questions like, can I easily transfer my data from one provider to another?
What happens if the provider goes bust?
Or, how can I be sure my contract is safe and fair – even if I dont have a law degree?
This uncertainty makes it harder to trust the cloud, and harder to unlock its benefits.
Hello! I’m Kurt Browning, Pasco County Superintendent of Schools with an update on Hurricane Irma
We all know that hurricane paths can change from one update to the next
Based on what we know now, and after consultation with Pasco County emergency operations leaders, we will need to open shelters in schools beginning Friday morning
That means we will have to close all schools on Friday
Although you may question why we are closing all schools, there are good reasons
First, the EOC doesn’t want school buses full of school children on the roads as evacuees from other parts of the state are arriving here
We expect thousands of south and east coast Floridians to seek shelter here, or to pass through on their way further north
We also use school buses to help evacuate special needs citizens to shelters
Our food and nutrition services staff work in the shelters providing meals to evacuees
Likewise, our maintenance and other employees staff the shelters
Principals whose schools are used as shelters have to prepare for evacuees and staff the shelter as long as people are still there
We also want to allow our employees time to prepare their homes and property for the impact of the storm
The governor has closed all state offices on Friday, as well
All sports and extracurricular activities are canceled for Friday and over the weekend
There’s a good chance that schools will be closed on Monday, but no decision has been made in that regard
We will contact everyone on Sunday by phone and email, and will post information on the district and school websites and on district social media sites
We also will notify media as decisions are made
Please continue to make preparations
Secure your homes, stock up on flashlight batteries, water and non-perishable foods


So, today I was supposed to film an episode of Ask an Autistic, and it was going pretty well
I was battling executive dysfunction, which kind of explains what bad thing happened
But it was going okay and I did my makeup and I was like, alright, lets do this, I got my notes
And then I was like three minutes in and the battery died
And now its charging, but I wont be able to film an episode today, so I wanted to make use of my makeup and my words that I have and make a little vlog
I dont know how to vlog
Ive never done this before
Um, Im in my kitchen
You can see all my carbonated water over there
I drink a lot of carbonated water

And you can see my cat calendar over there

Its all black cats
One for every month of the year

Something Ive wanted to address in the a/Autistic community is the throwing under the bus of intellectually and cognitively disabled people
Now, I know what youre thinking
Amythest, no ones intending to hurt anybody elses feelings
 And Im like, I know
But lateral violence in the disability community happens
And so heres what I see happening a lot
There is autistic people, and they are talking about Autism and their neurotype, and they go to defend themselves by saying things like, Well, autistic people arent stupid
Or, they even use the r word
Or, Autistic people are actually really smart
 And in defense of non-speaking autistic people, its like, Well you know, just because they look outwardly unintelligent doesnt mean thats true
They could have a really high IQ
Which, by the way, IQ is totally not a thing
Its super racist and ableist in its origins, and its just terrible, and not even that accurate
And super biased, towards white men
So, if you want to read about that, you know, video description

Theyre like, Oh, they have a high IQ, they are actually really intelligent, so thats why they deserve respect
But the thing is that intelligence [scoffs] is this super racist, ableist, sexist concept
And yet, its like, how a/Autistic people defend ourselves
And in the process we hurt our intellectually disabled and cognitively disabled disabled cousins
And the thing is, there are a/Autistic people with intellectual disabilities as well

And there is this valuing of traditional abled ideals of intelligence that is hurting the community
When it all comes down to it, human beings deserve respect, and autonomy, and inclusion, and accommodation because they are human beings
