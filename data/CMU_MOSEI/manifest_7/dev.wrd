I see that there are three category of writers.
This is Rhett Reiger, White Caspian Studios on behalf of Expert Village.
I want to talk for a brief minute about location scouting.
Now in a big shoot there is a location scout or many of them that actually go out, get all of the clearances done and make sure that these locations all appeal to the director for the type of movie that he or she is going to create.
Fear is a great enemy of entrepreneurship.
In the United States we dont punish failure to the degree to which failure is punished in Europe.
In Silicon Valley, its almost a badge of honor if you have started something and it failed.
Now, lets talk about another area of classroom management that you will most likely have to deal with every semester.
That is students who are not reading the textbook.
This is a really big issue.
I want to talk about textbooks a little bit, in length, during this section, but the first thing I want to tell you is you have to find a way to test the students on the textbook, because the majority of them will not read it.



It’s only getting better from now

I think the change that were seeing in marketing in general, is again, it used to be thinking, I think marketing as a cost.
I think now youre seeing it move to a true sort of opportunity to say now, of course its a cost but its also profit center.
When I started the store, I have made a huge investment to stock products.
Business was good initially but companies has a tend to launch new products every month.

Now, heres where Ill get push back, and I hear this all of the time
But I dont want to shove it down my kids throat and then they will reject it


Based on my experience, heres what Ive seen
Hi, this is my review of this movie, Six Days and Seven Nights
Which is a nineties Harrison Ford, semi-action, more romantic comedy flick
Despite how serious he look here on the cover theres not a lot of action going on
Its him and Anne Heche
Shes the love interest
(umm) pretty funny but all in all, not not worth the price of admission
This is the DVD widescreen edition so you can actually enjoy the full aspect
It was actually some good scenery in this
Some good stuff to watch
But (umm) Harrison Ford plays his (stutter) normal character, a gruff cargo pilot
Mine as well be Han Solo in the Caribbean
(uhh) His character hates tourist, so of course he has to spend a week with Anne Heche, a tourist, and they have some romantic involvement
They get stranded together on a deserted isle
Its kind of (uhh) Castaway like, except Castaway is really good
(uhh) I give this a two
I cant really honestly give it anything better than that
I recently got to see the movie TMNT
(stutter) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (uhh) movie
(umm) not necessarily by choice
We happened to go to the drive in and it happened to be the second movie on and we happened to have some little friends with us that were little boys so needless to say we stayed and watched the movie
(umm) The little boys liked it, the little girls fell asleep
I couldnt wait til it was over, but you know if you have little boys then, you know, they probably would like this movie
(umm) It might be one to wait though, and not go to the movie (uhh) theater and see, but I would wait for it to come out on video and then maybe rent the video
I dont think it would be worth taking the whole family to the movies to see it
(umm) I dont know, it was just kind of boring
Maybe its just because I dont have little boys so Im not really into the little (uhh) characters like that
Hello, everybody
This is Helsing920 (stutter), and Ive got a DVD review for everybody
And even though it is only, right now, at least, it is only, you know, July, Im talking about holidays today, specifically, three of my all-time favorite holiday specials on one disc
Im talking about Garfield Holiday Celebrations
This one disc contains not only Garfield, not only Garfields Halloween, Halloween (stutter) Adventure, a special Ive Ive (stutter) watched almost every year since I was about four, but it also has Garfields (stutter) Thanksgiving, which is a pretty funny little short, funny little special, and A Garfields Christmas, which is just absolutely awesome
Honestly, if you are a fan of Garfield in any way, youre going to absolutely adore this thing
Its probably three of the best (stutter) holiday specials made in the last (uhh) lets see
Lets see (stutter) now, the Halloween special, a little, Im going to go about twenty-five years
And thats being really generous, because I know that the I know that the (stutter) Halloween Adventure was made after I was born, and I was born in eighty two
But still
Regardless (umm) all three specials are just awesome
And this and this (stutter) disc, unfortunately, you really arent going to find it in stores until around October, when everyone starts stocking up on Halloween DVDs
In fact, thats when I got this thing
Or I should say, that, that, that (stutter) is when my family picked up this thing
And I sat down and I I (stutter) watched the whole thing at once
And then, Thanksgiving, I watched it all again
And then Christmas, I watched it all again
I watched this thing three times in three months
Thats saying quite a bit, guys
So, yeah, Garfields Halloween, or Holiday Celebrations
This thing, if you guys dont have it, youre going to need it for your holiday DVD list
Im giving this beast a four out of, (stutter) I mean, (uhh) wait, four, no

This sucker here gets full honors, guys
Five out of five
Hi my name is Jordan and I would like to review Pirates of the Caribbean three, at worlds end
(umm) Frankly, I Ive (stutter) seen the first two so I knew the kind of you know wonderings that the characters you say undertake but after seeing the third I was horribly disappointed
(umm) It it (stutter) was so confusing about what was happening
Half the movie was not fighting was you know backstabbing and underhand dealings and you never know who was on whos team and what was going on
Really not I think in order to see this movie, you would have to watch the first two right beforehand to understand it properly because, coming out of that theater after two and a half hours, I still had on idea what was going on
(umm) I dont know what the movie directors were thinking I guess they decided that by throwing as much fancy computer graphics as they could they would cover up the fact that there was absolutely no plot
(umm) Really, (uhh) unless youre a die hard fan, I would not recommend this one
Youre really not missing out on anything
(umm) And in fact, you know a lot of the character development was kinda (uhh) was a little bit angering such as (umm) you know Keira Knightleys development
I am not going to give away the plot if you do want to see it but (umm) but I was very disappointed
Okay
FREDERICK CROSBY: Its become a real big focus in the last year.
Everyone used to be concerned about their store, their store, their store.
This is Patrick Munro, talking about what is a personal secured loan.
In the world of finance loans can be granted to borrowers, but as always, there is security required for the loan.
It secures the fact that the creditor is going to be repaid for the service that theyre giving.
This is a review of the movie Ratatouille
(uhh) Its a movie about a rat who lives in the French countryside but (umm) he dreams of becoming a famous chef
(uhh) So he ends up making his way to Paris and once hes there he meets a human boy (uhh) who gets a job at a French restaurant
(umm) The rat is able to control the boy so that (umm) the boys making the dishes that the rat wants him to make
As a result, the boy becomes famous for making such delicious food when really the rat is the one who is responsible for (uhh) making the dishes
(umm) This movie was excellent
(uhh) I would recommend it to anyone
I think that (uhh) it would appeal to all age groups
(umm) In fact I think that the movie was perhaps geared toward a more mature audience
(umm) A lot of the humor felt more mature than than (stutter) in previous Pixar movies
(umm) But I still think that kids would enjoy it equally as well
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix yes Harry Potters back and I think hes forty seven in this one no no hes not that old but (stutter) hes starting to look old in the movies theyre all starting to look all grown up, and (umm) Ill admit it that Im Im (stutter) a dork and I enjoy the Harry Potter movies not saying everybody that enjoys Harry Potter movie is necessarily a dork, but (umm) Im an older gentleman and I enjoy the kid movies but (umm) its a very good movie (stutter) I mean the the the (stutter) movies in general are very good they the first one was really good the second one was still pretty good, and they just went on downhill from down there, this one wasnt very good I mean I didnt think it was that good (umm) Harrys back in school yet again and I think this is his fifth year, and (umm) this time new people are taking over Hogwart the school, see I told you Im a dork I know the names of the school, and (umm) theyre trying to discredit Harry saying that Lord the the (stutter) bad guys coming back I dont know his name Valdemort, Valdemont (stutter) I know it begins with a V I know that much but theyre trying to discredit him and (umm) to me it just seems I dont know maybe im growing up whenever the first one came out I was a little younger than I am now but (umm) I didnt enjoy this one and Im sure kids will enjoy it, I I (stutter) mean there was a lot of magic and the acting in it was really good, and (umm) the scenes were really good the (umm) the magic scenes looked awesome, but (umm) I just didnt enjoy it
Hi today Im gonna review this DVD Ten Items or Less
This is a short documentary film that stars Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega
(umm) It was really very strange movie (umm) I guess its from the documentary style
It deals with (uhh) the Latino community and this underprivileged girl who works at a grocery store and Morgan Freeman is this older, out of work movie star who sort of takes up to her and (umm) tries to help her and build her self esteem
The character {cough} the characters (umm) you really learn to enjoy their (umm) their bond that they build between each other
But as far as the movie (umm) it was just not a (umm) very exciting movie, I couldnt really figure out the plot to the story
I mean it had a plot but it was sort of like whats the point
(umm) They did a good job with the acting but the storyline just didnt hold up as far as I was concerned it was just too much just normal everyday life
(umm) {cough} This particular one is rated R and its only eighty-two minutes long
Its English with (uhh) Spanish subtitles, and (umm) I probably wouldnt really recommend it I mean if you have it its fun to watch but I probably wouldnt recommend buying it
Id probably give it two and a half stars and (umm) thats about it for this one
Ill be reviewing the DVD version of Fantastic Four
(uhh) I was really disappointed with this movie you know
I wasnt Im not a huge fan of Fantastic Four
My limited experience with comics to begin with but this just, was just kind of a an (uhh) movie, you know
Its just kind of the big, super slick you know, action blockbuster thats you know, a lot of lot of (stutter) you know, colors, a lot of style but not really much substance behind it
(uhh) You know Michael Chiklis does a pretty good job but hes really the only (uhh) you know decent actor
You know, the people the people (stutter) who get this you know, Jessica Albas a good actress too but (uhh) he just you know, gives a pretty decent performance or worthwhile performance you know, a bunch
(uhh) You know, if you dont know what its about (uhh) you know its a team of scientists that go up into space to explore this kind of radiation field thats going by earth and you know it ends up you know destroying their station and when they get back they all develop super powers you know
Four of em become the Fantastic Four and you know the fifth one (uhh) becomes you know the evil (uhh) the evil (uhh) the evil villain you know that they have to fight and save the world against
(umm) You know like I said, its its (stutter) an alright movie
Its its (stutter) a popcorn flick you know definitely
Its not even, unfortunately its not even that great of a popcorn flick but you know, if you like this kind of movie you know, you probably wanna pick it up
(uhh) Special features is not so bad (uhh) you know
Its got a commentary from some of the actors and the director
(uhh) Its got a video diary from the filming, behind the scenes (uhh) you know some deleted scenes, a making of documentary
Its your usual bunch
I mean its not that bad as far as that goes
But (uhh) you know it might be worth checking out, (uhh) you know if you like this kind of thing
Hi, Im here to review this movie (umm) Jeepers Creepers two on DVD
This is the (uhh) special edition DVD
(umm) This is the (uhh) second movie
(umm) There was Jeepers Creepers one, and (umm) I mean I didnt like this movie
(umm) Im not a really big fan of horror movies
It was about this (umm) high school team
They (umm) they get stranded on a (uhh) their bus breaks down and then (umm) theyre trying to survive this (umm) this maniacal killer whos like killing them off one by one and (umm) you know hes hes (stutter) selecting who he wants to kill and everything and theyre trying to stick together
Theyre just trying to survive (umm) I mean like anyone would do
Theyre definitely just trying to survive
(umm) Its very gory
(umm) So all the killings are really gruesome and (umm) it was really gross
(umm) Didnt really like this movie, just because of all the blood and all of the (uhh) all the gross, like, sick killing scenes
I mean if youre into that kind of stuff then I mean I would suggest it
Okay
This is Donnie Darko
Its (umm) definitely a cult movie favorite
(uhh) Its, out of five stars, I would give it a five
(umm) It follows this boy Donnie Darko, played by (uhh) Jake Gyllenhaal
And Hes hes a very weird kid
(umm) He sees this this (stutter) like demented bunny who tells him when the world is going to end and Donnie just has to figure everything out
(umm) Its definitely dark
(uhh) Not recommended for kids at all
(umm) I really like how its done because, if you watch this movie five times you will still not understand everything about it
(umm) Theres just so much things
It it (stutter) involves like, (uhh) theoretical physics and just so much stuff and Donnie Darko no matter how weird he is is still really funny
Hi, Im Bruce and today Im reviewing The Host which is now out on DVD
This is actually a Japanese film, its a monster movie
It was (uhh) very well (uhh) reviewed on the (uhh) the movie poster (umm) and so I was (uhh) taken in to (uhh) check it out and see if it was a good as the reviewers said
Unfortunately it was not
(umm) What youre watching right now is the scene where (uhh) this monster, this (uhh) sea creature is first found
(umm) Where its about to drop in the water and (uhh) mayhem begins
(uhh) But basically its the story of a dysfunctional Japanese family that (uhh) ends up coming together in order to save (uhh) the young girl that is (uhh) taken (uhh) by this (uhh) sea monster
(uhh) I definitely would not recommend it
(uhh) We actually had to skip through some of the movie because it just got so drawn out
(uhh) But (uhh) if you enjoy seeing foreign films (umm) you might (uhh) have a little fun with it
(uhh) We (uhh) enjoyed seeing the (uhh) the subtitles (uhh) versus the, the (stutter) dubbed voices, dubbed American voices (uhh) and how the dialogue (uhh) differed from the subtitles on the screen
(umm) and so you might enjoy that
(uhh) But all in all its its (stutter) not a very good movie and so I would not recommend it
(uhh) But (uhh) like I said it might be (uhh) good for a laugh (umm) if you really like monster movies or if you (uhh) like Japanese films
So anyway thats my review of The Host, now out on DVD
(uhh) Available at your local video store or Redbox
Scott Reed talking: I think right now where we are . . . the hardest thing that we face is, having kind of established what the game is, . . . uh, we know we don’t have to keep reinventing the wheel every year and that’s fantastic.
But now I think our . . . our hardest work is . . . legitimacy.
Making sure that we don’t just build the engaging game but that we’re articulate about our reasoning and our purpose for wanting to do it.
Um . . . especially having discovered in the last year that many people in the community are going to have a negative . . . sometimes I’d say even knee-jerk reaction to the idea of playing games and trading cards and having sparkleponies in the context of a professional conference.
Hi, Im here to review the movie When Worlds Collide
(umm) There are really no known actors are in this movie
(umm) Its directed by George Pal who did many other (uhh) science fiction movies during the fifties
In it, an astronomer discovers a planet and its moon are in a direct collision course (uhh) with the earth
He goes to the world governments who think hes a crackpot and really have no interest in building a rocket ship to try to (uhh) save a few people kind of like a Noahs arc to another planet
So he goes to private invest investors (stutter) and a few millionaires (uhh) decide yes (uhh) the human population is worth saving
So they give all their money to him
Hes able to save forty people (uhh) on his rocket ship, which I found pretty interesting since he has thousands working for him to build his rocket ship and most of them know that hey, the only chance is for forty people getting out so why am I wasting all this time and energy to helping forty people get away when the astronomer, his daughter and her two boyfriends are already guaranteed four of the forty spots on the rocket ship
(umm) The special effects arent all that good
Hello expo
Im here to review Alien Versus Predator: Requiem
(uhh) I went to this movie and I was greatly disappointed but maybe I shouldnt have been at this point cause I shouldnt have expected much from it
(uhh) The movie was a classic Alien Versus Predator
(uhh) Its pretty much the story of (uhh) a ship crashing, a predator ship crashing, from the (uhh) last one
Crashes on earth in a small town and aliens get loose and start killing all the inhabitants
(uhh) So a Predator has to come and save and hunt these aliens
(uhh) So I mean if thats what youre after, if youre all after is is (stutter) a Predator killing aliens then fine
The bad part is theres only one Predator, which kind of sucks
So you didnt get to see a bunch of different cool things like in the others
(umm) Definitely gets tireless after a while {laugh}
Dont expect much in in (stutter) acting or anything like that, its pretty much just classic Alien Versus Predators
(umm) I would recommend waiting for a movie
(uhh) I dont think you should go see this in theater or even pay matinee for this
Just wait for a movie to come out and enjoy it then
Hello, today Im reviewing The Exorcism of Emily Rose (uhh) starring Laura Linney
(uhh) This movie is supposed to be based on a true story
(umm) The previews for it looked really really really good, (umm) but it was not quite what I expected
(umm) I expected something more along the lines of an The (stutter) Exorcist (umm) where it actually shows the story of the girl and the priest coming in and and performing the exorcism and going through it step by step like that and that just doesnt happen in this movie
(umm) This is actually told (uhh) from the point of view of a priest who (umm) performed the exorcism on Emily Rose
And it starts at his trial
Hes on trial for (umm) completing that exorcism and the only time you get to see Emily Rose is actually through flashbacks or through his storytelling
(umm) The parts where you actually get to see her and what shes going through (umm) with demons possessing her are great
(umm) If the whole movie wouldve been like that this definitely wouldve been, you know, one of my top movies of all-time because the part where its focusing on her is well acted
The girl in this movie did a really really good job
You do feel like shes being tormented (umm) but there just was not enough of it to support the movie
(umm) There are some haunting special features on this one (umm) some commentary, some deleted scenes (umm) and some other featurettes
(umm) If I had to rate this one I would say probably leave it alone
Its gonna get a one out of five from me
(umm) Just not enough of the actual exorcism (umm) to make it worth viewing
Hi, Im Valerie and today Im going to be reviewing the movie Fred Claus
(umm) Its currently out in theaters and its about this guy named Fred and he is Santa Clauss brother
And its around the holiday times when everyones getting ready for Christmas and theyre getting all their toys set and (umm) so they have their little family get togethers and (umm) Fred doesnt really get along with anybody really
He thinks the whole situation is silly
So he kind of (uhh) steps in one day and looks after things at the North Pole and then it turns into this big party and everything goes kind of crazy havocy and so, Santa Clauss brother doesnt really like that too much and so I dont know
Its (uhh) its kind of a kid movie
I personally didnt really like it
I would rate it a two out of five
(umm) It seemed like he was just trying too hard I guess
But if youre a really young kid you may find it entertaining and nice
But (umm) not my type of Christmas movie
So, thats Fred Claus
(uhh) Go check it out, if you want
Hi Expo, this is Nikki
This is my review on the movie National Lampoons Christmas Vacation Two
(uhh) definitely not as good as the first
(umm) I think they were reaching for this one
(umm), I think since they had (umm) such a good one the first time
(umm), I think they thought that they could probably put another one together and (umm) my personal opinion, I think they failed miserably, but, you know, again,thats my opinion
(umm) I wouldnt recommend this to anybody, really
(umm) I was just greatly disappointed
Randy Quaid xxx yeah, {laugh} theres some funny things that he does, but he did those things in the first one
(umm) its (uhh) not rated
Eighty-three minutes long
(umm), it should be rated junk
(umm), so if (uhh) you really want to (umm) yeah, dont dont (stutter) waste your time, its its (stutter) really terrible
Hello and welcome to my review of the movie Twenty-Seven Dresses
(uhh) This movie (uhh) starring Katherine Heigl (uhh) most of you probably know her from (uhh) either Greys Anatomy (uhh) the ABC tv show
Or (uhh) (uhh) you may also know her from the movie Knocked Up
(uhh) Knocked Up was a hilarious movie that I really enjoyed and (uhh) was expecting something along that lines for this movie
(uhh) Its about (uhh) a girl whos kind of proverbially always a bridesmaid never the bride, (uhh) hence the name of the movie Twenty-Seven Dresses
(uhh) Shes been in twenty-seven different weddings and has twenty-seven hideous bridesmaid dresses to prove it
(umm) Its just kind of one of those predictable movies that (uhh) I dont think I would recommend going to see
(uhh) I I (stutter) was pretty disappointed with with (stutter) it overall
(uhh) Its just you know, I had a few laughs and that sort of thing but nothing you know just, compared to Knocked Up which was just absolutely fall on the floor laughs I didnt think it was nearly as good
(uhh) You know Katherine Heigl does (uhh) a a (stutter) good job and she is kind of settling into a comedic role, (uhh) so she does a good job acting its no, not (stutter) a problem with the acting its more a problem with the story
So overall I would not recommend seeing this movie I would give it two out of five stars
Hi
Today I wanted to do a review on the movie, The Heartbreak Kid
(umm) Yeah
Let me just show you a little clip first


894} Alright
That clip right there was (uhh) {cough} (uhh) this guy you know hes (umm) had some girlfriends but hes kind of afraid of commitment and (umm) he, for some reason, he is kinda good friends with some of his previous and he was at a wedding of one of his girlfriends, previous girlfriends, wedding
(umm) Theres the movie as you can see
Case
But, (umm) what I wanted to say about this movie is that I am going to give it a one out of five stars just because if you have any morals what so ever, you wont watch this movie just because one, its very crude (umm) so much unnecessary stuff goes on, (umm) seems like theres always sexting or something inappropriate so I dont recommend it for kids and two, it promotes like saying like its okay to (umm) divorce and just you know garbage like that (umm) which you know theres so much divorce already and in, you know, United States, why do we need a movie saying its okay so basically what happens he meets this girl and they get married and they go on their honey moon and then he starts hanging out with another girl but Im not going to ruin it but, yeah
Hello Expo TV
Today I have for you a review of a movie currently in theaters the Bee Movie
(uhh) In my opinion the Bee Movie is exactly that, a B movie
B here standing for bad
(umm) In some ways I look at this movie as (umm) an attempt, I dont know by either (stutter) the actors in the movie or the company who produced it to get back on its feet or something it didnt really
It was supposed to be a comedy, an animation and perhaps a kids movie and it was that
It was a kids movie
It wasnt very funny
It wasnt very entertaining
(umm) It really didnt (uhh) add anything and give anything know to you know (umm) cinematography (stutter) (umm) Its basically just what the title says, a bad movie, a B movie (umm) and I really do think that
I give it two out of five stars
(umm) Perhaps you know, (stutters) two out of five instead of one out of five because I did laugh sometimes
(umm) It just didnt do it for me though
It was it was all in all a bad movie
I would not recommend it
Hi, Im here to review the movie The House of Yes
Starring Parker Posey, Josh Hamilton, (umm) Tori Spelling, Freddie Prinz Junior
(umm) This was a movie about an eccentric rich family living in Massachussetts who are (umm) obsessed by the Kennedys
(umm) Josh Hamilton plays the son, hes bringing his fiance to meet his family for the first time
(umm) His his (stutter) mother tries to buy her off (uhh) but its his sister Parker Posey who is (umm) completely obscene, {laughs} or not obscene, insane and obsessed (umm) by her brother who probably most frightens us (uhh) in this movie
(uhh) The movie is billed as a dark comedy but (uhh) I didnt really find it all that funny, I found it kind of ridiculous and (uhh) maybe bizarre
If if (stutter) thats a good word
(uhh) I think the best line in the movie comes from Tori Spelling when she looks at Parker Posey and says no youre not insane youre just incredibly spoiled
(uhh) The House of Yes a rounding no
Hey, yall
Its the king of movies here, and today Im going to review ten thousand BC, (uhh) which recently came out in theaters
Its (uhh) from the director of Independence Day and the Day After Tomorrow
And (uhh) while I found those films (uhh), particularly Independence Day, to be pretty good, (umm) (uhh) ten thousand BC fails in that department
(uhh) Its about basically a, a (stutter) tribe of people who, (uhh) you know, like someone who (uhh) one, one (stutter) person gets (uhh) like a princess kind of deal happens where (uhh) she gets kidnapped and basically the tribe goes out to rescue her and then they meet other tribes and a whole kind of war happens
(umm) I thought the ending especially was, (uhh) was pretty horrible
(uhh) I dont want to ruin it, but (uhh) they, lets just say that they tried to surprise the audience all of the sudden with (uhh) a kind of (uhh) (uhh) just just (stutter) new (stutter) introduction of new characters, and I thought that was fairly week and disappointing
(umm) Its, (uhh) its been getting (uhh) pretty negative reviews by the press, but I tried to go into it with an open mind, (uhh) particularly because I liked Independence Day and (uhh) unfortunately it failed
The CGI, (uhh) there was a lot of CGI
Some of its good
Some of its kind of bad
(umm) There, it just wasnt my cup of tea
Wasnt well executed, pretty formulaic, bad ending, wouldnt recommend watching it
Hello, today Im going to review Semi-Pro starring Will Ferrell this is a movie thats basically a vehicle for more crazy Will Ferrell zany antics (uhh) hes playing a basketball player this time and thats basically all the plot there is to it
It really has no plot, just an excuse for Will Ferrell to do crazy dumb things and (uhh) basically I think Will Ferrell might be out of schtick (uhh) all of his movies have been kind of dropping off into being repetitive and dumber and dumber and this one is probably the worst movie hes ever made
This has happened to a lot of the Saturday Night Live alum and (uhh) speaking of Saturday Night Live movies its just to give you an idea, I would say of all the bad movies that have ever come out of their characters this one would probably just barely beat Ladies Man
This is a really bad movie, it has no plot whatsoever and I really had high hopes for it because at his best Will Ferrell can be (uhh) apparently zany and funny, but spent a lot of money advertising (uhh) this movie, had multiple spots during the superbowl
They even put the semi-pro character into the sports illustrated swimsuit edition
You really couldnt get away from it and then you see the movie and really, really disappointing and it kind of think if it spent some money on writing instead of advertising it might have been a little bit better
Hi
Today Im reviewing the movie, The Happening
(umm) The Happening is the latest movie from writer director M
Night Shyamalan, who previously directed the good movies Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs
And the not so good movies The Village and Lady in the Water
(umm) Unfortunately, this one cant even fit into the not so good movies category (umm) Ill get to that in a little bit
(umm) The movie stars Mark Wahlberg as a science teacher and Zooey Deschanel as his wife (umm) and also stars John Leguizamo as his friend
And something happens at the beginning of the movie and, for some reason, people start talking funny and killing themselves
(umm) The cause of this is never fully explained
(umm) There are theories that are thrown about and the big theory is pretty silly
(umm) {clears throat} My problem with this movie isnt so much the plot
(umm) It was probably a good idea when M
Night Shyamalan created it, when he thought of it, (umm) but unfortunately, most of the time, the actors actually find themselves walking or running, rather, away from the wind
They run away from the wind
(umm) If that sounds exciting to you then maybe you can go check this movie out, but otherwise, dont bother
(umm) The problem is also that the dialogue and the acting are atrocious
(uhh) Thats probably the best word I can use to describe this movie is just atrocious
(umm) The Village and Lady in the Water were sub-par movies compared to the three movies that he made originally, but they were at least well made films (uhh) this Im surprised this movie actually got any kind of release, any kind of distribution
The dialogue is horrible
(umm) Dialogues never really been his strong suit, but he usually casts decent enough actors or, at least, gets the best out of the actors that he casts to make up for it
(uhh) With Bruce Willis or Mel Gibson, (umm) Paul Giamatti, (uhh) Bryce Dallas Howard, theyre all decent actors in his movies
(umm) I dont know if it was teaming up with Mark Wahlberg, who has is notori notoriously (stutter) wooden actor I dont know if that hurt the film, or not, but he also did not get anything out of John Leguizamo or Zooey Deschanel, who are usually pretty fine actors themselves
So, I dont know what exactly happened here, but the acting, it feels like the words are being read off of a script
As youre watching the movie it looks like theyre actually looking at cue cards and reading these words for the first time, thats how the delivery is
And it doesnt help that the words theyre delivering are just dumb
(umm) I almost walked out of the movie, but I wanted to stay till the end
I wanted to see how it wrapped up
(umm) The beginning of the film where the construction workers start to kill themselves, its towards the very beginning of the film, (uhh) that was the first real sign of trouble, for me, was the acting by the lead construction worker
And, from there, it just went downhill and it went really over the top when (uhh) they were in some diner and a lady is looking at her iPhone, which is horrible product placement, and watching some ridiculous video about a guy in a tiger pit
Obviously CG
Bad CG
Just terribly done
Terribly delivered dialogue while theyre watching it
Its just an awful movie
Im only gonna give this one one out of five stars
I dont recommend anybody ever seeing this
(uhh) This is the kind of movie thats gonna to be ridiculed in five years on DVD by drunken Frat boys because its just that awful
Hey everybody, this is Tom and today Im going to be reviewing the movie Hancock
As always, bam, movie ticket, right there
Out of the way
Alright, Hancock
It is a Will Smith attempt at making a superhero movie in a summer of really good superhero movies
Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Dark Knight
Okay, as you can tell Im doing this a little bit past the point when Hancock came out, but you see where Im going with this
Hancock is not good
One, no one has ever heard of this, two, I hope nobody will remember this cause this was a bad movie
Okay, it had its funny points because its about a bum on the streets who has superhuman abilities
And eventually he gets himself into trouble where he (stutter) he ends up saving a public relations guy and he tries to build up his image to get people to like him
That is the story of this
(umm) Okay the one thing that drove me nuts was the camera
Yes
Half the time the camera was doing three-sixties
So I think I kinda want to do the rest of this review doing nothing but three-sixties but that would drive you guys nuts, cause it drove me nuts
(uhh) Maybe I was the only one who noticed, who knows
(uhh) It it (stutter) was funny at times, but, you know, (stutter) it wasnt good enough for me
(stutter) No
I I (stutter) didnt enjoy it, I I (stutter) just kind of sat there Hmm
Okay
This was funny
Why am I spending my money watching this? {sigh} I think I was more sad that I spent the money to watch this but (umm) otherwise it is funny enough to watch it, but not funny enough to watch it in theaters
Wait to rent it if youre really desperate, buy it if you want to
(stutter) Dont know, its more up to you
Im going to give this a two out five, hope it helps
Hey all
Its the king of movies here and today Im going to review (uhh) The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
Now (uhh) this is a new movie (uhh) starring (stutter) Brendan Fraser, Jet Li, and Maria Bello and its the third (uhh) movie in the, The Mummy series
I believe the last one was actually in two-thousand-one or two-thousand-three
It was definitely over five years ago so (umm) this is kind of a surprise in a way to see a sequel so soon, perhaps its because (uhh) Indiana Jones four came out and people are kind of on that adventure wave right now
Theyre, (uhh) theyre enjoying their adventure kind of movie
(umm) This movie as as (stutter) the other ones were is is (stutter) not to be taken too seriously, its pretty much popcorn entertainment
(uhh) Its just something that you watch, mindless fun (uhh) that you eventually, you know, just forget about pretty much immediately after watching it
(umm) As as (stutter) popcorn entertainment it doesnt really (uhh) (uhh) fail necessarily, but it doesnt do its job as great as say even the first Mummy
(uhh) The movie has Jet Li in it, which is a nice surprise, but I feel that if they (uhh) could have used him more in it (uhh) it would have been movie if they did
(uhh) Theres some CGI in, CGI in (stutter) here that isnt very good and (uhh) usually there shouldnt be a problem but (uhh) it just detracts from the experience I think
(uhh) (stutter) It ends up being a little (uhh) a little disappointing
(uhh) Theres also just not that much (stutter) stuff in terms of originality
Its a lot like the other Mummies, if youve seen those and you like them youll probably want to just see this cause youll like it too
If youre looking for even like a slight twist in the Mummy formula you probably wont wanna bother watching this because youre not going to be getting something like that
So once again, if you, if you (stutter) enjoy just popcorn movies like even Journey to the Center of the Earth, if you like that (uhh) you might want to check this out
(umm) Unfortunately this one isnt in three D though, so its not as entertaining but (stutter) I think this is strictly for Mummy fans and people that just want (uhh) some kind of escapist movie to forget about their worries for ninety minutes
And thats my review of The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
(uhh) In this movie they actually go to China and thats the whole dragon thing and thats why Jet Li is in it, in case you were wondering
Hey expo Tv
Today I am going to talk about another summer movie that is currently in theaters
Vicky Cristina Barcelona
(umm) xxx seen this with a few of my friends and I was much more soft having done so (umm) this film has little substance
Its a Woody Allen film strangely enough which you would think that it would have some substance but not this one (umm) with some big name actors Javier Bardem (umm) Scarlett Johansson and Penelope Cruz all on this film
And basically what it is, I will give you the basic plot Penelope Cruz, her character and Scarlett Johanssons character (umm) travel to Barcelona (umm) and there you know they are alone and they are young females
Basically there they just have (umm) relations with Javier Bardems character (umm) and hes still involved with with his wife so its kinda like a love quadrangle not a triangle cause theres three of them and one guy so quadrangle (umm) thats about as deep as the plot gets (umm) they try to do some cheesy plot development and cheesy character development
It doesnt really work
Theres a little bit of humor in the film (umm) I think Woody Allen has an interesting sense of humor, a very dry sense of humor
That I think worked with the film (umm) but originality wise, this movie is nothing that hasnt been made before Its just kinda sleezy (umm) waste of time completes your mind type of thing
Hey guys, Tina here and I want to do a review for you today of a movie that I just watched on DVD and the movie is called The Haunting, its The Haunting of Molly Hartley
(uhh) This is a rated R movie on DVD, its just recently released on DVD and there arent any well known (uhh) actors in this movie, a lot of no names
I honestly cant name one character for you that I knew in this movie
Some of the faces looked familiar but (umm) not so much that I would be able to name them for you
Its basically (umm) based on the haunting of a high school student (uhh) whos haunted by her mother
(umm) Apparently her mother tries to (uhh) kill her when shes younger and (umm) it really haunts her in terms of psychologically
She has to see doctors and so forth
I think its more of a a (stutter) teen flick more than anything because it revolves a lot of the, the (stutter) things are based in the high school where (uhh) Molly goes to school at
(umm) I watched it with my eleven year old daughter and she really enjoyed it, she likes scary movies, and it does have some scary points in it
I didnt really care for it, all I could say its more of a a (stutter) teeny bop movie

Hello, this is Linda Katehi, the chancellor at UC Davis, and I would like to speak with you through this video which will become the first of a series of such messages to connect with you.
When I was born into a poor family on a small Greek Island, women were not expected to even go to high school, let alone college.
I was the first woman from they island to get a degree.
As I moved up through the academic ranks, there were often few women among my peers.
This is why I have always worked hard to improve opportunities for women and other under-represented groups.
This is why I have worked tirelessly for everyone to have a chance at a free or affordable education to transform their lives.
When I came to UC Davis in 2009, the university had lost half of its state support for students because of the Great Recession.
Thanks to many tough decisions by our faculty, students and staff, we came out of this crisis financially stronger.
Today, 55 percent of our students pay no tuition, because of our financial aid programs and one billion dollar endowment.
However Mistakes have been made along the way.
The pepper spray incident was one that I will deeply regret for the rest of my life.
It has never been something that I want us to forget.
We learned from it and we now do a better job protecting you and our campus.

Hello, Im Matthew and Im here to give you my review on this DVD movie called The Feeding
It came out in two thousand six and it was directed by Paul Moore
Besides that I cant tell you the rest of the cast, it really has a bunch of nobodies in it
(umm) The storyline is a bunch of college students go camping in the woods and there is a werewolf which is chasing them
This is definitely an independent film
How it got made I dont know
This movie was quite possibly the worst movie Ive ever seen in my life
But almost to a point that was very funny
It was shot on a very low budget
It was shot really kind of grainy
The acting was horrible in it
Almost like they were reading cue cards
The werewolf costume was completely unbelievable
And it also had a person in it who kept shooting the wrong, missing the werewolf when it shot at it and (stutter) shooting the college kids
So she ended up killing about four of them because she was such a bad shot
This movie, how it got made I dont know
How it got released on DVD I dont know, but it was quite comical to watch and on a scale of one to ten I would probably give it a one
Hi, Im (uhh) reviewing the movie called (uhh) the Epic movie, which is currently in theaters and (umm) you know Ive seen commercials on TV and (uhh) its basically a type of movie like Scary Movie, like the series where they make spoofs of everything, and (uhh) Ive seen it on TV and (uhh) it looked (uhh) pretty funny from the (stutter) from the previews that I saw
(umm) I saw that over the weekend, did did (stutter) good in the box office
I think it got something like over twenty million dollars
So (umm) I decided to pay ten dollars, you know, go to the movie theater and see it and (uhh) gotta tell you that Im extremely disappointed in the movie
(umm) For more than half of the movie, I didnt even laugh
(umm) The only time I did laugh was at the the (stutter) pretty dirty stuff which they usually dont put in movies but, I mean that was pretty funny to me
(umm) there are a couple of rap music scenes from from BET, that were trying to make fun of, wasnt really funny
Hey guys, (uhh) Im going to do a quick review on the movie called Epic Movie
Its basically a movie (uhh) comedy satire (uhh) its it (stutter) mocks movies such as the (uhh) Da Vinci Code, Nacho Libre, X-Men, (umm) Land of Narnia, (uhh) Chocolate Factory, and some other movies I cant really think of right now
(uhh) it its (stutter) a movie that you dont really dont need brains to go watch it
Its a lot of toilet humor and cheap laughs, and if you are really really really desperate for that kind of a comedy, I highly recommend this movie for you
(umm) I mean if you are expecting (uhh) a lot more, I mean with this type of movie I dont think you will enjoy it
(uhh) Its, its (stutter) got a pretty, pretty (uhh) low rating (umm) right now, but its doing very well surprisingly, in the box office
So if youre really desperate for (uhh) I mean, cheap laughs and that sort of (uhh) genre movie I would highly recommend (uhh) this movie to you
Hey guys, this PlatfromerFan.
Im here tonight because I just have something to get off my chest.
If you guys ever followed the Machinima Youtube channel than you were probably aware of the show called All Your History Are Belong to Us.
You were probably aware of the controversy involving the new format of the show went through a few weeks back, mainly involving the new host Chris Lockey.
Well recently the show has been cancelled, and I think now its time to get something off my chest.
Its obviously too little, too late, but I just feel the need.
I...personally feel that Chris Lockey was a great host.
Flawed, yes, but he wouldve gotten better if we had given him a chance.
But, we never really did, and instead of leaving good, constructive criticism most of us just decided to leave complaints.
And now, because of that, Machinima got intimidated, and decided to shut down the show entirely: costing us a good quality series and Chris Lockey a job.
But seriously, it go- the hate got out of hand, people.
When Rob Talbert, the previous host, says it got out of hand it got out of hand.
KATHLEEN MCCARTNEY: Im Kathleen McCartney, president of Smith College.
On behalf of our faculty, staff, and students, Im pleased to introduce the psychology of political activism, women changing the world.
Our first MOOC reflects Smith Colleges ambitions and values in six important ways.
The course offers the same rigorous content that students find in traditional Smith classrooms.
It invites dialogue and debate, hallmarks of learning and development.
It is rooted in Smiths extraordinary Sophia Smith collection of womens history, the oldest and one of the largest such collections in the world.
It models our commitment to continuous innovation in teaching and in learning.
It supports the democratization of knowledge, by making course content available to the world.
&gt;&gt;JACK KITAEFF: The time is right to elect a president of the American Psychological Association from outside of traditional governance.
Ive been a member of the APA for 35 years, but have never held elective office and have not been part of APA politics or governing activities.
In essence, I have been like you.
The time is now to tap into this group who is passionate about the future of psychology, but have allowed others, often the same people over and over again, to assume leadership roles.
But, where has this gotten us?
Those times are over.
I am the only candidate for president who is both a lawyer and a psychologist.
During these recent difficult times, a president with knowledge of the law and a strong allegiance to ethical and legal principals affecting our profession is necessary.
I am that person.
The past three presidents of the United States have worked toward achieving mental health parity.
As your president, I would do the same.
I would bridge the gap of omitting priviledges, pay scales and prescription priviledges for qualified psychologists in every state.
Now the last thing I want talk about is everything that weve talked about.
If youre looking for a degree in entrepreneurship, we have an excellent program.
The advantages of an education in entrepreneurship is that it gives you that foundation that broad foundation of education and some practical simulations and experience that will help you to be more successful.
The courses for online are geared for everything specialized for an entrepreneur versus being general and in online it fits also because entrepreneurs can be anywhere in the world.
While taking my degree I have lived most of the time Nigeria, Africa.
I started while in the US.
I barely took three courses before I had to go back home as my job demanded, and so every other course since then has been from Nigeria.
Part of what makes our program different is the faculty that we have teaching it.
Theyre entrepreneurs themselves and so they know about the curriculum, and they know about putting it in action.
I remember takin a course on enterpreneurship and that seemed like the entire reason why I was here.
This is the movie Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid
(umm) I really couldnt watch the whole show, but basically its about (uhh) the blood orchid is a rare flower and it holds the secret to eternal life and they start to (uhh), you know they go into the jungles to find, to hunt for it
And of course they, the (uhh) stories about an (stutter) anaconda and so you they find this giant anaconda that (umm) was in the movie and I couldnt even stand to look at it
So (uhh) I didnt watch the whole show but if you are afraid of snakes or anything youd probably have your eyes closed the whole movie so I I (stutter) didnt like it
Just looking at this cover with the snake on it I dont like it
Anyways this is (umm) let me see if they have any special features
The special features are deleted scenes, previews, and (uhh), and the making of the feature so
All of the actors are (uhh) lets see Johnny Mess, Messner (stutter) KaDee Strickland, Matthew Marsden, Eugene Bird, Salli Richardson-Whitfield, Nicholas Gonzalaz
Those are are the actors
Hello everybody I want to say thank you to everyone at San Diego State University for co-hosting the summit with our Reach Higher Initiative.
And I want to thank all of you who traveled from across the country to be here today Like all of you I believe that nothing is more important for a young persons future and the future of our country than getting a good education.
And in todays world that means going beyond high school to a community college, a 4-year university or professional training program.
And thats what Reach Higher is all about.

And today were talking about your major assignment, the literature review
Theres a reason we have your literature review due at end of Week 4
And thats because were going to have all of Week 5 for your instructor to pass it back to you, so you can make some revisions to it
Its very rare that the literature review is OKd in the first draft
So please as you submit this, consider it a first draft of something thats going to have a couple iterations

So lets say, again, were talking about methods of parent involvement
And I found some good studies
As I said earlier, just to follow on
It’s a great delight to see so many of you here today from five participating schools
The motion before us today is: This House considers that environmental protection of the Arctic is more important than the need for economic development and job creation
And that is exactly one of the key area of the report that we ourselves will be looking at
The most fulfilling result of the work that scientists and researchers do is coming close to knowing how the natural world works
For scientific samples to be gathered the Arctic must be preserved
Further knowledge of any change can rapidly be known
But economic development, such as mining who are limiting the amount of natural resources and landscapes that the researchers and natural scientists can use
MR KIRBY: A quick note on this airstrike, which I know many of you have covered or have asked about, in Aleppo on a Doctors Without Borders hospital.
And I want to preface this by saying I think you’re going to hear something more specific from the Secretary soon on this.
But I didn’t want to relinquish the podium at the outset without mentioning that we’re obviously – find this attack reprehensible in every possible way.
We’re looking at dozens, if not several dozens, of casualties in this strike on what was clear that was a medical facility.
The details and the circumstances of the attack are still coming in, but it sure bears all the hallmarks of the kinds of strikes that the regime has done in the past on treatment facilities and, frankly, on first responders.
Digital consumers really have changed as we’ve seen the age demographics start to shift and seeing the bloomers becoming older and then the Gen X-ers and Gen Y-ers really getting into the space, especially for health care and pharmaceuticals.
They’re really growing in the space.
So innovation, once again, is key.
But the users itself, you can really target a lot better than previously, but not just on that, but targeting based on what they’re watching and what they’re doing offline and how to bring that into the on line space.
Legion M, the worlds first fan-owned entertainment company, is hoping to break the Hollywood studio mold.
NewsBeat Social sat down with Legion Ms CEO Paul Scanlan and President Jeff Annison.
[Annison] Its the first time in history that regular people like you and I can actually invest in film and television and content projects. [Scanlan] We love Hollywood, we love pop culture, this is why were doing this.
But we also believe if you look at some of the major investments happening... theres not a lot of new franchises being born anymore. [Cambrie] Aside from fan investors, will individual content creators be able to get involved with Legion M?
Today Im going to be sharing with you my favorite Gillette product.
And it is the Venus razors.
This one in particular is the Venus Breeze razors.
And I really like these because its basically a two-in-one on the razor.
So you still have the three blades, but then you have these little-- its like a gel soap bar on each end of the razor.
So you actually dont need to have a shaving cream or lather on your leg.
You can actually just shave straight with this.
I like the Breeze ones a little bit better, because Ive noticed this doesnt tend to-- the jelly soap doesnt tend to melt as fast as some of the other brands.
Or not the other brands, but the other types that Venus has out there.
And it lasts a little bit longer.
- The financial aid process was a long, arduous one for me to learn about.
There are tons of different financial aid; each college does it differently.
Sometimes you might have to learn about how one school does it and how another.
Theres a lot of similarities a lot of times so they can transfer, but you always have to be specific with any college that you look into.
What I learned is that some colleges give you a hundred percent, or a hundred percent of financial aid of tuition and board and that sort of thing.
And our lifetime hashrate chart
Little heads-up for you -- that sometime on February 12th at block 630,720, we will have our annual decrease of inflation
This means that Dashs block reward -- that is the reward to miners, masternodes, and the available treasury -- will decrease by 7
14 percent, to be precise
And as an interesting little fun fact for you, the February superblock -- that is, the February treasury payout -- has supported a new all-time high of proposals: 22
I want to talk to you about Disturbia
This is a new movie (uhh) in which a character is confined to his house, he is under house arrest, and his mother takes away his Xboxes and TV as sort of a little bit of additional punishment
So he starts watching out his window, watching people for entertainment until he sees (uhh) something that basically (uhh) horrifies him
He thinks his neighbor is actually a murderer but there is really nothing that he can do about it because he is under house arrest
(uhh) If this plot sounds very familiar I think I saw this movie (uhh) many years ago
It actually came out about forty years and it was called A Rear Window and it starred Jimmy Stewart, and he was confined to his house because his leg was broken and in general I think that is a much better movie than the movie I have just seen in theaters
(uhh) I kind of felt a little bit cheated because (uhh) the plot is (uhh) very similar
You know, Jimmy Stewart relies on the people around him and his girlfriend to kind of investigate and figure out what was going on
Saw a lot of the same things happen in this movie and (uhh) this movie felt a little bit cheaper
They kind of tried to stylize it a little bit (uhh) for the younger audience but in general (uhh) I really didnt think it was worth the money
Save your seven bucks, go to the video store, rent A Rear Window, youre going to like that movie a lot much better
I would rather buy that movie, (uhh) the Rear Window I mean, than to see this one again
If you do want to see this wait for it to come out on video and rent it, dont buy it
I dont view marketing as the new finance, because I view the relationship between marketing and finances as a different one.
Different in the sense that today, finance has a responsibility to prioritize against multiple contexts, multiple areas within the organization.

Hi, I’m Adam and I’m studying Statistics,  I’m in my first year at Kingston University.
I’m enjoying myself so far and just about to sit my exams,   and I’m first in my family to have gone to University,  which many of you might think is a boundary  between you going to University or not,  I luckily got in!
I applied for Kingston University 2 years ago,  but I took a gap year,  as I felt like I want to travel around and experience new things,  and Kingston allowed me to defer my entry for a year.
I also have an eye condition,  I would’ve thought that it might be a boundary to my education,  although there’s a wide range of support available,  which allows me to access lectures and slides which I can print out and take with me lectures,  as sometimes even with my contact lenses in, I struggle to see what’s actually written,  in the lectures.
Anyway if youve got any questions about anything related  to Statistics, Maths or anything about student life at Kingston,  feel free to ask me and I will try my best to answer.
JOHN AMAN: Experiments in advertising for Nationwide is probably what were doing with Turner and forming a partnership with Turner Interactive on the NASCAR nationwideseries.com site.
So the innovation Im paying most attention to is how an online owner like Turner for nascar.com and Nationwide, a series sponsor, can partner together to drive traffic for each other.
This is a box set of the original three Star Wars movies
A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi
They are referenced countlessly in you know, modern culture, modern cinema
You see references you know Luke I am your father but with somebody elses name
And they are almost an American icon
These are the movies that you know, were in the late seventies or early eighties before the yuppies existed before George Lucas had the money to and the technology to remove everything but the actors
I I (stutter) mean in the original Star Wars, people actually acted it
Its its (stutter) a good set of movies because the story it tells is quite good, (uhh) its got good acting its its (stutter) one of those things that are original, that are icons of America and American cinema, like The Godfather or
It you can name these movies that are historically you know referenced and you know everpresent in our society and Star Wars is one of them and this does it justice
Alright
Pretty, pretty good
Season four Curb Your Enthusiasm
The acclaimed series
Larry David returns for a fourth season
He had five in total, so far
Hopefully he comes back for six
Thats my fingers being crossed
(uhh) Ten episodes this whole, actually eleven because the tenth episode is pretty much two episodes of it together and its like an hour
(uhh) This whole season is about him {clears throat} joining the (uhh) cast of (uhh) The Producers, featuring Mel Brooks
Hes (uhh) in the, hes in a couple episodes
Ben Stiller, and Ben Stillers boy are in some episodes
David Schwimmer and some guy playing David Schwimmers dad is in this too
(umm) After four seasons, actually I have all five seasons, theyre phenomenal
Its good stuff
As you see, it keeps to the same packaging which is amazing (uhh) you know
Let me open this again cause this is, this always amazes me
I like to just sit around, when I can get it to okay, maybe this one doesnt work, but thats not the point
The point is this this (stutter) season is as good as all five seasons
it gets a five out of five stars
Larry Davids a (uhh) curmudgeon and a genius
Hi, this is Rhett Reiger from White Caspian Studios on behalf of Expert Village.
Were talking about casting.
Now the director is very involved, intimately involved with the casting.
Hey ExpoTV, Im Dea, and I generally love sort of these bad teen comedy sort of movies
(uhh) But like I said, generally which implies that I dont always love them
One that I didnt love was Drive Me Crazy (umm) this is a movie with Melissa Joan Hart, where her character, shes trying to (uhh) shes trying to like, get the popular basketball guy or whatever to ask her out
And so and her best friend next door neighbor guy, is trying to win back his exgirlfriend
So they turn to each other
You know, to sort of fake a relationship to make those two jealous, Melissa Joan Hart gives him a makeover, and its all, it all (stutter) feels very like, its not, its not, (stutter) it doesnt have the sort of undercurrent of satire that a lot of high school comedies have, that sort of make them funny
Chris Tucker is known for his off the wall slapstick comedic performances
At the same time, Jackie Chan is known for his martial arts special effects action flicks
Combine the two and you get Rush Hour two, the sequel to the very popular Rush Hour one
(uhh) In this the, (uhh) Chris Tucker plays a policeman that goes to Hong Kong with his, (uhh) to meet up with his friend that he met in the first movie thats played by Jackie Chan, and together they uncover a crime ring, beat the crap out of a whole bunch of people, and generally just do really dumb things
(umm) {clears throat} The acting in this one is not really acting so much as one person fights and beats the crap out of others, (umm) the other star of the movie makes loud-mouth, (uhh) off-color remarks through the entire thing
(umm) Its supposed to be hilariously funny, its unfortunately not
Its quite the opposite
(uhh) There are a few (uhh) good moments in there, (umm) however I really didnt, (uhh) really didnt enjoy the film all that much

Hey again guys
xxx I am reviewing today is the movie Team America World Police, specifically this is the censored and unrated version
(umm) The team who made this is the team (uhh) xxx parker
(uhh) They were the mind behind South Park, a very popular television show
And also (umm) the movie xxx, not so good but (umm) I guess they should really stick to TV because this isnt that good of a movie
(umm) Its all about puppets (umm) sort of the like parody of the old seventies puppet television shows, (umm) but it is not that good it (uhh) it tries to be kind of (uhh) sexy and (uhh) taken into account like political themes like Kim Jong Eun (umm) is the bad guy and (uhh) theres a bunch of like (uhh) celebrities in it who would team up with him because they are like super liberal celebrities
The plots kind of (stutter) but I mean puppets so what do you want
Hey
Today Im going to be reviewing the two disc special edition of The Hulk widescreen
This (uhh) is a pretty ridiculous movie
It covers the story of the Hulk, a man who is (uhh) a scientist exposed to gamma radiation and then ever since that exposure when he becomes angry he turns into the Hulk, a huge green (uhh) monster man with (uhh) unlimited power and invulnerability, and with the added feature that the angrier the Hulk gets the more powerful and more invulnerable he becomes
So basically its a, its a story, this is a story about a man who who (stutter) suffers because he cant control his anger, but also uses this anger to lash out at society and his oppressors
The movie kind of glosses over a lot of the (uhh) (stutter) a lot of the things that you could say with a story like that in favor of just pure action
The Hulk smashing tanks and smashing helicopters and jumping thousands of miles, and while thats entertaining its I also dont think thats enough
I think you could have done a little bit more with this movie, with the subject matter
But portraying him as a tortured soul a little bit better, I dont know
But as it is, its a, its a (stutter) fairly entertaining movie but very, very brainless
(uhh) The special effects are nice, but not enough to warrant any kind of purchase or rental
I kind of wish I didnt have this
I give it a two
Its, its not as bad as, as (stutter) a one but like I said theres very, very little here to reclaim it and make it valuable
Now, something else you want to be aware of is evaluating each particular situation, every time youre in it.

Hi, Im Steve Anthony.
Alright, first lets talk about collecting information.
The bigger the trade show, the bigger the regards.
Also, the more costly.
Hi, Im Peggy Collins, taking a moment to share with you the trade secrets on how to make a trade show successful.
Im a firm believer in top down selling, and the people who either write the checks or tell other people to write the checks attend the big shows.
A good rule of thumb, the expense of the trade show, everything you have invested in it, should return ten times the cost to be a success.
Invest ten thousand dollars and you need to write a hundred thousand dollars in sales from that show.
Do not try to save money on your presentation.
The cost of the space will really depend on the size and scope of your presentation.
I call it that because you can only have one chance to make a strong impression: invest in it.
If you have a really great gadget, show people how it works.
If your product is technologically superior to others on the market, demonstrate it, and make it easy for anyone to see how much better your product or service is.
CHUCK DAVIS: Advertising, when used correctly, is content, and it helps lead people to make good business decisions, find great conversions, and theres great data on all of this.
http://www.joeworthcfo.com Hello, Im Joe Worth with B2B CFO®. Everyone in a company knows about the official organization chart, you know, who does what and so forth.
But did you know that businesses also have an unofficial organization chart?
Its true and identifying what it is can help your company avoid the financial risks associated with growth.
Heres what I mean, every companys unofficial org chart is comprised of just three types of employees; Finders, Minders and Grinders.
Finders are entrepreneurial and are future thinkers who generate new business and build new and leverage relationships that multiply the volumes and revenues of the business.
Minders are the managers in a business they typically live in the past, and rely on historical information to improve future performance.
They make sure work gets done efficiently.
Grinders are the employees that do the actual work of the company.
fundamentally changed the way we’ve always done things
In 1774, America had always been the possession of Great Britain

In 1864, some people had always been able to own other people

In 1918, women could not vote
In 1989, people with disabilities were not considered people
We fundamentally changed those things and we became a better, smarter, stronger nation because of it
So yes, we are asking people to change the way they’ve always done things, the same way we have always fundamentally changed things, when we change them for the better
LIZ CAHILL: This idea of having consumers tell the testimonials, be the stories, we see it a lot with the car industry recently of using behind-the-scenes cameras in test drives.
Theres certain corporate essentials which every company should track above and beyond your minute book.
One of these things is the financial data which everybody knows because the government requires it for taxes to be filed at the end of the year the other thing which many early stage companies forget is the human resources making sure you have good documentation for every one of your team members.
Its a classic mistake for people to bring on a new employee, promise them options and not put them in the minute book and then theres an argument over that, and more importantly, forget to sign employment or contractor agreement which shows that the company owns all of the work done.
My name is Melvin Hunter, Im a senior at NAU School of Forestry with an emphasis in Fire Ecology.
With my degree, I am going to work back home on my reservation which is Walapai as a fuel specialist.
Fuels, prescription writing, and treating the forest really to prevent these catastrophic fires.
And recently, try understand the shifts in vegetation.
Help the landscape either progresses in this shift or somehow mimic a historical regime.
While a student at the NAU School of Forestry I heard about the Hooper Sustainability Award which is a grant for either research study or community sustainability.
Ive always wanted to develop a measurements course back home because working wildlife fire realized a lot of people didnt know paces, they only knew one place on a flat, nothing with moderate to steep.
So I wrote a proposal, I received the grant.
Im Samantha Deutscher for InvestmentPitch.com Investment firm Jennings Capital has updated coverage on SantaCruz Silver, symbol SCZ on the TSX Venture Exchange.
(FSE:1SZ) Following news that the company had intersected a new high-grade silver vein at San Felipe, analyst Kwong-Mun Achong Low reiterated his buy rating and 12 month target of $2.75, a premium of 133% to the $1.18 price the day the report was issued.
The company, which is focused in Mexico, has the producing Rosario project, two advanced-stage projects, the San Filipe and Gavilanes, and an early-stage exploration project, El Gachi.
Drilling on the Transversales vein, at its San Felipe Project in Sonora State, confirmed the continuity of a new vein both along strike and to depth.
Additionally, 3 parallel veins have been identified at surface in the footwall over the currently defined strike length of the main Transversales vein, but have not been drill tested.
These veins average 5 metres in width each.
(map in release) Of the 11 drill holes reported, hole SCVT-02 reported 11.8 metres of 116 grams per tonne silver equivalent.
The weighted average intercept of the reported assays is 2.6 metres of 199 grams per tonne silver equivalent, with 69 grams per tonne silver, 2.7% zinc, 0.17% copper, 0.99% lead, which is slightly lower than the current resource grade at San Felipe.
Drilling has traced the strike at transversales to 200 metres and a depth of 240 metres and it remains open along strike and at depth.
Arturo Préstamo Elizondo, President and CEO stated, The confirmation that the surface outcroppings of the Transversales vein appear well mineralized along strike and to depth indicate a highly mineralized system.
This, together with parallel-mineralized systems and an untested structural corridor of at least one kilometer significantly increases the potential of the San Felipe Project. Jennings Capital stated, We like the broader exploration potential of San Felipe, in particular the Las Lamas vein that only accounts for 5% of the approximately 50 million ounces silver equivalent resource and has averaged silver grades above 140 grams per tonne during this round of drilling. According to management, Rosario continues to ramp up tonnage as additional faces and stopes are opened.
Management expects throughput to achieve 300 tonnes per day by the end of the year as both main veins contribute to production.

Hi, Im Danielle Giacoponello with Bonagora and I have 3 tips for professional buyers  visiting the NY NOW market this week.
First: Plan ahead The NY NOW Market is comprised  of four different sections: Home, Gift, Handmade and New The sections open on staggered dates.
So Handmade opens on Saturday  and closes on Tuesday, but Home, Gift and New  all open on Sunday and close on Wednesday.
Youll want to be sure to visit  the NY NOW website in advance for full show dates and hours.
So, youre getting to shop  the sections you wish to shop on the days that you are actually  attending the show.
The NY NOW website also offers a  comprehensive exhibitors search, so you can map out which vendors  you plan to visit in advance.
A helpful hint is that if you are  looking for a booth number on the fly, you can download the NY NOW  mobile app when you get to the show.
Second: Be sure to stick to your budget.
Dont stray from your shopping list.
If you go to the show looking to add only your most profitable and best-selling categories, it would avoid impulse buying.
The vendors also offer several  different show specials, and trade show discounts.
A lot of people who come to Las Vegas have never had any criminal problems in their life before.
And they come to Las Vegas to have a really good time.
And they get in trouble for the first time.
And for a lot of people, being arrested or being cited and told to come back to court to face a misdemeanor charge is a very upsetting prospect.
So it really depends upon the individual.
A trespassing charge, in the whole grand scheme of things, is not such a big deal.
But some people want to keep their record clean.
They dont want to have to explain a bad night when theyre filling out a job application.
Hello, my name is Penny Smith, and Im a North Carolina real estate broker.
Today I would like to talk to you about how to offer seller financing on your home.
Hamas and other terrorist groups in Gaza are firing rockets on cities throughout the State of Israel on Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa, Beer Sheba, Sderot and other cities in Israel.
No country on earth would remain passive in the face of hundreds of rockets fired on its cities and Israel is no exception.
Today we expanded our operations against Hamas and the other terrorist groups in Gaza.
We will continue to protect our civilians against Hamas attacks on them.
Hamas, by contrast, is deliberately putting Palestinian civilians into harms way.
It embeds its terrorists in hospitals, schools, mosques and apartment buildings throughout the Gaza Strip.
My name is Anthony Maddaloni, and Im going to be talking about how to start a photography business.
Now one thing about starting a photography business is that you want to really, seriously consider what youre doing.
Most people start out in photography as a hobby or something they really enjoy.
Now this is sort of, I dont know, being a little, you know, you really want to look at it.
Do I want to start doing something I really enjoy as a pass time and start it in to a business, because you might not really enjoy doing it so much anymore where it becomes a business.
But, on the other hand, you might actually enjoy doing it more because youre getting paid to do something you enjoy.
I mean, Im trying to kind of make it a little bit comical, but to be really honest with you, it really gets to be that way sometimes for some photographers.
Where as they started out doing something they love and ended up actually hating it and just doing it for money, and in the end, I think sometimes that really shows.
So its really something you want to think about, even before you begin doing anything.
One thing about a photography business is that photography is extremely expensive, so your start up fees are going to be very high.
Being honest, the only reason Im dressed like this today is because I didnt do laundry this week So Im gonna have to be formal for a couple days now So its election season here in America and if you didnt know that then congrats on your first time... ever using a computer?
And... also Living in a country very far from here that is in no way connection to america Cause even without a computer theres no excuse During every major election that has happened in my life thus far, Which, admittedly isnt many,  but its still been enough I have had to hear the same annoying, irrelevant point being driven home Again and again and again By every white liberal and every moderate that I come into contact with Which is, You shouldnt stop being friends with someone just because you have political disagreements. And yeah, I guess Im all down for like, getting along with other human beings despite your disagreements Because youre gonna have to learn to do that to some extent to get by in this world without wanting to murder everyone.
But the idea that there is absolutely no legitimate reason for someone like me to not be friends with someone who is voting for people like Donald Trump or Ted Cruz is really disconnected from the way that the world actually works.
Attacks on political ideas that you believe in arent attacks on you as a person, that is not a claim that is true for the majority of people Its not even true for a lot of privelaged, like, white cis men out there and its especially untrue for women who are facing an unwanted pregnancy or trans people who are just trying to take a shit.

I think that this year is a very important year because the Davos meeting is happening in not a very conventional way because everybody astonishes at crisis but also everybody is trying to think how we can it-this crisis.
And one of the opportunities thats happening right now is the crisis help us to think and which are the fastest ways to go in the direction of a low carbon economy.

You have been invited to a special event that includes an invitation, so lets take a look at how should we respond to it.

You first want to start by deciding whether if youre going to attend or not attend to.
Well, one reason that I write for teenagers is that when I went to high school, I actually went to two different high schools
And at the first high school I was very, very unpopular to the point where I would sit down at the lunch table and people would move way
And after my sophomore year I transferred to a different school, and I didn’t change anything about myself
I just showed up at the new school, and all of a sudden I was really popular, and I had boyfriends and I went to dances and I was on the prom committee and I wrote for the paper
It was a whole different life because nobody knew I was supposed to be a loser
So, I experienced high school, if you think of it as a hierarchy, right, from the top of the hierarchy and from the bottom
And I don’t think that very many people get that chance
So, I think that has really helped me in being able to write characters with, you know, a variety of high school experiences
And high school is a fascinating setting, especially boarding school or summer camp where you really are stuck there
I think when you have a place like high school where you’re legally obligated to show up every day, you cannot walk away
A lot of human drama happens that would not happen in a grownup life where there’s no legal obligation to show up anywhere
And I also think that being a teenager is a very fascinating time of a person’s life
Every single person in their teenage years in America is separating from their family of origin at least a little bit, is navigating money and transportation and changing body and increased independence
That’s true no matter what your economic or social situation is, no matter what your background is, small town, big town, countryside
Your body’s changing, your relationship to your family of origin is changing, and a lot of other things are changing too
This is way more exciting than middle age
Right? This is the meat of becoming a person

There is also this stuff about how’re your not supposed to show you’re religion
But all these policies are mostly targeting Muslim people
Ironically is mostly targets [muslim] women
Islamaphobia in France, it is supposed to protect women from a religion that abuses them
But they are the first victims of these policies
Because since these policies there have been a lot of attacks against women who wear the hijabs by men
Basically in France we have this idea that race doesn’t exist

may vary by species, some studies have shown emotions are perceived as more prominently expressed on the right side of a person’s face
So, as you might guess, animals detecting different human facial expressions isn’t something new… According to research, other animals like dogs and pigeonscan distinguish between faces and expressions
Researchers at the University of Iowa, found that pigeons can see similarities among human faces when it comes to identity and emotion
Essentially, the pigeons could tell when the photographs they were shown were of the same person and when the emotions of different people were similar
And, the research on dogs is particularly robust
In one study, researchers at Azabu University, found dogs could learn to pick out photographs of smiling human faces from those with blank expressions
And researchers from Kyoto University showed that dogs can match their owner’s face to their owner’s voice
The future of display is one thing.

Are you hitting your business goals?
If you are, hooray!
is time to set some new ones.
Maybe ones that are even a little stretch beyond those that you had already set.
Now why do I like to review our goals after 90 days?
Because 90 days is enough time to get some pretty serious kick-ass results and its also not too long so that we can get feedback whether our results are not working.

In her lecture on the geography of rivers, Dr. Laituri showed us examples of two rivers: the Colorado and the Danube.
These rivers are typical of many rivers in that their headwaters are located in mountainous areas—the Rocky Mountains and the Alps in these particular cases.
In such mountainous terrain, snow and snowmelt are important components of the hydrologic regime.
To understand and predict the flow characteristics of these snowmelt dominated rivers, it is important to have a basic understanding of snow and its influence on hydrology.
We did sort of push-pull kind of strategy
When we initially launched the system we decided that we were going to our BIS team and find all of our users that have already been logged on customers to our Internet site, and take those user names and push them into the Widen system and then market to those specific users, letting them know what kind of new system we were creating, what were the advantages of it, and push that out to them
We did a full back cover spread on our very first catalog when we launched the marketing toolbox, identifying what it was, how easy it was to use, and we came up with a quick little slogan to use to try to get them to understand that it was fast, easy and simple, which was basically our slogan that we used
And we highlighted it on that catalog that gets distributed out to about 10,000 addresses, which is a very large audience, to see how many would actually log on to our website, and come in and see the toolbox
We gave that roughly about a couple months to see how that settled in
Then we followed up with an email blast to identify that this new system was here and what were the advantages of using the system
Then we followed up with a survey
We particularly were talking about our catalogs, and our sourcebooks and our marketing materials, but we felt that that was the perfect opportunity to then ask if they had seen the marketing toolbox advertised on the back of our catalog or advertised through our email blast, which gave us some insight as to how many people were really knowledged about it and what step we needed to take to implement further from there and whether we could move into a training position or whether we needed to continue on with our marketing efforts
From that we felt like there was a good enough number of customers who had seen it in the few places that we had put it out, and we moved into our training phase, which was launching WebExes a couple times a week for a few consecutive weeks in a row, and putting out open lines to all of our customers saying that they could attend a particular WebEx

I watched Pablos video and I really agree with him that it is slightly different for CEOs and for doctors and lawyers, I dont have very much to show you.
But the point that Pablo made about the fact that making money should never be the only consideration.
Is something which even the greatest proponents of capitalism, whether its Adam Smith or Wayne Brown made very clear.
Its one thing to make money while you are doing good for your company, for your shareholders, for you workers.
And its another to make money while you are taking your company down the drain.

Hi, this is Laura Turner, and today, were going to talk about how to spot bad dialogue in a play.
Pretty much the easiest way to spot bad dialogue in a play is copious amounts of exposition.
Exposition is the who, what, where, when, and how of a play, and of the characters in the play.
If the characters in the play are spending more time talking about who they are, what their relationships are to one another, and what they have been doing for the last ten years you know that there is more exposition in the dialogue than there is actual action and dialogue that moves forward.
Next, if you see or a play that contains a lot of dialogue that is repetitious, with seemingly no pers purpose; characters talking back and forth to one another and never really gaining any ground.
If youre watching a play that is done in the style of Theater of the absurd this could be the point of the play; that dialogue is meaningless, but if youre not youre probably watching a bad play.

The data is 6 months behind where he is now with his startup company comma
ai saying quote “I believe in being as open as possible without killing the host organism
We make sure we keep the company alive to open source more stuff” George says the key to staying ahead is to Work it harder, make it better, do it faster, makes us stronger, more than ever, hour after our work is never over
Is it safe for me to tinker with an autonomous vehicle modification? Yes with EXTREME caution
It’s a scary thought, if a company like Tesla who’s at the forefront of autonomous driving gets someone killed why would we ever want someone with a hacked together autonomous vehicle modification on the road? Well most people who understand how to piece together their own self driving car are smart enough not to do something stupid enough to seriously harm themselves or others
Most likely the people playing with this open source information are going to start using it in a safe closed course then build up to regular driving but will allow for immediate manual override
As far as the man who died from a fault in Tesla’s most recent autonomous driving iteration, it’s sad and it weighs heavy on Tesla’s conscious
Autonomous driving still requires a driver’s full attention so they can override control of the car in the case of making a mistake like not seeing a tractor trailer
As those intelligent enough to use this open source information to build their own self driving car modification

The name my project is Triangle Dance Marathon.
Triangle Dance Marathon is a dance marathon that we organize at PNC Arena which is where the Carolina Hurricanes play and NC State basketball team play.
And its a dance marathon that sponsors Duke and North Carolina Childrens Hospitals.
All and all we raise a $145,000 for the hospitals.
Its last year it was 6 hours of dancing, basketball, eating, photo booths.
We make cards for the kids and it was a really good time.
The club that Im part of that organize that has about currently 40 some students and then last year we had 260-something come out to the dance.
We encourage other people to volunteer by doing little fundraisers and pep rallies for Dance Marathon.
Like every year have a huge pep rally at our school where we get the whole school in the gym and we give information about the dance marathon.
It makes me feel really good but its not just me that feels good its the kids at hospital and thats whats most important.
So Wagner talked him into building a special theater just for these productions

So, if someone slaps you in the face violently and unexpectedly, you turn red, feel angry and have an indescribable urge to lash out
but if youre younger, that emotion can override your rational decision-making and cause you to do something you might later regret, right

Studies from the University of California Santa Barbara found inducing anger in participants helped them be more analytical
Their findings unexpectedly found that even usually irrational thinkers became careful thinkers when angry
suggesting that anger isnt only a physical fight-or-flight response, but can also focus the mind for decisionmaking
The President will soon propose that Congress enact baseline privacy legislation that will guard against companies collecting and keeping data that they dont need for their business models.
In addition, the President will propose that the FTC and the Department of Commerce supervise the development of enforceable codes of conduct that would be subject to FTC enforcement control.
Hello, Im Cherie Ashwood.
Im a guidance counselor, and today Im going to tell you how to stop having wages garnished to repay a student loan.
French Bull Dogs were one of the most popular dogs in France, at the end of the 19th Century.
They were exceptionally popular with the prostitutes.
Now, one of the reasons was because they were very exotic looking.
They made it very easy for gentlemen to approach the prostitutes on the street, without being hauled away by the police.
Im Mike Campbell, with Doggie Styles, in Beverly Hills, California.
Im here today to talk a little bit about writing a sales plan, and it was an interesting experience for me, attacking a sales plan.
The first thing I did was, a friend of mine lent me a book on writing sales plans.

Its a challenging program you do a lot of reading, you do a lot a lot a lot of writing.
Ive done more papers for sociology classes than I ever thought I would.
But if its something that youre interested in, its definitely worth it.
I just think theres a lot here for them to... to explore right is enough diversity in terms of the student body in terms of faculty interests for them to really kind of develop a sense of their interests.
We try very hard to have a diverse faculty, a range of ages in our faculty from young to...to fairly elderly.
But also, um, a range of nations that people come from a range of ethnicities and a range of views that people have.
Hi my name is Zach Parry
Today I am going to be answering the question, Is it legal to surf the deep web? To answer that questions lets first get an understand what deep web is
Because, when you get on Google on run a research and youre looking for information youre actually surfing the shallow web, if you will

Index meaning, Google has it in their algorithm and it could be a potential search result
The deep web is the unindexed portion of the internet
Its all that information that people put online that doesnt run through Google or that Google or other search engines cannot see
In fact, the vast majority of information online is in the deep web
And a lot of it is pretty benign
Just because the information is uncharted or unmapped downt mean there is anything illegal about it
For example, if you were to get on the Clark County recorders website and you want to search recorded documents associated with a certain parcel number, or were you to get on a Clark County assessors site or the Clark County District Court website and you wanted to search different cases, none of that is indexed
In order to find that, you cant go through Google, you have to go through the portal on respective web sites
So all that public information is unindexed and therefore as part of the deep web
Yet, theres nothing wrong with searching for that information
So, the question really is, what is it that youre looking for on the deep web, because certainly there are illegal activities going on beneath the radar of what is indexed
So, yes it is legal to surf the web
In and of itself, searching this information, and looking at information that is not indexed is not illegal
There is nothing wrong with that
The question is, what is it that youre doing because some of the activities on there, if you were looking for a contract killer, for example, that would be illegal
So the answer depends on what the actual behavior is
But surfing the deep web in and of itself is perfectly legal
You learned in Financial Accounting about the income statement.
There are two approved ways of reporting income to external users.
The Single Step format and the Multi-Step format.
Here is an example of the Multi-Step format.
Note the operating income of $9700. We will refer to that again at the end of this video, but now I wanna introduce you to a new format for the income statement known as the Contribution Margin Income Statement format.
This format is not acceptable for external reporting, but it is used almost exclusively for internal reporting and decision-making purposes.
The Georgetown Institute for Consumer Research, Sponsored by KPMG, has been created.
It is a collaboration of Georgetown Universitys McDonough School of Business and KPMG LLP, the audit, tax, and advisory firm.
CINDY DYER: My name is Cindy Dyer, and I am the Senior Director for Human Rights at Vital Voices Global Partnership.
Vital Voices is co-sponsoring this event, The Courage to Lead, with The Eleanor Roosevelt Project at George Washington University, and it has been such an amazing experience, not only to plan the event, but to attend the event.
The women that are here, not only who are speaking on the panel, but the ones who are participating in the audience, are absolutely so inspiring.
They make me want to get up every day and go to work, and I feel so fortunate to have had this opportunity to spend time with them and to get to know them and to work with them.
example of why you need a Hegemonic structure to actually foster human rights
 Ryerson and UofT went head to head, back and forth, but they both knew that only one could come out on top
After over an hour of competitive debating, constructing and deconstructing points of argument it was time for the judges and the audience to pick the winner
Madam speaker, warden, ladies and gentlemen, we have conferred
And in response to the notion This House welcomes the decline of U

Hegemony we believe Ryerson has successfully defended the notion
 However, even though the judges agreed that Ryerson has successfully defended the notion

You have PowerPoint and of course you have your book as a resource, as well, but sometimes people dont get everything that they need to get from the PowerPoint, but please do watch this video and then go back to the PowerPoint to see much more detailed information.
We have the latest from Utah, where the state has committed to spending millions of dollars to undo marriage equality.
An apology from a Florida governor who has now changed his mind on banning the freedom to marry.
Plus, new promises of yet another federal lawsuit in a conservative state.
For the American Foundation for Equal Rights, Im Matt Baume, and welcome to Marriage News Watch for January 6, 2014. There are several new developments in the Utah case this week.
After a federal judge legalized marriage equality in Utah last month, the state has now hired Idaho attorney Monte Stewart to represent them on appeal.
Republican lawmakers have pledged to spend up to two million dollars of taxpayer funds to try to overturn the freedom to marry, even though the case has already passed what should be its most expensive hurdles.
For comparison, the entire cost of defending DOMA from start to finish was two point three million dollars.
Also last week, the state requested an emergency stay from the US Supreme Court.
If granted, the stay would halt marriage equality during the appeals process.
We could have a decision from the court on the stay any day now.
In the mean time, the appeal of the ruling is moving ahead with a very rapid schedule.
The opening brief is due on January 27th, a response brief is due February 18, then a reply on February 25th, and then oral arguments will follow that.
Although Im at Davos, at best in any light Im an ordinary person who feels the outrage that many people do, most people do when they hear the CEOs receiving huge bonuses, 18.4 billion dollars in bonuses for 2008 performance or lack of performance.
And I think I reflect the outrage of the ordinary citizen who feels very strongly about the notion that we were told that CEOs require those kinds of pay packages because they are tied to performance.
And then we find out that essentially the notion of corporate welfare is stronger than the notion of corporate performance.
I want to share a short testimony with you that I hope touches you as much as it touched me.
We all know that without faith its impossible to be pleasing to the Lord.
And the Lord reminded me of this recently when my wife, daughter, and I went out shopping.
We came home and for the past several months and most of this year my driveway, the walkway out front, and the sidewalks have been snow covered, ice covered at times, just very dangerous.
And when we were walking into the house my little girl, shes six now, she got really nervous.
She got scared because I think she was slipping a little bit.
And I said, honey dont be afraid, just grab a hold of daddys hand.
And immediately she grabbed my hand and all the fear and all the worry, the sound of her voice changed, and she was just totally confident walking into the house because she had her dads hand.
And the Lord spoke into my spirit and He just showed me how Hes reaching His hand out to us.
Hes reaching His hand out to you and to me and Im going to cling to His Hand.
And that is what we must do, cling to the Hand of Jesus with child like faith knowing that nothing is impossible for Him.
Hello everyone, my name is Valerie Jarrett,  and I’m one of the three co-chairs  of President-elect Obama’s Transition committee.
The other two chairs are John Podesta, who was formerly Chief of Staff for President Clinton and Pete Rouse, who was formerly Chief of Staff Senator Obama when he was in the Senate.
So we are very interested in making sure that this transition is transparent, that we are giving information information just in time to those of you who are logging  on to our Change.gov website so that you know what’s going on just as decisions are being made.
Last week, we announced the co-chairs.
President-elect Obama also announced that Rahm Emmanuel  will be his Chief of Staff  and this week we announced several of the key people who are leading the agency reviews.
The Departments of Treasury, State, and Defense  are the three we came out with since of course you know that the economy and national security are two of the key issues that you,  the American people, are concerned about.
So we have a lot of work to do, weve hit the ground running.
President-elect Obama is committed to having an efficient, competent,  well organized, transparent and bi-partisan Transition Team.
We are looking for the best and the brightest around the country  to help the President-elect as he assumes office on January 20th.
STEVE HOCH: How are retailers being influenced and managing things like Facebook and Twitter and things like that?
Because we know that this just creates huge potential for word of mouth.
The next thing we want to do is talk about worthwhile. You have hopefully picked a topic in which you have a strong belief in, or youre excited about, or you want to share it with other people.
What you need to think about at this point is, how will your listeners benefit from what it is that you have to say?
What is worthwhile about your topic?

The main problem were trying to solve, really, is that we all think we live in an english-based world and that was true in 98, but realistically, whats going on is that the internet is diverging when it comes to languages
Ranked second on the list of the Best Corporate Citizens in Government Contracting, Accenture was recently recognized for its proactive and dedicated social responsibility and transparency efforts when supporting and working with government agencies.
- Young people provide an essential perspective in local and state politics, regardless of their political affiliation, they bring with them a fresh world view, one that is dominated by idealism and creativity
Their input would go a long way towards repairing the broken political relationships that currently govern our system, especially in the city of Chicago
After attending an On The Table discussion, I realized that my organization was not the only group of people that thinks this
And thats why we want to partner with the On The Table community
So heres a little bit of information about us
YOUThink politics is a political engagement workshop for local high school students
The non-partisan educational program teaches students about the resources in their communities and how they can influence the political system to create positive change
These kids are the future of our city
Its our responsibility to make sure that their voices are heard
Weve already planned our first workshop in the Champaign-Urbana area where were currently partnering with two local high schools, the local state representative, the Mayor of Urbana, and the University of Illinois
Were gonna put on a fantastic workshop this fall, and were incredibly excited about it
But we dont want to stop there
We want to take our curriculum and our model and replicate it in Chicago, where we will partner with the schools on the south side of Chicago, local politicians, and maintain our relationship with the University of Illinois
We already have a time and a place

Hi, I’m Secretary of Education Pedro Rivera
Welcome to the National Institute for School Leadership’s Executive Development Program E-D-P is a tool that aligns with the work the Department of Education has been doing on a broader scale, and I thank you for participating and further developing your skills, whether you’ve been in the field for a week or a decade

Where did your stepson live now and why do you think an independent apartment community could be a good option in the future?
My son - my stepson - was with us in Vista California.
Thats in San Diego California, and why independent type of living situation would be perfect for him is the socialization.
My name is Marissa Molina and Im from Denver, Colorado.
Ive been living in Colorado for 15 years.
I came to this country and been living as an undocumented person for 15 years.
And when I was going to school it was really difficult for me to find avenues and resources to be able to reach higher education.
It was definitely an uphill struggle and a challenge - one that I worked in changing.
In addition to the very valid point made about monetary matters Islamic banking is also fraudulent another front Nabbi Mohamed Alaahis Salatu Wasallam would sometimes buy goods and he would not have the money to pay for it for.The shop keeper would give him time to pay when you buy in you given time get paid this is called a credit transaction credit transaction.So a credit  transaction is halal in Islam but there is no evidence that the shopkeeper was allowed to raise his price because he had to wait for his money and so credit price and cash price had to be the same if credit price is higher than cash price, higher purchase or Murabaha.If credit price is higher than cash price the difference between the two would be because of time that money can increase over time.
If you believe that money can increase over time you are misguided.
Dangerously misguided because Allah says no money cannot increase over time that transaction is invalid that is Ribah.
But the Islamic  banks now theyre beginning to understand that tide streaming against them so now theyre back to the wall.
So, youre thinking about building your dream home, or perhaps your retirement home, and you want to know how to obtain a loan, in order to do so.
Michael Dobbs: Im Michael Dobbs.
Im a fellow at the Committee of Conscience at the US Holocaust Museum, and Im undertaking a research project that is pegged to the upcoming trial in the Hague of the alleged Bosnian war criminal Ratko Mladic, who is the most prominent of all the people whove been indicted by the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in the Hague.
And I want to ask a series of broader questions, such as, why did the massacre at Srebrenica happen?
Can it, could it have been prevented by the international community?
And what lessons have we taken from the series of trials of former Yugoslav military leaders over the last, over the last decade?
The second suggestion is to use a strategies approach
There are strategies that children can use for thinking about each set of number facts

KPMG has partnered with Georgetown University to launch a new Consumer Research Institute based in Washington D.C.
The new CRI will be established in Georgetowns McDonough School of Business, and the university will establish resident scholars to study consumer behavior and how marketing can change that behavior.
You know, we don’t necessarily think just about digital marketing.
So there is no real perfect major for being pre-health, being pre-med.
As long as you complete all the requirements that you need in order to get into a particular med school.
Your major can be anything from English to Anthropology to Music, Dance whatever you like.
In fact the nice thing about coming into med school with a major that’s not necessarily in the sciences is that you bring a level of diversity to the class.
If you have a major in humanities you have had critical thinking and creativity as part of your curriculum and those are skills which will be wonderful to have as part of a med school class.

SO WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE BIGGEST SECRET THAT YOURE SPILLING IN THE BOOK
WOULD IT BE ABOUT YOUR MARRIAGE
WELL, THATS NOT A SECRET ANYMORE
I MEAN BECAUSE -- BECAUSE TO BE A GAY MAN OR WOMAN, THANK GOD IT IS A MIRACLE, THANK GOD IT IS NOT A SIN ANYMORE
AND THESE PEOPLE CAN HOLD THEIR HEAD UP HIGH AND NOT -- YOU KNOW, WHEN HE TOLD ME ABOUT IT, IT WAS A LONG TIME OF OBVIOUSLY HE WAS FEARSOME AND IT WAS SOMETHING TO FEEL ASHAMED OF AND TO KEEP UNDER THE COVERS, AND NOW PEOPLE CAN BE FULL OF ABOVE BOARD LOVE AND BEING GOOD TO EACH OTHER
AND YOU WERE MARRIED 25 YEARS BEFORE YOU FOUND OUT YOUR HUSBAND WAS GAY
IT WAS A DEVASTATING THING
IT JUST SHOCKED ME SO
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD BE SO DEVASTATED
Hi You Tube, Im Rick Haythornthwaite, Chairman of MasterCard.
And I think in Davos the whole issue about regulation ethics has been a big issue.
My view is very clear, that yes, absolutely, chief executives or senior executives must have a code of ethics.
Promotion is defined as advancement of position, encouragement of the progress, growth or acceptance of something.
Hi, Im Peggy Collins and Im here to help you learn how to promote your event.
Im a firm believer in developing smart partnerships.
Look for the synergies such as media partnerships with local radio stations, TV stations, newspapers and cable companies.
If you dont have a relationship with a reliable account executive whos competent, get on that now, long before your event.
They can provide you great support with related cross promotions and help you develop a strong working relationship with your media partner.
What media partners generally want from you is to own the event, taking sponsorship credit for it in the community with no cash investment and to secure exclusive rights to be on site in exchange for promotion on air or in kind advertising at no cost to you.
Media partnerships are an excellent way to do more with less and you always have less than youd like.
Consider working with related businesses so that both benefit from the team work.
For instance, if your event is a concert, tickets and t-shirts become currency.
Give them out a couple of days before the event to create a little buzz.
Give some to the store owner to give away as contest prizes with register to win materials at the store to help generate traffic.
Whats up i wanted to do a video on the new teaser trailer that Activision released for what one can assume is the new Guitar Hero game.
The trailer is just in the background right now.
Its about a 15-20 second trailer.
And you know it shows a band getting ready to go on stage.
There was some interesting things i noticed about the trailer.
Like the first thing youll see is that there is a guy holding a guitar pick.
And weve heard rumours in the past that the new guitar hero would be much more realistic in its approach to the series.
Maybe it could be something similar with what weve seen with Rocksmith with allowing people to play real guitars.
We do see guitars in the trailer.
We also see a drum kit in the trailer too and towards the very end.
Hi, Im Rebecca Lee, Advisor at the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
The Affordable Care Act provides new options for affordable health coverage that covers a range of benefits, including important preventive services with no out-of-pocket costs for millions of Americans, including the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities.

Hi, Im Tim Roughgarden.
Im a professor here at Stanford and for the past eight years, Ive been teaching the class The Design and Analysis of Algorithms. And Im pleased to say that for the first time were going to be offering this class online, freely available to everybody.
So here at Stanford, the design and analysis of algorithms is the corner stone of the computer sciences curriculum.
How come?
Well, the ideas that you learn in this class are critical for literally every other branch of computer science and not only that also increasingly in the natural sciences in particular in computational biology and even in the social sciences, for example, in economics.
On a more just purely pragmatic level, I have to say that every year when I teach this class several students come up to me afterwards and tell me it was the key class that got them to ace all of the questions in their mechanical interviews.
So, what do you learn in this class?
Well, well start out by talking about the divide and conquer algorithm design paradigm, in particular with applications to fast searching, sorting and multiplication.
Second, well talk about several blazing fast algorithms for manipulating and reasoning about graphs.
Such as computing connectivity information and also shortest paths.
Finally, well discuss randomized algorithms.
So continuing with the bankruptcy theme I wanted to talk about some other brands that have filed for bankruptcy in the last few years
One very notable one is American Apparel, especially since theyve filed bankruptcy twice within the period of a little bit over a year
Thats kind of crazy
Other brands include Pacific Sunwear, Cache, Wet Seal, and Quicksilver
And if you kind of listen to the names of these brands you might figure out that theres a pattern
A lot of these are very teen specific or sort of focus on a younger customer
I think theres sort of three big reasons why these types of companies are having trouble
Number one is that trends are moving a lot quicker than they used to when I was a teenager
Theyre not as stagnant and theres been a huge acceleration over the past ten years of teen trends
The second thing is that teen trends used to be a much more segregated niche
But theyre much more influenced now by the designer runways because of internet easy access to viewing collections online
Teen trends used to be very isolated from runway trends but now with the rise of the internet and also access to cheap runway copies, any potential business for these outdated teen retailers has sort of been absorbed by companies like H&amp;M, Zara, Forever 21, and other online niche brands
The third thing is that social media celebrates diversity
When I was a teenager there wasnt social media and it was much more common to just want to fit in, to look like your peers, to dress like your peers
But today if you want to stand out online you have to be different and how many Instagram followers you have sort of overrides what your peers think of you
So if you are the kid in school that has the most followers out of that anyone else, then you probably are the cool kid in school because you have the biggest following you have the biggest influence
And I think that you know its sort of like just like the the value of sort of businesses, bloggers, and brands are sort of partly based off of the influence they have and how many followers they have teenagers acceptance among peers is also sort of based off of your influence your online influence
And these troubled brands they just really didnt utilize this at least not fast enough
Okay we have talked about the person and the family in this birthday speech.
Were going to talk more about the person but right now what we want to do is talk about them in relation to their work and their work achievements.
What is it that they do?
VENKAT: I got interested in entrepreneurship and teaching entrepreneurship because of my experience that I had early in my career.
Some of the most exciting times Ive had were those two years when I worked for a spin-off of a large company, where we decided to start a new business.
And we spent two years creating something out of basically nothing.
It was chaos.
It was exciting.
We didnt know what the next day would bring.
But all of those experiences that an entrepreneur goes through, the ups and downs, the late evenings and early mornings, I experienced all of that in that two-year time frame.
Hello, so today Im going to speak to you about this product.
We keep each other safe, you know what Im saying
But we cant because we -- you know, the system wants to divide and conquer so they find a way to do that
Once people start caring, even if it doesnt involve them, then they will learn to have that empathy and sympathy for others and then we can learn to protect each other because we would know what that type of pain would feel like
Were all equals in this, you know what Im saying
Its us against them, its not us, us, us, them, them, them, and the big man -- no
For far too long, the greatest predictor of how well you will do at school has been your parents income.
Now thats simply not good enough.
Every child deserves a chance, they deserve a chance to be the best that they can be and thats why the Government is introducing a pupil premium.
Its been in place in schools now for just over six months and today Im announcing that the amount of money available will go up significantly.
Not only is it  increasing to £600 per pupil but also taking in many more students, reaching many more disadvantaged students who deserve that extra chance.
An extra half a million students will be taken into the pupil premium.
The pupil premium is already making a big difference in schools.
Schools are using it to pay for one-to-one tuition, extra catch-up classes,  parent support advisors, all the things we know make a difference for children who are falling behind.
Its simply not good enough that how well you should do at school is so dependent on your parents background.
Peter puts it out there in very plain language, and after you follow what he is doing there and you watch the stocks that he has provided over time you get a certain level of confidence ok, that Peter does know what he is doing!
And I do trust what he is saying.

In the off chance that they actually get this piece of legislation to pass, then that means that the very second Donald Trump is sworn in, he is eligible for impeachment because he has still not divested from his own companies and his children, who will be a part of his cabinet, and at the very least even according to this legislation, theyre still his kids
They wouldnt be able to run his business, but that is Donald Trumps plan right now
Making him in direct violation of this law if it were to ever pass
That is why Republicans wont let it go forward
There are four exchanges used in the  counting method, and these exchanges  are similar, as I was saying earlier, to  borrowing in print.
The exchanges for  addition and multiplication are the  same and the exchanges for subtraction  and division are the same.
These  exchanges for subtraction and division  can be thought of as opposite of  addition and multiplication, if that’s  helpful.
If possible the exchanges of  the beads needs to occur in one movement as you count and move  the beads toward or away from the  horizontal counting bar.
The other  thing to remember about the exchanges  is that they can occur in any column  anywhere on the abacus.
So the four  five exchange just doesn’t happen  in the units column.
Every home office should have a desk, or a work area, where youre going to sit and do your work.
Its very important where youre sitting, and where the door is.
You always want to be sitting in the power position, which is facing the door; so youre actually facing into the room, as opposed to facing into a wall.
One of the reasons is that youre facing your opportunities if youre facing the door, and youre welcoming them.

 Do you have this in a size eight
 Do you have this is another colour
 Do you have this in green
 Youve tried on the clothing, its the right size and the right colour, now you want to know how much it costs
If youre buying one item, you can ask, How much is this
Hey guys, welcome to todays Encourage Mint, which is meant to freshen, your day
Seeing past the flaws
We all have flaws in our life
We are littered with flaws
Some of them are ok
Its like the shape of my head is flawed somehow, but it makes me unique
But there are some flaws that we dont really want to have in our lives, theyre like the flaws of the way we think
Maybe personality traits that you know dont come out right in public when they should, or something
So, I want to encourage you today, when someone youre dealing with has a flaw thats very obvious, most likely theyre working on it, or theyre aware of it
So try to see past the flaw
Dont get all bent out of shape because this thing is eating away at you, the way it presses your buttons or something
If you can see the person in the context of who they are, really, behind that flaw, or who theyre going to be, or who they can be, it will make for a better, better situation
Here are a few thoughts on dealing with late paying clients.
Im John Harrington.
Dealing with late paying clients is the bane of every photographers existence.
Heck, Im sure its the bane of most businesses existence, especially those that deal with people who provide services and then pay at a later date.
In the end ultimately you do need to get paid and the first thing you need to do is if that particular person youre dealing with is not in the accounting department reach out to the accounting department in that company.
Talk to them, ask the invoice is in their system.
My name is Bryan Escareno.
I attended Morton College from 2009 until currently actually.
Its just easier on patients.
There is less stress; there is less memory of the whole event which can sometimes be quite a bit to go through.
Hey Guys, its Donny And no Im not in Toronto Im in Italy! But I want to tell you a little bit about the story of what I just went through Yes, many of you know I bought a house recently And Ive been telling everyone I know


NOW is the time to take advantage of an opportunity I;m serious! And I believe it so strongly that I, myself who is not looking for a home- bought a house! I think opportunity is knocking guys, and that window is gonna get shorter and shorter Now is the opportunity to get int he market and move up and take advantage of some of these prices in the weaker demand
So, anyhow Im walking proof that I walk the walk
Our first investors, I dont know if its the first investor because we had a few on day 1. They were the best possible fit for us.
They shared the same culture as us, the same beliefs.

Hello and welcome to my course about TCP IP socket programming using C# .Net  I am Naeem Akram Malik, a professional computer programmer who has been doing TCP/IP and other socket programming for about ten years.
This course is designed to get you up &amp; running with socket programming very quickly, in a no fuss fashion.
A lot of presently available socket programing courses were  designed &amp; created by the academics.
People who got a lot of experience about teaching &amp; doing theoretical research.
But they dont know what is real world programming.
I am a programmer whos spent a lot of time in the trenches.
I will take you straight to the code in a very short amount of time In my course, you will start writing code within fifteen minutes of joining the course.
Of course youll have to watch it :p My course is divided in several sections.
To fortify the learning experience, Ive also added some quizzes.
In the first section you are going to learn the fundamentals of network programming.
This section will briefly cover the fundamental topics like a Host An IP Address, a Port Number, and things like Telnet We are going to use the Telnet utility in the sectiond section of our course.
In the next section I am going to show you how to create a TCP/IP server.
Hey, My name is Angela.
I just wanted to do a quick review of the Icy Anti-Slip Grips.
I actually have a friend who recommended these to me because I was complaining about slipping on the icy sidewalk up to work.
I was wearing a pair of snow boots, and I hate wearing boots because you have to bring your change of clothes for the office.
And, its my least favorite thing about winter.
So, my friend actually recommended these.
So this is what it looks like.
Its this small little device that has this ceramic pad.
I think you can see all the little ridges in there, thats what keeps you from slipping.
And all you do, you kind of take it, and it stretches out, and you stretch it over any shoes youre already wearing.
So, like for instance, I have these under tennis shoes right now.
And you could see Ive worn them with boots, Ive worn them with tennis shoes, Ive actually worn them with nicer shoes when Im going in to work.
And they fit over every pair of shoes that I own.
Super awesome.
It takes maybe 10 seconds to put them on.

KENT WIELAND: Hello, Im Kent Wieland, WKAR TV Station Manager.
You may be aware that the funding for public broadcasting is being considered for elimination by congress in next years budget.
While this is not the first time this has been considered, the threat of defunding the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has never been more real than it is now.
Its true that federal support is only a part of the funding necessary for public broadcasting to operate.
However, removal of federal support for public broadcasters would be a crippling blow.
This is a story about a boy named Park and a girl named Eleanor who go to school in Omaha, Nebraska.
Eleanor lives with her mother, step-father, and siblings, but was kicked out of the house for about a year by her step-father.
Her family life isn’t too great, as her father abuses her mother and verbally abuses her.
Since she is the new girl, Eleanor has no place to sit on the bus, but Park eventually lets her sit next to him.
As weeks go by, Park and Eleanor develop a friendship based on their love of music and comics.
They eventually talk to each other every day on the bus to and from school.
One day, they start holding hands and their feelings for each other blossom into a romance.
Their relationship develops from hand-holding to kissing, but several conflicts come up along the way, including Eleanor discovering perverted messages in her schoolbooks and Park bringing up a past relationship with a popular girl.
During the holiday break, Eleanor spends more time with Park and his family, nearly going to his house every day.
Park’s mother even offers to give her a free makeover, although Eleanor doesn’t really like it.
Their relationship begins to get more physical, but Eleanor’s step-father discovers her relationship with Park and is upset.
Eleanor also figures out that her step-father has been the one writing those perverted messages in her books.
Eleanor decides to run away and Park takes her to her uncle’s house in Minnesota.
They say good bye, but Park promises to write letters.
However, Eleanor decides not to read them or write back.
In the end, life goes on for both Eleanor and Park, but she finally writes back after over a year of silence.
As always, a lot can be said about this story, but what draws my interest and attention is the idea that while Asian women are sometimes portrayed in the media as desirable, we don’t really see a lot, if any, Asian men as objects of desire.

If you said anata to aitakatta, youd be saying something more, I think, like Ive been wanting us to get together, Ive been wanting us to meet together

Hello my name is Penny Smith and Im a North Carolina Real estate broker.
Today Id like to talk to you about how to get construction financing.
You found your perfect piece of property and now you want to build your dream home on it.
Whats the first step you need to do.
It’s the bedrock of all rights, because if you don’t have legal capacity, then your rights are taken away
And so for us it’s been a huge priority in our work to ensure that people will not have their legal personhood stripped
The fact that persons from the movement are more and more involved into politics, policy, and working internationally, that will at some point bring better results
So, we are now in a—let’s say—new phase where we are in a possibility to use both CRPD and the Agenda 2030 to move the rights of people with disabilities forward
Because of the convention, governments have much more awareness about disability issues
They know they should do something
They don’t always know what to do
Hi there!
Im Karen Nguyen, director of small business marketing at Rogers, and Id like to invite you to the Rogers Business Forum.
The next thing I want to talk about is something that you actually dont want to do.
And what you dont want to do is to respond defensively.
What Im talking about when I say respond defensively, Im talking about, a person says to you, well I just wasnt convinced by your argument, and instead of saying, okay, why, well thats because you dont know anything about these arguments anyway, okay, okay.
All right, thats responding defensively.
So I think that many times when you ask an entrepreneur, when an entrepreneur asks me what investors should I pick up, or how should I choose my investors?
The first answer I give them is just like that, just like I expect you fast as possible.
You should expect your investors to move the fast as possible.
In between getting a great investor in three months, or getting a good investor now, go for the good investor now.
And then fulfill the rest of your needs in terms of people that will help you through advisors or anything else.
I think that this is good advice in general, because as I said, speed is the most important thing.
If you dont have money, you cannot move.
In many cases, you cannot hire more people.
And so this is really critical.
Having said that, youve gotta make sure that you dont get investors in that basically become a liability on the company.
And the kind of investors that could become a liability on the company, are those that are either very bad in the way they manage the relationship with the founders.
Thats one thing.
Or they will demand all kind of terms that would basically take away either the control of the destiny of the company or slow down the company.
And so, when I see investors that are requiring extreme veto rights, or theyre requiring to be the ones approving stuff, or investor Ive even seen investor that say I want to sign on amounts of the company spends above a certain level.
RM: I LOVE YOU~ Jin: Are you say Hyung-nim, thank you
Im financial adviser Patrick Munro talking today about how to find the best annuity companies.
What you want to do, is do your research, and insurance companies are the companies that do manage annuities.
What you can do is go on to rating services on the web.
Please explain your answer in detail and what you would, or would not do
I feel strongly that on or off duty, every firefighter is a representative of his or her department
I also believe that its not my place to contact ranking officials of other departments in order to address personnel issues that may or may not exist within that department

Once you understand an industry, you can think about how your skills and abilities would fit in.

Hi, my name is Adam Franklin from you U-RAAW Custom Health Foods and just wanted to take a couple minutes to put together a quick video testimonial about the OpenCart Mobile framework extension Literally saved me close to $2000 the real reason... I mean, its a very very effective extension, but the real reason why I had to put this testimonial together was because of the support that I received.
Best support Ive ever experienced with any software application... anything that I purchase online, to be honest They literally help me until I got everything working and looking exactly how I wanted.
Leadership of Board committees is a really important part of their success.
The Governance Committee on most Boards is responsible for helping to populate the Board with all of the needs that it has and should be looking long term for the talents that it needs to meet the different needs of each of the committees.
The selection is usually made by the Board Chair for committee chair leaders.
So the Board Chair is the person who invites and makes the decision about committee chairs.
Usually its with the advice and recommendation of a Governance Committee.
Some Boards have a tradition of having Vice Chairs for the Board as well as for committees.
Hi, it’s Andrea Putting with Business Soul Food.
Let’s talk about values.
Have you ever considered what your personal values are?
I think the most important point, where I want to start, is that: Dont look at the native speaker as if theyre up here, and better than you in any way, because sadly, that is why a lot of people get awkward and stop talking around native speakers because they think: The native speakers English is just so good, Im going to sound like an idiot next to them
 And thats why they close down and go quiet

Hi, this is Larry Jordan.
Lets answer another Final Cut Studio question.
Sandra writes, I have twelve GB of system memory, yet when Im working on a complex project  FCP will give me out of memory flags.
What is this?
This is especially frustrating when I have sent the project to compressor and Ive already spent an hour processing I  get the failed response.
My life is over, Im going to start walking in front of large moving buses. Phew, wow, thats a lot of responsibility.
Sandra, the fact that youve got twelve gigabytes of ram on your system does not mean Final Cut takes advantage of it.
The way that Final Cut is currently written and why were all looking forward to a rewrite is that currently Final Cut only accesses four gigabytes of RAM, regardless of how much RAM you have on your computer.
In fact, having RAM on your computer is only  part of the equation.
Once the RAM is there, the programmers need to write  the program to take advantage of the extra RAM.
This is the big reason why thirty-two bit versus sixty-four bit is such a big deal.
Programs were written originally with a thirty-two-bit limitation.
That is to say that the most RAM they could access was four gigabytes, thats what that thirty-two bit refers to, is how much RAM a program has access to.
By opening up the RAM from thirty-two bits to  sixty-four bits, the RAM goes from four gigabytes into the petabyte range, I mean its just vast beyond words to describe, which means probably by next week well figure out a way to fill it up     but the fact is, Final Cut needs to have its software actually recoded, rewritten to be able to support   the additional RAM that youve got.
So the reason youre getting an out of memory is that youre filling that four gigabyte limit.
Now its even smaller than that because one point five gigabytes of that four gigabyte RAM is tied up with what are called frameworks, stuff the application needs to be able to function, and only two point five gigabytes is available for your data.
The out of memory flag exists because your Browser is so full of stuff, either clips or sequences, and probably sequences, that is filling that two point five gigabyte limit to the point where Final Cut cant function.
The way you solve this problem is to get rid of clips in the Browser and get rid of sequences in the Browser that you no longer  need.
The most commonly asked questions by AdWords advertisers is why arent my ads showing? Its a legitimate concern, but there is an equally legitimate response coming from Google.
There are three distinct reasons why you may not be seeing your ads.
The first is your previous search history.
The second is a budgetary and billing concern, and the third is your actual selection of delivery methods.
Budgetary and billing concerns are often the most overlooked reasons as to why your ads are not delivering.
In AdWords, daily and monthly budgets are set to reflect what you would like to see from your campaign spend.
If your daily or monthly budget has been depleted your ads will no longer show as its simply a factor of the click costs you can accrue within your budget.
Make sure to check your billing tab if your ads arent showing.
Its possible that there is an issue with the method of payment, an outstanding balance, or something thats causing the credit card to not process.
This is a definite reason why your ads will not be showing.
If your billing cannot be processed Google cannot show your ads.
Your previous search history can effect your delivery profoundly.

What a viewer doesnt realize is that whats in focus is actually the mirrored image of the woman
Its not the actual image of the woman

SECRETARY KERRY: First, we discussed North Korea’s increasingly provocative actions.
The nuclear test that the DPRK conducted last month and its subsequent ballistic missile launches are provocative; they are threatening; they are a violation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions.
Before we learn how to make better computers we need to learn what better means for computers and how do we measure that.

Then we will look at how to measure performance of real computers using benchmarks and a few general ways to get good performance.
The City of LA is engaged in a debate over its current email system provided by Novell, its the Novell Groupwide email system.
And the proposed Google enterprise system.
Novells program is paid for, in fact there is  an upgrade that we havent put to work and the Googles proposal  is gonna cost us $7 million.
LAs commitment or willingness to engage in an investment in technology  I think is misplaced.
My name is Glen Neeley, Ogden DUI Defense attorney.
Today’s DUI tip I want to talk a little bit about requesting a drivers license hearing.
Once you are arrested, since I know it’s been a long night, you are given lots of instructions by the police officer, where to get your car, do this, do that, or you got to bail out.
Now there is one important instruction he should have given you at least, and that is to request a drivers license hearing.
Its another Sunday Funday And I am here with my source of inspiration on everything Daytime TV, Big Sue.
And I am here to tell you that we are up to, over 50% funded with the Kickstarter!!! Thats amazing!
So Thank you to everyone who has donated it has been an amazing journey so far and I cant wait... theres 18 days left and... Its gonna rock!
&gt;&gt; My area of specialty is in cancers of the head and neck.
And as you can imagine, you know, in the head and neck region theres a lot of very important structures, their eyes, swallowing muscles, nerves, brain, spinal cord, salivary glands.
And the precision of treatments over the last 15 years has just increased the margins.
The distance we have to treat around where the cancer is because of uncertainties is so much less now than what it was before.
We, in reality, our patients now are imaged every day.
We feel that were precise to within a couple of millimeters.
And so we can incredibly precisely target their tumor.
The ability to take a patient who has a tumor of the tonsil or the tongue base or the larynx and treat them with radiation, spare function, so spare them a laryngectomy where the entire voice box is removed and still cure their cancer with radiation is incredibly powerful.
I think the most important thing with patients is to be honest and to, you know, be up front about what they should expect.
You know, the treatments that we give are not easy to get through.
Have a construction or manufacturing project that requires weather protection from snow or wind?
You dont have to spend a large amount of money or lose time to construct a conventional building.
A smart and cost effective solution is a temporary fabric shelter that provides protection from the snow, contains an area, or serves as commercial storage space.
A temporary building or shelter from Shelter Structures, Inc.
is the perfect alternative to traditional buildings.
&gt;&gt; Well, after spending three days here at the World Economic Forum in the India Economic Summit, I think its very realistic India can become a superpower.

Hi this is Eric Sterns with Expert Village and Im going to be talking today about signaling specifically visual signaling and the use of fire in that process.
Fire is a very useful tool for all sorts of things.
When discussing it for signaling you want to eliminate the standard things that you would use with respect to a shelter fire.
You dont want to use a fire reflector because that blocks the light from being seen from a few directions so you want to have a fire that is open.

Hey, hows it going?
My name is Victor Macias.
I am the co-founder of Malestandard.com, and today I am excited because I have another product to review for you guys.
This time, the good folks over at Axe have asked us to review their new Apollo line.
So I have the shampoo and conditioner here and I have the new deodorant here.
So in Male Standard fashion, the first thing we did was we looked at the shampoo and conditioner and we examined the scent.
Now what I have here is the Fresh scent.
And if youve seen reviews in the past or read the reviews on our website, youll see that we are big fans of subtle scents when it comes to shampoos and conditioners or body washes.
Now the main reason is because a lot of us like to wear cologne at night.
So if you have a really overpowering scent, it will clash and just create something thats really not what we wanted.
So what we liked is it definitely has that fresh, light scent.
It almost has like a spearmint type of scent to it, and after using it, you could subtly smell it, but it wasnt overpowering.
And it cleans very well.
It definitely created a good lather and left my hair feeling really good and really clean.
Next up is the Axe 24 hour deodorant.
Now this is the same scent.
Its the Fresh, but it is noticeably stronger.
Now thats not necessarily bad, especially if youre a fan of the scents of Axe and you plan to wear a body scent after.
This could be your primary scent to wear after you go to the gym or something.
It definitely, it worked.
Im not an overly sweaty person, but I did feel dry, and when I wore this product I did not wear any other fragrances with it.
And I got a lot of good compliments actually from it.
One definitely from my girlfriend, and its not just because shes my girlfriend because I have tried other products and have not had favorable results sometimes.
So this is definitely something good.
But what really excited me was the campaign that they told us about.
Now if you go to Wal-Mart and you purchase a package of specially marked Apollo Axe, youll find a code.
With that code, youll be able to go to a special website and the link is going to be at the bottom of this YouTube video, and itll also be on malestandard.com, and you enter the code.
If you select a winning package, you could win a trip to space.
I mean, how many of you have seen those commercials from Axe where its showing the astronaut and the girls going all crazy for the astronaut?
That could be you if you enter the code, if you purchase the right product.
So overall, for an Axe product, we definitely dug it.
Weve tried different Axe products and Id say this is our favorite so far, especially the scent.
The Fresh scent is really good.
And the opportunity to go into space is awesome.
So we will be posting this video on Malestandard.com with a more in-depth written review and the link to sign up for the Apollo space camp.
To enter for the chance to win is at the bottom of this video and will be on our website.
So thanks again for watching.
Please remember to leave a comment and subscribe to our channel and visit Malestandard.com.
Thank you very much.
SECRETARY KERRY: But the dominant truth about the situation in Syria is that, although Assad and Daesh are supposed to be bitter opponents, they are both parts of the same problem.
In fact, the rise of Daesh is directly attributable to the policies and actions of the Assad regime, and that is why we have referred to Assad as a magnet for terrorism.
This is a case, and there are many in history, in which two supposed enemies are in fact symbolic.
Loathing towards Assad drove thousands of Syrians into the arms of Daesh.
And fear of Daesh caused some Syrian groups to feel that they had no realistic option but to support the government.
That’s not just symbolic; that’s a symbiotic relationship, each piece dependent on the other.
And the desire to flee both explains the massive refugee crisis that we face today.
The relationship between Assad and Daesh clarifies one of the apparent peculiarities of this conflict – that the two extremes have only rarely targeted one another.
Think about that.
Hi Im Bill Meub.
What does it mean to be a Republican.
I think one of the best ways to talk about what it means to be a republican is to take people that republicans best identify as the leaders who are republicans.

Now why do I say that

Financial aid is available for international students .We do expect that the international students will notify us if they do intend to apply for financial aid at the time that they submit their admission application.
And we do want all financial aid forms to be submitted at the same time that the admission application is submitted.
We will consider then, just like we do for domestic students , an international student’s parents income and assets and then make a determination of what that family contribution will be over four years.
This is different, a little bit different for international students in that we do set that family contribution for four years and it is not adjusted and an international student would not need to reapply for financial aid once they have had a family contribution set for them.
In the financial aid that we award, we would be awarding a combination of loans and work study and grants or scholarships.
Hi everyone this is Aparna with Investors Business Daily with an ETF market update.
On Wednesday the major index tracking exchange traded funds edged lower.
The minutes from the Federal Reserves July meeting are expected at 2 PM Eastern.
Despite the cautious mood in the markets overall, SPDR S&amp;P Bank ETF rose modestly in early trade.
In recent days, some key Fed officials have indicated that at least one rate hike could be coming this year, which is good news for banks.
My name is Jose Algrin.
This year nearly 300,000 Americans will study somewhere outside our borders and nearly 1 million students will come to the United States for a world-class education.
These numbers tell us an exciting story.
Even in an age when we can take a virtual trip to far-flung places just by clicking a mouse, we still want to see the world for ourselves and discover our common bonds first-hand.
At the Department of State weve always recognize the power of studying abroad to build bridges of understanding.

For those of you already pursuing an education abroad Im very grateful and wish you well.

In developed economies the youth unemployment rate will decline in the next 5 years, from the current 17.5% to 15.6% in 2017. This decline is mainly related to the fact that increasingly young people are dropping out of the labour market, as they find it more and more difficult to find a job.
Young people dropping out of the labour market are actually not counted anymore as unemployed, as they are inactive.
What they often do is staying at home, until the times get better.
In developing economies, where this phenomenon is very wide spread, young people are starting to take up informal activities.
This is a phenomenon that we might see in some developed economies, especially those where the situation for young people is extremely severe.
“Once I learned everything that Ms
Barber could offer, and how responsive her girls are to her and the needs of the team, it’s been an incredible fit the last couple years

Whenever the team reports we’re here 30 minutes prior to them, getting things ready
They fix equipment, they do laundry, it’s unlimited, unlimited jobs that we do here
” The Rockets certified athletic trainer is Victoria Simonetti, and she also relies on the help of the managers
“A lot of times when football practice is going on there’s other home events
So they’re out at every practice, so they’re kind of an extra set of eyes for me, they’re great, they give me a call, so and so’s down, so and so needs help
What do you want me to do to get the process started
We produce a huge quantity of waste every year
And this waste we throw away for good
What we want to do with the circular economy is to recycle waste to obtain raw materials, and also make sure that products are designed to last and can be reused and recycled, in order to have a higher value in their entire life cycle
It is clear that if we raise our recycling targets and we create the conditions for a high quality recycling system, we will obtain raw materials that instead of ending up in a landfill enter the cycle, the market
This means that waste has a value, the waste is not a burden anymore but becomes an economic asset
If it is an economic asset, it means that we will pay more attention to it, both when we recycle at home and and also when companies begin their manufacturing process
Hello, my name is Vic Schumacher, with HPE Financial Services.

Our recipients of those microloans, they do not use those loans efficiently.
And so the idea is if you provide training, basic business training, to those loan recipients say it would, you know, it would improve their well-being.
We’re talking about people who live in the poorest on less than a dollar a month for example and a day, less than a dollar a day.
So basically, there are many different training programs; and when you start studying the effect of those programs, you find it often the fact is actually negative like on special or something such as profitability or no effect on things such as consumption.
It seems that programs do more bad than good, which is really counterintuitive and surprising.
The changes in on line marketing are actually defining what my job is.
Head of business development for a company that’s a data driven on line marketing platform.
Hi, this is Luis for expertvillage.com and were going to be talking about pawn shops.
Today Im here at Inland Jewelry and Loan.
The greatest piece of advice I can tell anybody who goes into a pawn shop is; check your attitude at the door.
[music] Jamie Gruman: I think the main strength of the program is that it can be completed in a reasonable amount of time, and you finish the program with very solid, strong research skills that allow into you to take those skills either into industry or into an academic job
Not only do you get a top-notch, research-based education, you get to build a connection with faculty that really take an interest in promoting your development
Ruben Burga: The students benefit from the interaction with the professors, and this interaction is in the hallway, it is not necessarily a formal interaction, but as you meet up with the professors you start getting a sense of what I should do in my case because they share ideas, or I share my ideas and they give me feedback
So the culture is very supportive
The culture is very dynamic
People are interested when you actually publish something, or when you present something, and its always questioning the big why are you doing this
Now through the process of doing my own research I worked a lot with specific professors and advisors, and they helped to refine my thinking about where I wanted to go
Jamie Gruman: Weve had students investigate a wide variety of issues, in the program
Weve looked at IT project management, weve had students looking at accountability in public organizations, weve had students doing research on leadership in military organizations
One of my students is currently investigating the role of psychological capital, which is hope, optimism, confidence and resilience in entrepreneurship, and does psychological capital lead to more success among entrepreneurs? Ruben Burga: My research really focuses on project management and the management controls that are used by project managers to be able to create a successful project out of their existing projects
My niche is really in organizational leadership but I work at the intersection of a couple of spheres
One, I work a lot with social entrepreneurship, which is something that deals with corporate social responsibility and how to do good in a way that actually creates good business value
I also deal in the field of managing organizations and managing projects, so I look at that intersection with social entrepreneurship
And finally, I also look at high technology or information technology and how that impacts how we manage companies, how we manage information, and how we manage people
Jamie Gruman: A lot of the work that we do is very heavily applied, and so you can take the skills that youre gaining here and use them, either for an academic career or a career in the world of practice
Ruben Burga: Ive been able to go through academic conferences overseas, and also within Canada, to be able to present my research
Ive also been able to participate in award-winning papers that have resulted from different aspects of my research
My last two papers actually resulted from having participated in research that originated at the University
A co-author and myself sat together with our advisor and created some research that really delved into conceptually, how do students learn? That related back again to some of the research I was doing towards organizational leadership
Jamie Gruman: What I like the most about working with the PhD students is theyre skilled and theyre hungry
They want to learn
Thank you so much for joining me today on our healthy version of how to do snacks right.
I have my nut mixture, almost like a trail-mix going on over here.
I have my yam chips, and youll see its a very small amount because I keep eating them.
Anytime that I disappear for a second Im eating more of these yam chips, theyre so yummy.
Im going to be slicing up some more in about ten minutes.
These are both great things to have on hand with you.
Again, the two tips that I really encourage you to invest some time in: plan and prepare, that may mean some cooking at home.
GDay I just saw Godzilla in 3D and I left the Cinema a bit disappointed but not get me wrong I am still giving this movie let me start with the good things when Godzilla is shown full screen first time and roar it really made you tremble , shake ! it is awesome, Bryan Cranston with the little screen time that he gets, it is very good!
All right, we are talking about different types and styles of dress and wardrobe choices, and we just briefly talked about business casual.
Now I want to talk about the opposite of that which is commonly referred to as elegant and refined.
Before we started working with CENTORRINO Technologies we had a local firm that worked with us
Same gentleman most of the time came
It was a little limiting
He didnt have a knowledge of how the CEO worked and what the requirements were
And so we just found that he just couldnt service us the way we needed to
We found out about CENTORRINO Technologies through a couple of other schools, one in Torquay who were using CENTORRINO Technologies at the time and another one up in the western area
They were using CENTORRINO as well and had good reports back about those so we thought wed have a chat
What CENTORRINO Technologies have done for us is really been able to give us surety in how our system works
Before CENTORRINO Technologies I had to go down to the server every night before I left and throw another tape into back it up and take these with me and it was often you would forget those sort of things
It was always a constant worry that it wasnt actually working
And now everything is backed up offsite by CENTORRINO Technologies and we dont have to worry about it and I know that it is there because we have had to retrieve it before
So what we get with CENTORRINO Technologies is an overall package
We pay a fixed fee and we get unlimited support - thats phone support, people coming down to work on our system or email support
It means that we can look to the future as well and bring on new systems or new products and they are going to be able to service those
We added some iPads earlier this year and they are going to be managing those for us into the future
It just means that we can bring our technology forward without having to worry about knowing how to manage it
Weve got Mac and PCs here
We are leaning towards more of a Mac school and thats been something that has been a real bonus for us
Having someone from CENTORRINO Technologies who understands Macs
We had a lot of trouble in the beginning to get that to happen but now that weve got someone who comes down here regularly to work on those
It just meant they are a lot easier to run
For teachers and students it really again means that they can most of the time be sure if our network is up because everything is working properly - that they can just run their day
Teachers can just come to school, know that if they want to run a YouTube clip for the children first thing in the morning, that it is going to work
That if they want to connect up to their interactive whiteboard that they know that its going to work
The children when they are sent off to use the iPads or the computers know that they are going to work
And thats what makes teaching so much easier
And from my perspective as an administrator, Im also the IT person here it means that I am not running around trying to fix things, because they just work
Yes, I will recommend CENTORRINO Technologies and have in the past recommended them
I believe that they have the ability to know what the needs of our schools are
I tend to prefer that type of arrangement (sponsorship) rather than kind of random advertising because, if youre signed up with a random group of advertisers you never really know what you are going to get in your podcast and Im always a little worried, as a producer, of getting that one ad that just offends my entire audience and destroys the listenership I have.
MR KIRBY: On to the bombings in Iraq, the United States condemns the bombings yesterday claimed by Daesh of a market in Sadr City, Baghdad, which killed over 70 people and wounded – right now looks like more than a hundred.
We also condemn Daesh’s attack on security personnel in the Baghdad neighborhood of Abu Ghraib.
Frankly, we see this kind of – these kinds of attacks as an act or acts of desperation by Daesh, targeting Baghdad as they are to sow fear after it’s been largely forced out of Ramadi.
Hope you had a lot of fun working with the Pirate Fleet app.
This was the first presidential election I actually got to vote in so it was really monumental to me as a student and as an American.
I actually worked the polls so I was here all day, in the pouring rain, watching people vote and I just decided to be a part of history today and to watch it.
That works your chest and your back, Lacey confirmed

your core, firmly place your hands down on the table top and twist from side to side until you start to feel the burn before your next meeting
You can even optimize that wait on the printing queue by standing and doing leg lifts, then going up and down on your toes to work your calves
All of these exercises are jean friendly and guarantee getting in some fitness time even on work hours

Hi everyone, its Alejandra.
And I want to talk to you today about business cards.
So I work with a lot of clients as a professional organizer and the one common denominator between all of my clients are these little stacks of business cards just like everywhere in the house, in the kitchen, the entrance way, the bathroom, the office, the toy room.
Like why are there business cards in the toy room?
Your kids dont want to play with Joe Smith, the plumbers business card.
They want to play with Mr. Potato Head, LEGOs and dress-up.
So its time to gather all those cards that dont belong in the places where theyre currently at and put them in a system that is going to be easy to put away, easy to find, and easy to grab when its time to look for that card to contact that person that youve been meaning to contact for months.
So Im going to show you what I do.
Since Im a business owner, I go to a lot of networking events and I go to a lot of workshops and Im constantly meeting new people and exchanging business cards.
And when I do that and I get a new card, I come home, I empty my purse and I put my cards into this jar that I got from the craft store.
Hi, Im Keeley Selvage with Keeleys Skin Solutions.
Ive been a clinical aesthetician for over half a decade, and Im going to talk to you about whether or not hemorrhoidal cream can help wrinkles.
Hemorrhoidal cream, you know you have some in your closet.
The reason it works so well is because most have steroids in them.
What steroids do is theyre a natural anti-inflammatory and they actually also thin the skin.

Hey guys, this is David over at A Secure Life
Today were doing a review of Frontpoint Home Security Systems
Frontpoint is actually been our #1 pick for 9 years running
And this is primarily due to their incredibly high levels of customer service and the way that they handle their sales process - its a lot lower pressure than some of the other companies out there
Were going to do a deep dive and go into what really sets Frontpoint apart from its competitors and what youre going to get if you do decide to go with Frontpoint
Frontpoint Security Systems are both 100% wireless -meaning that the sensors in your home all wirelessly communicate to your control panel - as well as 100% cellular monitoring - which means that a burglar cant cut your phone line and bypass the security system
If youre in a very rural area you may or may not be able to get monitoring service where you live so just make sure to call and check with Frontpoint
Unlike some other companies, Frontpoint has done a really great job of being transparent with their pricing and their fees
You can see all of them on their website
They also offer a 30-day money-back guarantee which will allow you to test out the sensors and the system in your home
They are not the cheapest option on the market when it comes to monitoring, but we feel that they have a really great overall value
So if youre okay with paying just a tiny bit more, but getting great customer service and a great customer experience, we think youll really like them
So weve talked about it throughout the entire review, but honestly what sets Frontpoint apart is customer service
So weve actually done quite a few phone calls that were mystery shopping Frontpoint - making sure that we understood how they treat their customers when it comes to tough issues or complaints or sales
And we were really impressed by how much time they were willing to take, by how patient they were and how little pressure there was during the sales process
It was focused around answering questions instead of trying to up-sell us home automation or an extra camera
Frontpoint uses a combination of cutting edge technology, equipment and customer service all at a great price
Its a really hard combination to beat, and for the last 9 years, nobody has
You are either recently incorporated or you are in the process of incorporating and you hear the term corporate bylaws.
Hello Im Robert Todd and Im here to answer the question what are corporate bylaws.
