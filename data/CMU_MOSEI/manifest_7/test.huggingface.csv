Hi there,0
Today we're going to be reviewing Cheaper by the Dozen which is (umm) the original version,0
There's a second movie out now but this is (uhh) Steve Martin in the first role,0
It tells the story of (umm) a family with twelve kids and his attempts to raise them,-2
"(umm) Includes Hillary Duff, Bonnie Hunt, Tom Welling and Piper Parabo",-2
(umm) All names that should be familiar with kids and some adults and so this kind of makes the movie have wide appeal,2
"I didn't really like the movie, I thought it was cheesy",1
I think Steve Martin's done other better things,0
Ebert and Roper apparently said two thumbs up here on the cover but for me it's probably two thumbs down,1
"(umm) The humor seemed kind of contrived, kind of, you know, slapstick",-2
(uhh) The dad's getting hit by the kids or someone's acting up sort of thing,0
Not all that funny and not all that original and I didn't think the acting was all that great either,0
But who knows? I (umm) am probably tougher on movies than a lot of people,0
This was pretty popular (umm) and it's a good choice for like I said kids or families,1
(umm) So if you're looking for something it's sort of lighthearted,-2
(umm) It's only PG,-1
Cheaper by the Dozen is a good place to look,-3
But for me it only gets two stars out of five,-1
"Hi, I'm doing my video opinion for Wolf's Rain Loss",0
"This is the third DVD in the series and it contains (uhh) four episodes episodes eleven, twelve, thirteen and fourteen",0
It's very good,2
It continues the story,3
It keeps the (uhh) It keeps up the expectations that (uhh) came to be expected from the first two DVDs of the series,0
And (uhh) it introduces (umm) a couple new characters (umm) new situations and it really adds a lot to the story,2
You start learning more about the story,3
It's a really great (uhh) collection of the episodes on the third DVD,1
"And if you enjoyed the previous two DVDs, you have to continue the story",1
Because (uhh) great story,2
Overall I would give it a five out of five stars because I have the previous two DVDs,0
And (uhh) It's just a great story so you have to continue the whole thing,2
"But some of the things that happened in the third DVD Loss are the nobles really start eating up the world with the wolves and (uhh) some things happen with (uhh) Blue, you'll know who she is from the third DVD, and (uhh) Quent",1
They're just (uhh) great DVDs,2
This is my review of a movie currently in theaters and that movie being Evan Almighty,0
I was a huge fan of the original film Bruce Almighty but I did think it was funny,1
"Like Jim Carey, Morgan Freeman and I like Steve Carell too so I figured okay you know the sequel will be pretty good",-2
"Then I heard that it was gonna have like a, it was going way over budget, it was going to be two-hundred and fifty million",-2
"Then I was thinking I don't know how a comedy can really be two-hundred fifty million but you know, I guess with all this hype it's worth seeing",-3
And I'm afraid it wasn't,-1
(umm) All the money they seem to have spent on a giant arc and a bunch of live animals,2
"There seems to be a ton of CG but there also seems to be a ton of real animals and I'm not sure why they would have blown all that money when they could have just you know CG's it all, because the animals really weren't that impressive",1
"It's definitely geared towards kids, the story isn't as well done, as Bruce Almighty, seems to have targeted even a younger crowd",-1
"Like, I mean there's a lot of animal poop jokes in there that really didn't need to be there",-1
"There's definitely better ways to go about humor than making you know really unfunny jokes, and there's a lot of moments like that",-1
"The story sucks, the characters were really wooden and plain and I liked some of the actors and actresses, so I'm not sure what was going on there",-1
It just seems like a really lousy effort by everybody and (uhh) I guess the box office is reflecting that,0
"Unfortunately, it seems like it'll be a good bomb",-2
My children and I recently went to see the movie Surf's Up,0
(umm) I was very disappointed in it,-2
It (uhh) was a commentary,-1
"It was a cartoon, of course, but it was kinda like a commentary",-1
The penguin was being interviewed about things that had happened in the past,-2
It did not hold the attention of my five year old,1
She was ready to leave when it was half over,-2
"(umm) We were at the drive in and it was the first movie and there was another movie coming, so there was no way we could leave",0
It used (uhh) words that I don't like my children to use,0
"(umm) even though they're not considered curse words, (umm) they were using the word (uhh) poop and crap (umm) things like that",0
People or (uhh) the penguins were passing gas,-2
(umm) Just some untasteful things in the movie,-2
"And in my opinion, (umm) too, I think we've had enough (stutter) penguin movies made in the last year",-1
(umm) I've had my fill of it,-2
"So, I would highly recommend that you save your money",-1
"Hi, (umm) today the product that I'm going to review is a DVD",0
"This is how, (stutter) called (umm), South Park Bigger, Longer, and Uncut",0
"(umm), I don't like this movie",-2
"I give it probably about a two, (umm) because of some of the language it contains",-2
"And, it's the story about four friends, (umm), Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman, who sneak into an, X-rated or R-Rated movie, and it kind of warps their mind and then, for some reason their parents start a war against Canada or something",-1
"And it's about the four boys trying to save (umm), some sort of Armageddon between us and Canada",0
"It's an animated film, probably about an hour and a half, maybe two hours long",1
"It's, (umm) as I said I don't like it, I'd give it about a two",-2
It's not appropriate for kids because there's a lot of cursing and things in it,-1
"But, if you're interested in owning this, you can find it on amazon dot com",-1
"Hi, this is my movie review of the movie (stutter) License to Wed starring Mandy Moore",1
"(umm) This is a movie I though was going to be pretty funny because the trailer looked pretty funny and it's got you know Robin Williams, which I personally like and thought you know he's gonna bring some entertainment to this movie",-1
But I didn't really like this movie at all,-2
It was boring,-2
(stutter) The plot It was like it didn't have a plot,-2
It was just they are trying to you know create all these things to make you laugh but I don't think it was funny at all,-1
"Even the robotic baby part was supposed to be funny, it didn't turn out to be funny in the film",-1
It looked funny in the clip for the trailer but didn't seem funny at all,-1
"And (umm) you know Mandy Moore's character is kind of like, you feel like her character's unrealistic because what type of girl would go that hard core to you know to get married in this church and it just seemed unrealistic and she gets all in a hissy fit and it's just really really tiring and stressful movie",-1
And it wasn't and I feel like the characters were underdeveloped,-1
They're you don't like any of the characters,-2
You don't connect with any of the characters,-1
And It felt like the you know there's like just a little bit just way too typical of a boring film that tries really hard to be funny but it's just not funny at all and it's not it's not (stutter) witty,-2
"It it's (stutter) not even romantic you know in a way that, the way it's written it's like how can someone you know go that hard",-3
It's just like at the end when you're done with the movie you don't even believe in the original premise of the movie,-2
You don't believe that someone can actually you know believe in the priest and just wanted get married that badly in that church,-2
"And be you know believe everything in the priest, it's just kind of like, the movie's stressful",-2
I don't know if it's the acting or the way the characters are characterized,-1
"It's just really boring, bland film that even the plot it didn't really have anything going on for that",-2
"So (umm) For those who are interested, I definitely do not recommend this movie at all",-2
My review is on Ocean's Thirteen,0
I saw Ocean's Eleven and Ocean's Twelve and I really like those,2
"All of the movies have George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and so you know, they're nice to look at but Ocean's Eleven and Twelve were good",-2
Ocean's Thirteen not good at all,-1
I don't like it,2
I thought the other two were pretty exciting,-2
And (uhh) not a lot of people liked Ocean's Twelve but I still liked it,-3
"Ocean's Thirteen, not exciting at all",1
They had some complications that were pretty small and were resolved pretty quickly without any drama or anything,2
"It was just not exciting, at all",-2
"So if you're going to go see a movie, I would not recommend that",-1
"If you don't see it, you're not missing anything",-2
"I recently viewed the movie Click with Adam Sandler, and I was very disappointed",-2
"I expected more, I'd seen the previews and I thought it looked like a pretty good story",-1
"(umm) It's PG-thirteen, but in this day and age, PG-thirteen it's harder to tell what, what that really means, you know, well in this one there's lots of cussing, (umm) there's some bedroom scenes, even though they don't show any skin you obviously know what they're doing",-1
"(umm) There's (uhh) a dog that keeps (uhh) humping the stuffed animal, there's farting, I just I just (stutter) thought it was a rude movie",-2
I loved the storyline,2
"You know, I love the fact of what the story about, in fact in even made me cry in the end",1
But we could've done without all the other garbage that they added to this movie,-2
"(umm) I don't know why they do that to movies, and my husband was very leery of it too, because he said I've never seen an Adam Sandler movie that's actually been clean and (umm) and actually okay for children to watch",-2
"So I'm gonna give this a two just because you know, it could (stutter) it had so much potential, and they just like, trashed it up in my opinion",-2
"I just watched (uhh) this movie, Happily N'Ever After",0
I was looking very forward to seeing it when I had remembered seeing the previews for it,-1
I was very disappointed in it,-2
I think it could have been (umm) so much more,-1
"I mean there was a few funny parts and I expected more from you know, considering all the stars it has in it",-2
"It has Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddy Prince Jr",0
", Andy Dick, George Carlin and Sigourney Weaver just to name a few",1
"So I guess I just expected a few more, a a (stutter) better movie from these (umm) actors",-2
This is rated PG so you can watch this with your kids,-2
"However, I started watching it with my kids and they got so bored they got up and left, went outside to play",-2
"So I was left watching this by myself, and I went ahead and watched it all the way through to the end so I could do this review and I was hoping that it would get better in the end",-3
It didn't,-1
(umm) Very Disappointing,-2
Not much else I can say about it,0
(umm) Rent it if you must (umm) I would,1
I'm glad I didn't pay money to go see this at the movies,-2
"I would've really been upset had I paid (uhh) you know, seven eight bucks a ticket for us to go see this",1
"So anyway, if you don't have anything better to do, then you might watch this movie",-2
Hi,0
My name is Jordan and today I will be reviewing the movie Ratatouille,1
(uhh) First of all let's say that I had an incredible build up to this movie,3
"I saw the previews in theaters six months ago, (uhh) I looked at my friend and said look, we're seeing this",2
"(umm) I personally love Disney movies and I think that (umm) Disney Pixar, you know, the animations has just added a real, you know, incredible life-like (uhh) aspect to (umm) Disney movies which is especially true in Ratatouille which looks incredible",1
"(uhh) I know that (umm) in Finding Nemo they had, in fact, (uhh) made the scenes look too real so they had to, you know, kind of fake it down and I'm pretty sure they did the same thing in Ratatouille",2
"(umm) I cook a lot {laughter} and so I can appreciate, you know, a lot of the (uhh) a lot of the food references that are made",1
"(umm) I I (stutter) love the storyline, it's so incredible, it's like anyone can cook",2
"(umm) It's a story about a rat who decides to become a chef in Paris and how he goes about doing that but, really I I (stutter) love this movie",-1
I think I think (stutter) it's incredible,1
"(umm) I think that (uhh) a lot of the more recent videos from Disney such as The Emperor's New Groove, (umm) Over the Hedge, and stuff like that, they've had a lot of real high brow (umm) you know adult comedy but, I think Ratatouille does a very good job in (umm) sticking to it's target audience which is kids and you know, hyping that to how Disney movies used to be, you know, with with kids jokes and not these kinds of inane sexual references so I would highly recommend Ratatouille",2
I think it's a great movie that anyone should see,3
Okay,3
This is a review of John Lamaro's Land of the Dead,-1
Land of the Dead was (umm) and not as good as (uhh) the other Romero zombie movies,-1
(umm) Yes it continued the motif of having zombies represent either (uhh) some sort of disenfranchised group,-1
"(umm) Which was you know, and important and interesting but if you like overall it really is, wasn't that new of a plot going on here",-2
(umm) Felt pretty rehashed,-2
"As for the acting, the acting was pretty good (uhh) John Leguizamo was okay, better than I expected and (umm) Dennis Hopper was awesome as always",2
Hey there,1
"Summer here and if you're looking for a fantastic DVD at a value price that everyone in your family can watch, well why not try Pay It Forward, with Haley Joel Osment, Helen Hunt, and Kevin Spacey? This movie takes you through the journey of a child who learns life's lessons and it might just leave you crying in the end",3
Now I purchased this DVD for a little under ten dollars so it's a great value to add to your DVD collection,0
"But, word of caution",1
"The movie is PG thirteen for some mature thematic elements including substance abuse and recovery, some sexual situations, language, and brief violence",2
But let me tell you for your older kids you can learn a lesson from this like none other,3
According to the movie it's a simple story line,-1
"Haley Joel Osment has a teacher, Kevin Spacey, and a mom, Helen Hunt",0
The teacher gives him a lesson,2
Let's change the world,-1
And he does,0
The process of the movie takes you through how he changed the world and how it comes from his small town to change people's lives all the way across the country,-1
This movie truly teaches you that one person can make a difference,1
Participating in the Diversity Inclusion Initiative has been incredibly beneficial to me in my career in a number of ways.,2
"It gave me the opportunity to work on several projects at the University of North Texas, which has one of the largest music libraries in the world.",2
This helped give me the experience and qualifications I needed to make me competitive in the job market.,2
One of the projects that I was able to develop myself involved putting together a study of instructional practices in graduate institutions that offer music degrees from around the country.,2
This has provided valuable insight into curricular practice.,2
"Another was the creation of a finding aid for the Anna Harriet Heyer Collection, which developed a practical skill while making the world aware of yet another important resource housed at the University of North Texas.",1
The Diversity Inclusion Initiative also fully supported a trip to the National Conference of the Music Library Association where I made many connections with librarians and spoke with representatives of several search committees.,2
"Hi I'm Caroline, today I'd like to review The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen",0
"(uhh) I did not like this movie at all, I would not recommend it",-3
I only watched half of it because I didn't like the rest of the movie,-1
It is rated PG-thirteen,-1
(uhh) It is a mind-blowing adventure,-1
"It has Sean Connery in it, {laugh} which is probably the biggest name in here",0
"And little do you know that (uhh) the league extraordinary gentlemen has a woman in it and each of these (uhh) five people have different powers, and (uhh) they're all a little bit special at what they do, and (uhh) you've got a vampire in there, you've got an invisible man",1
And they just go out and try to save save (stutter) {sigh} I guess these European countries and save the world from going into another world war,0
"So (umm) (uhh) it's a little interesting, it says it has eye popping effects and amazing action and it is definitely an action, probably for the guys out there, but really strange",1
"Almost like a (umm) I don't know, really weird comic strip that you're gonna get",0
"Comic, you know one of those weird ones that they put out",0
"So (uhh) Sean Connery, the (stutter) League of Extraordinary Gentlemen",-1
"Movie review, I Know Who Killed Me",0
"(uhh) Nah, not very good",-1
One out of five at very most,0
"(umm) But it's a Lindsay Lohan movie, so (uhh) I don't know",-2
I didn't like it,-1
It was kind of (umm) more funny to me than it was scary,-1
I kind of took the whole thing as a joke,-2
"But (uhh) it's definitely in the vein of, like, I don't know, I'd I'd (stutter) say it's pretty similar, in some aspects, to a movie like (umm) maybe even, maybe Saw",-2
"It's almost (umm), I don't know, it's almost too similar, to the point of where you kind of know what's going to happen, kind of all all (stutter) those kind of movies kind of blend together",-1
"But, I mean, if you're going to watch a movie like that, go see Saw again or something, because this movie is really not good at all",-2
Seriously,-3
One out of five,-1
"So if you want to see it, you can do it",-1
But I wouldn't,-2
"So I Know Who Killed Me, one out of five",-2
"Hi, I'm Bruce and today (umm) I'm reviewing the DVD (uhh) widescreen edition of Premonition, (uhh) starring Sandra Bullock and Julian McMahon, and here's a closer look at it",1
"I don't have the box for it because I rented it (uhh) at (uhh) Red Box, one of their kiosks",1
And this is a psychological thriller,-1
"It's rated PG-thirteen, (uhh) and again starring Sandra Bullock and Julian McMahon and the (uhh) movie is about a woman who's forced to perpetually relive a terrible week in her life (uhh) where her husband is killed in a car crash",-2
(uhh) {clears throat} And so we keep seeing a lot of same events over and over again,1
"(uhh) What motivated me to (uhh) check out this movie was my wife, (uhh) really likes Sandra Bullock, so I got it primarily for her",0
"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend it",-1
It was (uhh) rather disappointing,0
(uhh) and (umm) It was very long,-2
It was two hours and twenty minutes,-3
"(uhh) But it, and that's a long movie to me",-1
"But it felt (uhh) at least like three hours and the fact that they kept rewinding the story where she keeps reliving the same week over and over, (uhh) it felt extremely long (uhh) and (uhh) it just really went on a long time",-1
Hi,0
"Today I'd like review Die Another Day, the James Bond movie starring Pierce Brosnan and Halle Berry",0
And this is one of the more recent James Bond movies but I found that it's just really silly overall,-2
"(umm) I mean it has some entertaining action sequences, some cool gadgets and cars and stuff, but overall it just feels tired and old and not that engaging",-2
(umm) The DVD however is quite good,1
"It's, this is the two disc ultimate edition DVD, part of the James Bond ultimate edition set, and (umm) has several features on the two discs it comes in",0
"(umm) Like audio commentary, (umm) lots of featurettes and documentaries, interactive things you can do",-1
"(uhh) Trailers, DVD-rom features, (umm) great audio and video quality so it's got a lot of features and it's generally a great DVD set but the movie's not really that good so I (stutter) don't think I'll recommend it",1
"Hey guys, my name is Emma and I'm here to talk to you about a movie I saw recently, Spider Man Three",0
"(umm) I gotta say I've seen the other two Spider Man movies and I wasn't really that impressed, you know",-2
"They're pretty entertaining I guess and I'm a fan of (uhh) Kirsten Dunst so I always like to watch movies that she's in but I didn't have high expectations for Spider Man Three because I didn't really like the first two, but it certainly did not exceed my incredibly low expectations",-2
"You know, it was probably worse than I thought it would be, actually",-2
"Granted I only paid two dollars to see it, (uhh) there's a really cheap movie theater where I live that I can go see movies that have come out (umm) recently for pretty cheap but two dollars didn't even really seem like a bargain considering that movie, you know? Just really cheesy (uhh) the graphics and stuff were just kind of annoying, like the CGI stuff",-2
"I don't know, I'm not really into that, and the action in it was really not that exciting",-3
"(umm) The acting also horrible, you know, I realize it's based on a comic book and that's kind of the style that they're in, you know, kind of over the top, kind of cheesy, but I don't know",-3
I feel like there's a lot of movies that have come out recently based on comic books that are way better than the Spider Man ones and it's just kind of a disappointment,-2
I think that they could have done a much better job on that movie,-2
"(umm) So in a scale from like one to five I think I'd give it like a two, honestly",-2
"Hi, this is my review of Jurassic Park Three",1
"(uhh) This is the third Jurassic Park, obviously, in the series and unlike the previous two it is not directed by Steven Spielberg",0
"He does executive produce, but it is (uhh) directed by Joe Johnston",-2
(umm) What I found most exciting about this movie when I first heard about that they were making a third is that it once again stars Sam Neill who was absent in the second movie,-2
(umm) Unfortunately (uhh) when I ended up seeing it I was pretty disappointed all around,-3
"(uhh) The second movie I didn't think was nearly as good as the first, which is one of my all-time favorite movies, but (uhh) the second still had some good aspects to it and it was overall a pretty enjoyable movie",-3
(uhh) The third one just feels completely (uhh) unneeded,-2
"It seems like we've seen all this before, (uhh) and seen it better",0
There's really not a whole lot original original (stutter) concept left in it,1
(uhh) the story's just kind of a rehash of the previous movie and it overall just feels very forced,-2
I don't think it was needed at all and I didn't really enjoy it,-1
I actually found it pretty hard to sit through,-2
So (uhh) I definitely will not recommend this movie,-2
I would say you could skip it entirely even if you were a fan of the previous movies,-2
(uhh) So unfortunately (uhh) a great series that really just lived on longer than I think it needed to,-2
"Hey guys, what's up? Right now I'm going to review the movie Live Free or Die Hard featuring Bruce Willis",1
"By far Live Free or Die Hard, or known as Die Hard Four, is probably my favorite as best movie in the Die Hard series",3
"Bruce Willis is your old, your (umm) your (stutter) old typical cop but basically this time he's fighting internet (umm) terrorists",-1
"Basically the terrorists have hacked into the FBI's like security measures and they're like taking over the world, or the United States at least",0
"And you know saving as always the cop goes in, save the days",2
But basically this movie it was more xxx than your average action movie,3
"The effects, like the shootout scenes, were amazing",3
They were done amazingly,3
When you're in the theater and you're watching them shootout each other you actually feel like you're there,2
The story it was actually done really well,2
It wasn't just your typical like you know terrorist then you know cop comes in and saves the day,0
There was like more plot to it than that,1
The action scenes were my favorite parts though,1
It's one of the best action blockbuster I've seen this whole summer and I highly recommend you guys seeing it,1
"Bruce Willis does his role perfectly, everything is done perfect",3
"The casting was really good, the effects were awesome",2
I definitely recommend you guys watching that movie,3
You (uhh) you won't be disappointed,1
So how do I write terms and conditions for my business as a small business owner?,0
Well firstly what you need to do is list all of the things that are important for your products and services.,0
"Get some examples from industry associations of the different terms and conditions that other people in your industry use, review them, look to see how your terms and conditions might fit into those, sit down and draft them, and then have somebody look at them like a solicitor or an industry representative to see that they meet all the compliances and state regulations.",1
Hi,0
This is Mama three for ExpoTV,0
"Today I would like to review the Disney DVD, The Fox and the Hound",1
"This film was originally released in nineteen eighty-one, it is rated G and it's eighty-three minutes long",0
"It follows the story of a hound dog named Copper and a fox cub named Todd and when they're young, they are friends but one winter, Copper goes away with his (umm) owner and he's taught to be an hound dog that hunts and when he comes back, he's suppose to be hunting Todd and that causes conflict in their relationship",1
"This is not one of my favorite movies, it doesn't seem to hold my kids attention either so no matter what the price of it is, it's not one, that I would recommend buying",-3
"It does have some special features on here, there is the trailer, there a (stutter) trivia game, there's a read along, which actually my kids actually enjoy better than the movie",1
"Hey there expotv, Summer here",0
Today we're reviewing the DVD Freedomland,0
Now Freedomland has Samuel L Jackson and Julianne Moore,0
It is rated R for some language and some violent content and it runs about two hours long,-1
Now I want to tell you this from the beginning,-2
I do not like this movie,-2
I don't see any sense in Freedomland ever being made,-3
"I understand that the movie was based on the bestselling novel, I understand that it was acted well, I understand that Julianne Moore totally was out of character by playing the person she played in this movie, but I didn't see the premise behind the movie",-3
"Now (stutter) the premise of course is is (stutter) basically a a (stutter) white woman living in the not so white section of the city, has her car stolen and her son is in the backseat supposedly and there is a frenzy",-2
The entire town is trying to find her son,-2
"They're looking and looking and looking, and she's got a history of using drugs, and she has a history of being a liar and not not (stutter) acting appropriately and then not being (stutter) you know a person with (uhh) everything there, all her marbles together in a row",-3
"And (uhh) that this (stutter) to me was very, very similar to some news event that had actually occurred",0
And then that's when it fell off for me,-1
When I'm watching a movie of something you know with with (stutter) actors of this caliber I expect to watch something that's new and unique and I didn't find that with this movie,0
So for me Freedomland was a total waste of time,-2
It was a total waste of money,-3
I hated the movie,-2
I don't think Samuel L Jackson should have been in it and I think that Julianna Moore lowered herself to play the person in this movie,0
I hated the events that unfolded and I hated the ending,-1
"Hi, ExpoTV",0
Today I'm reviewing (umm) Zoom Academy for Superheroes,1
It's actually based on a novel (umm),0
I think it's called Zoom's Academy for (stutter) Supergifted,-1
(umm) And I have to say that I was not overly impressed with this movie,0
(umm) It seemed to be a little bit boring (umm) getting through it,0
"(umm) There's a few decent stars in there where, I guess, maybe that's where my disappointment came from",0
"I thought, Oh, this is going to be funny and good",-1
"Tim Allen, Courteney Cox, and an old classic, Chevy Chase, in there",0
So (umm) the story is about (uhh) Tim Allen's character (umm) now has lost all his powers,0
He hasn't done any superhero work in a long time,0
So he's lost his powers,-1
"But something, you know, there's a villain and he's needed to help save the day",-2
"So he goes in and trains all these (umm) kids who have superpowers, and he's training them how to defeat, you know, the villains",-1
So that's what the storyline is about,2
But I didn't find it too exciting,0
(umm) I don't know,0
"{movie} Hey what's up Expo videos, I'm here to talk about Napoleon Dynamite",1
"{movie} Everybody, I'm mute it just to talk but everybody knows Napoleon Dynamite",0
It's like the new movie,1
It's like the the new teenage movie to watch,0
It's like a big hit,2
(uhh) Napoleon Dynamite is definitely a classic comedy of our age I guess you could say,0
"(umm) This is something that you'll be showing your kids just cause you know, (umm) maybe Sixteen Candles or like (umm) other movies like that (uhh) would be like a movie that your parents showed you or something",1
"But this is definitely something you're gonna show your kids cause it's hilarious, and it's hilarious in a different way and a lot of people don't (uhh) appreciate it as much as xxx it is because they just kinda think it's funny but I think this is creatively done because I'm into like a weird humor, I guess you could say, and there's like (umm) like hidden humor in here just that (uhh) with editing and continuity and (uhh) just the way things are produced that makes it humorous in that aspect as opposed to just (uhh) the way he is",2
And it's (stutters) intelligently made I think,1
"One of the best comedies out there of our age as opposed to like, those other comedies that are actually really stupid with just bad bad (stutter) jokes and what not",0
(uhh) Definitely something to check into,2
You can tell this is made by (uhh) film students,2
"(uhh) But it's really good, I really enjoy it",3
"In this lesson, you've learned a lot of concepts that we'll be applying in this course.",1
"Concepts about structuring data into tables, extracting data that we want, counting rows with aggregations and linking tables together using primary keys and joins.",1
,1
"1) Be ready early - We’ve heard from employers who call job seekers during their scheduled time, only to be met with a voice mail",2
,-3
"Maybe your clock is a few minutes fast, maybe they were running a little behind",1
"Whatever the case may be, treat this as you would for an in-person interview – be ready around 10 minutes early",1
This will ensure you won’t miss their call and will also give you some time before the interview starts to go over any final points you want to remember,1
"[BROLL] Interviewee is nicely dressed sitting at a table with a with pen, notepad, glass of water and phone",1
The Interviewee is reviewing his/her notes,2

We've created a simple spreadsheet Just like the one you're currently using but packed with all the great features you get in Modern CRM systems You can set reminders and appointments and sync them with your Google calendar,3
"I personally love the to-do list with my next tasks, and there's a lot more! The pricing is also great",2
"It was very important for us to make it affordable for small businesses, so while pricing starts at $29 per user It's easy to reduce the price to five dollars by sharing it with friends",2

Hey there we are talking about introductory speeches and we have just talked to the person that we are going to be introducing and we have got a real good sense of what it is that they want us to say.,1
Now either before you talk to that person or after you talk to that person it is very important that you find out every bit of information that you can about the speaker that you are introducing.,1
"Where are they from, where do they go to school, what was their life like growing up, what was their career like, what were the highs of their career, what were the lows of their career, do they have a family, do they like basketball, do they eat pizza with pepperonis?",-1
Good morning.,-1
This is my video review of The (uhh) Simpsons Movie,0
If you haven't seen this movie by now I don't really think you should,-2
It's been out in theaters quite awhile,-1
"I'm pretty sure they'll be taking it out soon and in my opinion, this is pretty much just a big let down",-2
There (stutter) wasn't that many funny parts in the movie and the only funny parts that there actually were I had already seen cause they were in the commercials,-2
"So if you own a TV and you saw the commercials, I wouldn't recommend seeing the movie, and even if you didn't see the commercials, I wouldn't really recommend the movie",-2
"I mean, I love the Simpsons and pretty much they're always funny",-2
"Some people don't like the current seasons, but I still think that they're pretty funny, and I was really let down by the movie",-2
So I mean the whole plot was kind of stupid,-1
They're trying to save Springfield,-3
"(stutter) I guess I didn't like the plot so once the plot got ruined, I really didn't care",-2
The movie seemed to kinda drag on for me and it wasn't even that long,-3
It was definitely a comedy and I guess if you're a true Simpsons fan you're gonna wanna see the movie,1
But you're probably just gonna end up wasting about six bucks,-2
"So if you're thinking about seeing it, I wouldn't recommend it",-2
"Maybe rent it, that's probably gonna be cheaper and if you rent it, I wouldn't really expect too much cause really you can see a lot funnier stuff in the show, and the shows are free",0
"Hi, this is Brian",1
I'd like to talk to you about a movie,0
It's called All of Me,1
It's actually kind of a short movie,0
It's only like ninety-one minutes long,-1
(umm) This is the Gold Reel Collection,0
"(umm), It's kind of a slow movie",1
"It does star Lily Tomlin, and Steve Martin",-2
"(umm) It's interesting that Steve Martin is an an (stutter) attorney or lawyer, but he wants to be a magician, and, (umm) Lily Tomlin, (umm) is a spinster and I don't want to give away too much of the plot but she ends up being inside of (umm) her spirit becomes inside of (umm) Steve Martin and that's where a lot of the interesting things in the movie come in",0
"(umm) It wasn't one of my favorite movies, but (umm) I'd probably give it a two but, two out of five stars but (umm), if you haven't seen the movie maybe you want to rent it before you you (stutter) purchase it but you can probably get it for ten dollars because it's been out for a little bit",2
"Again, this is All of Me",-1
Hello Expo Tv,0
(uhh) I'm here today to review the movie Michael Clayton currently in theaters,0
"(umm) If you're like most people including myself, you probably will not enjoy this movie because I most definitely did not",-2
(uhh) most people would call it a law thriller,0
"(uhh) Kind of like, John Grisham kind of books but Maybe more along the lines of like a two thousand page John Grisham book",-2
"(uhh) It's just, it's far too long",-2
"If you even look at the other Expo TV reviews about this movie, even the people that like the movie all seem to agree, the movie's way too long",0
"(uhh) The movie stars John Grisham, I mean {laughter} the movie stars George Clooney as Michael Clayton and (uhh) he actually, he does a pretty decent job and (uhh) anyways, Michael Clayton is (uhh) the fixer of the law firm, (uhh) takes care of all the messy messy (stutter) corporate cases",-1
"And also kind of complicating this is the fact that his personal life sort of unraveling with gambling and family problems and all sorts of things and basically he gets to the point where he just gets completely sick of fixing everyone's mistakes and it just kinda compounds and (uhh) I don't wanna ruin it for you, but",0
Hopefully you're not gonna see it anyway because it sucks,0
So (uhh) I give the movie two out of five stars,-2
George Clooney does alright,-2
"And I don't know, it makes you think a little bit but most of the time you're just thinking I wish I didn't watch this movie",1
So save your money and go see something else,-1
Until next time,-2
"Hello my name is Sarah and I will be doing my video opinion on the movie Shall We Dance? (uhh) starring Jennifer Lopez, Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon",1
"(umm) You know I really didn't enjoy this movie at all (uhh) it was, kinda boring for me, (umm) it kinda felt as if there were parts in there they just put in there to kinda pass the time on",-3
(umm) Basically the movie is about (umm) Richard Gere's character and him being a workaholic,0
(umm) He's looking for some some (stutter) extra sizzle to add into his life and he meets up with a dance instructor who is played by Jennifer Lopez and basically she convinces him to sign up for some ballroom lessons,0
"He gets into it, he enjoys it a lot but he's still keeping a secret from his family so he is trying to cope with having this this (stutter) you know, exciting moment added to his life and trying to keep it from his family so he's trying to figure out how to balance everything and you know I mean the dance scenes in here I felt were fantastic I thought Jennifer Lopez did a fantastic job and the girl really can dance (umm) as as (stutter) far as that goes, that's pretty much it",1
"I think the movie was horrible, it was kinda boring but (uhh) if you like to see some dancing, then hey pick it up if not",-3
"Hi, my name is Mike, and this is my review for Mr",1
Magorium's Wonder Emporium and (uhh) this was a film that we took our two year old to (uhh) just a couple days ago,0
(umm) It's probably one of the worst films (uhh) I've seen probably in the last five or six years,-2
(umm) The main reason why was there wasn't much of a plot but it was pretty boring,0
"(uhh) Not, not (stutter) really a lot of interesting things (uhh) seemed to occur during the (uhh) during the show",-3
"(umm) One of the things that was (uhh) kind of interesting is it seems to be a cross between Willy Wonka and (uhh) and some other Christmas style movies (uhh) in which they're just hoping to kind of show you some (uhh) interesting, colorful scenery (uhh) and have a toy store in which you walk by things and things pop out and weird stuff happens",0
"But (uhh) that just after maybe a minute or two of that and it becomes, you become used to it, you're just really not interested in seeing any more of that",-2
(uhh) Dustin Hoffman (uhh) is kind of bizarre (uhh) cast as this (uhh) particular person and Natalie Portman seems to just be sleepwalking through the role,-2
(uhh) (stutter) Everybody involved in this movie (uhh) seems to just be cashing a paycheck,-2
"It's a horrible, terrible film and so I I (stutter) can't (uhh) recommend it whatsoever",1
So definitely pass on Mr,-2
Magorium's Wonder Emporium,-1
(uhh) Save your money and rent (uhh) the classic Willy Wonka and you'll enjoy (uhh) the experience a whole lot better,-2
"And my name is Mike, that's been my movie review",-3
"Hi, my name is Anaj, and today I'm reviewing the movie Saawariya which is currently running in theaters (uhh) nationwide",1
"Now Saawariya is an Indian movie, it's actually a Bollywood production and the (uhh) nowadays (uhh) some Indian movies do show up in the US theaters",0
(umm) Now about Saawariya,-3
I do not have good words for this movie,0
(uhh) I think it's like one of the worst movies I've ever seen,-2
"(uhh) Well the the (stutter) thing is that it stars this new guy who's son of the old heroes so it's kind of his (stutter) launch in, you know, home production",-3
"So it's (uhh) the story goes like, you know, there's (uhh) this new singer dancer at a bar which is in the call girl area or the red light area kind of thing and he falls in love with this girl, but this girl is in love with some other person so, you know, the story is whether he'll actually get the girl or not and, you know, how he pursues that",0
(umm) The only good thing about this movie are the songs and the dances,0
So if you're a fan of Indian songs and the dances that go along with it you may want to watch this movie but otherwise I'll just rate this movie one out of five,-1
"(uhh) Was bad, bad (stutter) part of New York actually, you know, going to the movies",-2
I just lost three hours of my time for nothing,-3
"Hello, my name is Sara and I will be doing my video opinion on the classic Elf, (umm) starring the wonderful comedian Will Ferrell",2
"(uhh) This movie's basically about a child who was found in a convent and snuck into Santa Claus's bag, was taken back to the North Pole and had (uhh) been raised by elves",0
So basically he lived his whole life you know (umm) thinking he was an elf,1
Of course he was the tallest kid,0
"Like he couldn't fit in the seats, you know he always outgrew all the other elves so he always had wondered you know, why was he so different",2
So he finds out that he (umm) has a dad somewhere else (uhh) and he travels to New York City,0
(umm) This movie is is (stutter) definitely hilarious,2
"(umm) It goes through the you know, different things that he had experienced being in New York",2
"(umm) Experiencing you know, a whole new life change",0
"(umm) Which I thought was you know, really cool",0
He's going through all these different things,0
He decides to work at a toy store,0
"(umm) This is just really cool and this, what I like about this DVD is that it gives you an option",2
"It gives you two discs, (umm) which one is for widescreen and one is for full screen",0
"Which is great I think (umm) you know, someone who really doesn't, I don't really like widescreen so I'm great that it gives me an option",1
So again I really think you should pick it up,2
interested in this opportunity and passionate about the industry that he wants to be able to join,3
Therefore he can add value and be a great fit for this organization,2
Now you want to make sure that you practice practice practice,1
"This is your first impression to the interviewer, so you don't want to lose their attention in order to really knock it out of the park, you want to plan and rehearse",1
It is almost guaranteed that you're going to get a question similar to this one so you want to make sure that you're selling what the interviewer is buying,1
Think about what they'll be interested in by really understanding the job description and the traits that they're looking for in the job description,2
"Hi, my name is Anaj and today I'm reviewing the movie Lions for Lambs which is currently playing in theaters nationwide",0
Now Lions for Lambs has a great star cast,3
"It stars Robert Redford, Tom Cruise, Meryl (stutter) Streep, and you know that's about it, that's the only good thing about the movie, there's nothing else that is good about this movie and I'll tell you why",-2
"So (stutter) so Tom cruise is a senator and (uhh) Meryl Streep is a (uhh) reporter from one of the newspapers or magazine or TV that I'm not very sure, but she's, she's (stutter) a reporter",-3
So one of the scenes is going on in Tom Cruise's office where the reporter and Tom Cruise are talking to each other,-2
"The other scene is back in Afghanistan and there's a platoon of, you know, the army, the marines who are kind of fighting, and the third is actually a philosophy professor who's talking to his student in his office",-2
"And (stutter) all the three of the, you know, all the three scenes are kind of related to each other because they're talking about why did the US go to war with Afghanistan and Iraq and what was the reason and what can be done now? And (stutter) you know whatever they talk about it's, they try to make a (stutter) drama out of it, a dramatic movie out of it, but really doesn't make sense, you know",-3
"(stutter) Everyone that I've talked to, I saw the movie I hated it",-2
Everyone I talks to said that it did not make any sense,-3
"You know with all these star casts, these (stutter) star collectors in there, you know, that you go watch Tom Cruise in theaters (uhh) you know he hasn't been in theaters for a while now",-2
"And you see go watch his new movie and it's it's (stutter), you know, crap",-3
"It's it's (stutter) not at all good, I'm sorry for the words but that's what the movie is",0
And (uhh) I rate this movie one out of five,0
"If I had a chance of putting it zero, so you know, it's D",0
"If I get a chance of F I'll give a F, I'll give it a zero",-2
But anyways I'll give it a one,-2
"Do not go in theaters to watch this movie, this (uhh) movie's no good",-3
I mean only if you have an additional two hours in your life that you have nothing to do go watch that movie,0
"Hey guys, today we've got Men In Black Two which is the sequel to the first Men In Black based on the (uhh) I believe it was a Dark Horse comic starring Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones",0
And in the back we're playing just the opening scene when when (stutter) Will Smith is riding this giant worm creature through the tunnels so he can rescue the innocent citizens of New York,0
"And (uhh) this movie I thought was a very inferior sequel, it was good it had some good moments, some good elements to it",1
(uhh) Some of the comedy was good there was still a decent chemistry between (uhh) Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones,2
"(uhh) Rosario Dawson shows up for her first blockbuster appearance (umm) later on she went to star in a lot of movies by Edward Burns and in Sin City and some other movies, Alexander",0
"And (umm) well overall the movie just wasn't as good, the props were just as interesting the design was just as (uhh) good",-1
The effects were (stutter) not quite as good I thought they could have been a bit better given the fact that it was a few years later and that (uhh) you know ILM standards are continually evolving,-1
"It just wasn't as funny, wasn't as entertaining",-2
I have to give it two stars out of five,-2
Hi guys it is coach Jim again,0
I talk to you about another movie I recently watched with my son,0
It was (uhh) Fred Claus,-3
Now Fred Claus is a show,-2
Well if you've seen the previews you've seen the best parts of the movie,0
"(umm) It wasn't my favorite, I actually thought the plot stunk",0
The acting was horrible,-2
"(umm) It's not one of my favorites that I've I've (stutter) watched, it was actually one of the worst ones I've seen in a long time",-2
"(umm) Just, it (stutter) oh my gosh it's so (stutter) my eleven year old son did, about halfway through he was ready to go home",-3
"Okay, oh me, we've seen this plot millions and millions of times, you know blah blah blah, everybody knows you can pretty much tell what the whole movie's about just from the commercials",-2
(umm) Not my favorite show and I do not recommend it for anybody it was just retarded,-2
"(umm) It has, it it (stutter) makes no sense it kind of shift around a little bit",-2
"Hi, today I am reviewing the DVD movie, Scary Movie",0
"(umm) It says on the box, it's hilarious and outrageous",0
I really didn't find it that funny,-2
"I think it's geared more toward (umm) the younger teenage, preteen audience even though it's definitely not appropriate for them",-2
This movie takes (umm) horror movies and makes spoofs on them so it's actually a comedy movie,-1
"As you can see, it's playing here in the background (umm) it features mostly high school kids so (umm) hence the audience is geared towards",0
I (umm) like I said definitely do not waste your eighty-eight minutes (umm) xxx (umm) watching this,0
(umm) There are much better movies out there,-3
"If you're looking for comedy, then {laughter} rent or buy a comedy and if you're looking for something that's going to scare you, then I would definitely just rent or buy a horror movie because this movie just didn't do it for me",-2
The acting is bad,-2
(umm) The writing is bad and (umm) it just looks like a low budget film to me,-1
Hi Expo TV,1
This is Rachel,1
Today I'm going to be reviewing the movie Crossroads,0
If you think Britney Spears is bad now you haven't seen this movie,1
It's awful,0
It's about three girls in high school,1
(umm) they're getting ready to graduate and go their separate ways,1
They were best friends when they were younger and now they've gone their separate ways and they've come back together and they're going on a road trip,-2
(umm) Awful awful acting,0
"Obviously starring Britney Spears, (umm) Taryn Manning and Zoe Saldana",-2
Also has Dan Akroyd and Kim Catrell in it,-3
"(umm) It does have a lot of special features, if you like Britney Spears it's got some music videos",1
"(umm) Two of em, for ""Overprotective"" and ""I'm Not A Girl, I'm Not Yet A Woman""",1
"(umm) Seven deleted scenes, a sing along with Britney, a karaoke version of some of her songs",1
(umm) A Crossroads through photo gallery,-3
Lots of special features but an awful movie,1
Hi,1
Today on ExpoTv I'm going to be reviewing (umm) a new movie that is a French movie and it's called Smiley Face,0
"And Smiley face is (umm) kind of the same (uhh) genre of movies as (umm) you know the Cheech and Chong movies, and (uhh) Half Baked, Grandma's Boy, that kind of like stoner movie",0
And but this one is just not even really that funny and really even that good at all,-2
"(umm) Basically (uhh) the plot of the movie is this (umm) (uhh) pothead named Jane eats (umm) these these (stutter) (umm) (uhh) treats that are, that have THC in them and she doesn't know that she does it and it just follows her day and her hilarious, supposed to be hilarious, misadventures and mishaps",-2
"But (umm) it's not funny (umm) it's really really just a bad movie and (uhh) if you want to see a good stoner movie see Half Baked, it's really funny",-2
Or Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle,-2
"Don't see this one, just skip it",-1
"It's not worth your money, and (umm) just don't go to see it",-3
"What's up, Expo? This is Seth again",1
I'm going to be reviewing the DVD three thousand Miles to Graceland,1
This stars Kurt Russell and (umm) (uhh) Kevin Costner,0
And what it is about (umm) two guys that are teamed up to (umm) go make a daring (umm) robbery of a casino in Las Vegas,1
And the twist is that it's during an Elvis (umm) (uhh) conference,-2
And everybody is dressed up as Elvis,-2
And so (umm) that's exactly what they do,-1
That's what (umm) the whole Graceland part is about,0
"It's (uhh) so they do, they attempt this daring robbery and then there's some twists and there's some turns",1
(umm) It is rated R for some strong violence (uhh) during the robbery,-1
I'm going to show you a clip here,0
,1
,1
974} It's an okay movie,1
I'd probably only give it a two out of five stars,1
(umm) It's not the greatest movie,0
But two out of five stars,1
(umm) You might enjoy it one time,0
"(umm) If you're an Elvis fan, you like seeing a bunch of guys dressed up as Elvis, you might like it even more than I do",1
Hey this is Dan with a review of The Simpsons the Movie,1
"(umm) I have been an avid fan of The Simpsons most of my life, and (uhh) was quite disappointed that the movie wasn't anything more spectacular than in an overblown episode per se",-2
(umm) The Simpsons the Movie basically (umm) (uhh) it serves on the premise of (umm) basically the entire town (umm) being at the verge of a toxic waste dump and ready to be quarantined,1
"(umm) When things happen that makes it such, (umm) the national government steps in and tries to seal it off in a bubble of sorts",1
"(umm) The premise isn't anything too far fetched out of a wacky Simpsons episode, and the postmodern (uhh) references within it to (uhh) movies like Titanic and (umm) other references or nothing more than something you might expect from a halloween special to The Shining or something like that",1
"So there was nothing too novel about it, I didn't find it particularly funny, particularly interesting and definitely not worth a ticket price (umm) let alone probably wanting to purchase this movie unless you get it at a really good deal",-2
"(uhh) It is a overblown episode, would not highly recommend it out of five, (uhh) out of four stars I would probably give this two",-2
(uhh) Out of five it's definitely two,-1
But The Simpsons The Movie not worthwhile in my book,-2
"It has cooler animation stressing more three D at the perspectives but nothing too revolutionary, so with that, The Simpsons the Movie, (umm) not something I'd really keep in my collection unless you can get it for a pretty good deal despite the donuts",-1
Hi,0
"I am Chris and this is a review of the DVD, The Last Castle starring Robert Redford and James Gandolfini",1
"(umm) In this movie, Robert Redford plays a (umm) military general sent to (umm) prison for a crime, sort of a technicality of a crime (umm) but he is sent to a military prison and the warden of the prison is James Gandolfini, best known for his role in the sopranos",-1
"And once there, Robert Redford finds that the prison is hopelessly corrupt and some of the inmates are being murdered and (uhh) James Gandolfini's character, the warden, (uhh) is running the prison (uhh) like a despot and (uhh) there's just a whole bunch of bad things going on inside the prison that shouldn't be happening",-2
(uhh) Robert Redford decides to do something about it and takes command and runs the military prison as sort of a military camp,1
"(umm) This movie starts out okay but quickly devolves, (umm) it doesn't end up being very good",-2
I am not exactly sure (uhh) what Robert Redford is doing in this movie,-2
"(umm) I feel maybe he lost a bet (umm) towards the end of this movie, it just becomes (uhh) silly",0
The ending was a little bit surprising but by then I I (stutter) really didn't care anymore,0
"(umm) This movie, it doesn't turn out to be as good as it starts out",1
It's a fairly (uhh) promising premise at the beginning but the (uhh) execution was just poor and it can't make up it's mind if it's (uhh) a prison story or a action movie or (uhh) exactly or military inquest (uhh) type of a conspiracy movie,-2
"It just can't make up it's mind what it is and falls apart in every level and (umm) by the end, you're just not interested anymore",-2
"(uhh) As far as the DVD itself goes, special features (umm) on this includes pretty standard theatrical trailer, production notes, deleted scenes, commentary and (uhh) a little HBO movie called (uhh) Inside The Castle Walls about military prisons and things like that",-2
"Really (umm) it's not, it's not worth your time",-2
"(umm) Maybe if it's on TV, you might watch it then, but really, I wouldn't bother with The Last Castle on DVD",-2
Hi here with me today I have the DVD called The Ghost and the Darkness,0
It has Michael Douglas and Val Kilmer in it,0
"(umm) I don't think is one of the best movies (uhh) ever it's about (umm) is about (uhh) two guys who go to Africa because they've been called upon because (uhh) a village over there in East Africa, this is set in 1996, has a problem because there's two man-eating lion, lions (stutter) who are (uhh) killing a lot of the people there",-3
So these people are commissioned to hunt the animals,-3
"So they have a lot of problems (umm) during that time and they set up traps which the lions (umm) actually (uhh) outsmart them with, so it's actually kind of interesting",0
"But it's a very drawn out long movie, (umm) not really interesting the ending's pretty lame and kind of flops in the end",2
(umm) Which is why I guess this movie this movie (stutter) didn't really (uhh) hit big or anything,-2
"But (uhh) (uhh) this is (uhh) I wouldn't, it's not really a action movie I'd classify more as like a, it's like a story",-1
(umm) And then you don't feel sympathetic for anybody in this movie,0
"(uhh) Not the lions, not the people, not the hunters or the (umm) village people so there's nobody really to side with in here",-1
"(umm) It's, it (stutter), I wouldn't suggest this, it's (uhh) not a, not a very great movie, not all very well put together",-1
"This is Fantastic Four, the first one",0
It's playing here in the screen,0
"What can I say about this? It stars Jessica Alba and though she may be pretty, she's not the best actress",-3
The movie is just really not that great,-3
(uhh) The acting in it is mediocre,-2
The special effects in it is the same and so is the script and story,1
All of it's mediocre,-3
The direction was was (stutter) horrible,-2
I was completely unsatisfied by this movie,-3
(umm) There's not much else to say besides that,-2
But the story was so bad that I actually considered leaving halfway through the movie,-2
"So, don't go out there and get this movie please, because it's really not worth it",-3
"If you wanna see a good superhero, if you wanna see a good superhero movie, go see any of the Spider-Mans, go see any of the go see Batman Begins, that's a good one, or go see any of the X-Men",-2
Those are all great movies,-2
This movie just jumped on the superhero bandwagon and just did not do a good job at retelling the true story of the Fantastic Four group,-1
It just didn't do it any honor,-3
I would be ashamed to have made this film if I was a director,-2
So I don't suggest you go out there to watch it and waste your money on this DVD,0
This is the Nicholas Cage film Windtalkers directed by John Woo,0
"Here's a clip, clip playing on the television screen",0
"(umm), I'm going to have to say do not get this movie",-1
Do not go out there and watch it,1
It's just no good,-1
Usually I'm a big Nicholas Cage fan but this time he completely missed his mark,-2
But I feel like it was John Woo to blame,-2
John Woo does martial arts,-2
He does not do war films,-3
And martial arts really like to emphasize dramatic scenes every single second,-2
"You know what I mean, like throwing a, throwing a (stutter) suitcase across the grounds very dramatic",-2
Running across the room is very dramatic when everyone is shooting at you,-2
"But, war movies are supposed to be as a whole dramatic",-3
But he tries to make every single little tidbit of it very dramatic and very it becomes very awkward,-3
"Nicholas Cage does his best, but he can't just pull it off",0
"(umm) There's a scene where they mix actual real life cannon firing video with filmed video, and it's just very awkward to watch",1
I didn't enjoy it at all,-2
The musical score was no good,-2
A lot of the movie is just more awkward than it is entertaining,-3
So I don't suggest going out there and finding Windtalkers,-2
"Save yourself the money, get yourself another Nicholas Cage movie",0
"I don't know, like Face-Off",0
"That's a good John Woo, Nicholas Cage movie",1
"Hi Expo TV, this is Melissa and you can check out my reviews at PM three two one to see (uhh), what I've been reviewing lately",1
"I'm reviewing for you today, The Matrix, featuring Keanu Reeves and Lawrence Fish, Fishburn (stutter)",1
"Basically, this movie, changed (umm), the way movies are made now",3
"(uhh), they just came out with these innovative new ways to film that just changed the whole film industry, and a lot of movies have started to film like the way they did The Matrix",2
"(umm) There's some good special features on this (uhh), DVD",1
"You have behind-the-scenes documentaries, cast and crew commentary, music only audio track, follow the white rabbit and take the red pills for more mysteries, mind bending extras",2
"(umm) We also have interactive menus, filmographies, (uhh) scene access, English subtitles, and more",2
"(umm) basically this is what it says on the back here and (uhh), I was trying to think of a way to describe this movie because it's just so complex, and the way they put it on the back just (umm), it's the right way to say it",1
"(umm), Our perception is our day in and day out world is real",0
"And the reality is the world is a hoax and elaborate (stutter) decept, (uhh) deception spun by an all power, spun by all powerful machines of artificial intelligence that control us",1
"(umm) This, movie really makes you think, what if there is more to what our world really is, and it's just a fabulous movie if you haven't seen it you definitely have to watch it",0
"I give it a five out of five, and it's something you need to check out",0
"Hello, I'm reviewing the movie The Missing starring Tommy Lee Jones and Cate Blanchett",1
(uhh) This is another Ron Howard film,1
"(umm) It's supposes, supposed (stutter) to be a suspense movie",-2
(umm) Essentially what happens is (uhh) Cate Blanchett (uhh) is living on the prairie and (uhh) someone or something comes in and captures her daughter,-2
Kidnaps one of the two girls and takes off with her and Tommy Lee Jones is actually Cate Blanchett's father,-2
He shows up (uhh) to help find the girl,-3
He's an indian tracker (umm) so he has the ability (uhh) to help find the girl,0
(umm) I gotta say I honestly didn't get this one,0
I didn't think Tommy Lee Jones (uhh) pulled off this role at all,-1
"(uhh) Thought Cate Blanchett did a great, did a good job",2
(uhh) But nothing really great,-2
(uhh) Didn't get it,0
Didn't understand it,1
As far as it being a Ron Howard film I was actually fairly disappointed,-1
(uhh) This particular version actually comes with the first disc which has the movie on it and then you have the second disc that has a whole lot of (uhh) bonus features,1
Actually (umm) three alternate endings,1
Maybe if they would've picked another one it would've been been better,-2
(uhh) Eleven deleted scenes and eleven behind the scenes featurettes (umm) and a lot of other stuff as well,-1
"So I would not recommend this one, (uhh) even with all the bonus footage",2
Hi this is Dan with my review of The Namesake available on DVD,1
This movie tracks the story of two generations of Indian Americans that (uhh) basically believe their homeland to come to America,0
(umm) The father and mother have two (umm) children a son and a daughter here in America and they try to identify basically who they are and how they fit in in this culture,0
The (uhh) generation divide and also with cultural issues are illustrated in this movie,1
And (umm) unfortunately this serious theme drags on for quite a long time,-2
"And (uhh) unless you have great interest in this subject, I frankly lost a bit of interest rather quickly so (uhh) it wasn't the best movie to me",-2
"In my opinion I, I (stutter) only give it two out of five stars",-1
The Namesake does tackle a serious topic and (umm) it does a good job portraying life although kind of depressingly as our main character (umm) struggles in life to find out who he is and how he fits in,2
The Namesake (umm) is rated PG-thirteen and (umm) generally pretty benign of a movie (uhh) so available on DVD,-1
(uhh) I again recommend it with two of five stars,0
"Hi, this is Jack and I'm reviewing the new movie out (umm) The Good Shepherd, (umm) starring Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, William Hurt, Alec Baldwin, Robert De Niro, so I mean, obviously you can tell it's got an all-star cast",0
"But unfortunately, I don't think an all-star cast really makes up or really makes the film",-2
"(umm) This is for, this is (stutter) Robert De Niro's return to directing for since the last thirteen years",-2
I really really wish he could have done a better job,-2
"(umm) I mean the story involved with the CIA part of it, with Matt Damon you know in the CIA, it's it's (stutter) interesting, but sometimes it seems kind of stretched out",-1
"And there are parts of it that are boring, but the really bad part about the movie is all these things all these parts having to do with his family",-2
I mean I understand that's kind of an important part of a movie but it made up about a third of the movie and I really wanted to sleep through all of it,0
(stutter) The movie is almost three hours long,-2
So I mean it's a really really long movie,-2
I was bored through most of it,0
I mean I was really really disappointed,-1
"With an all-star cast like this, apparently good director, you know and excellent story, you'd think they'd be able to do it but I don't think it was worth it",-2
"Hi, I'm here to review In the Name of the King",1
It's a film currently in theaters,0
(uhh) It's based on the xxx series of video games,-2
This one was horrible,-1
I'm giving it a one out of five,-1
(uhh) It takes place in medieval times and it's about an ongoing war between (umm) I don't even know,-3
"{laughter} This movie had horrible plot, horrible acting, horrible dialogue, horrible special effects, horrible action",-3
There was no saving grace for this film,-3
"It starred Jason Statham so I thought it would be good cause he tends to be in pretty good movies but no, this was a let down",0
"(umm) It's directed by Uwe Boll who is known for making pretty bad movies however this film see (uhh) most of his films are bad enough that they're funny, you can laugh at them",0
This one doesn't even offer that it's just boring more than anything,-3
(uhh) It tries to be Lord of the Rings,-2
"It has a many of orge like creatures, a wizard, a medieval time setting",0
Basically stole everything out of Lord of the Rings but made a million times worse,-3
(umhh) It's just everyone stay away from this film,-2
It was a horrible movie,-2
(umm) So yea that's In the Name of the King in a nutshell,-3
"Hi, I'm Chris, and this is a review of the DVD of the movie Constantine starring Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weiss",1
(umm) In this movie Keanu Reeves plays a sort of (umm) exorcist kind of a character where he performs exorcisms and he is (uhh) in touch with the demon world,0
"(umm) His character is John Constantine, hence the title, and this is based on a series of (uhh) graphic novels and he he (stutter) can see demons and he can see (umm) otherworld spirits and he basically fights them",-1
"He has (uhh) some fairly strange weapons that he uses this, that he uses to do this",-3
(umm) Holy water and a shotgun made out of a crucifix,-2
It's a fairly strange movie,-2
(umm) I know it's based on a graphic novel and those movies can tend to (uhh) run on the strange side,-3
"(uhh) This movie's a little stranger than most, it really was very odd",-1
(umm) If you're into this kind of stuff I guess it was okay,-2
"There's a big sort of (uhh) conspiracy to unleash a bunch of demons from hell and (umm) Keanu Reeves is trying to stop this and (umm) Rachel Weiss plays a cop who sort of reluctantly agrees to help him, basically reluctantly because she doesn't really believe him and he has an assistant who (uhh) the assistant has some pretty funny parts",-1
"He's not bad but (umm), I don't know",-2
This movie just didn't do it for me,0
(umm) I really didn't enjoy it,1
I I (stutter) slogged my way through it but it it (stutter) really wasn't that interesting,-1
"(umm) I really wouldn't recommend this, I've seen this sort of (uhh) theme done better",0
(umm) As far as the DVD goes there are eighteen minutes of additional footage which usually (umm) these scenes are cut out of the movie for a pretty good reason,-1
They really don't add anything to the movie,-1
"There's an alternate ending which isn't any better or any worse than the original ending, then there's you know theatrical content, (uhh) theatrical trailer and different languages and stuff like that",-1
(umm) Maybe rent this but I definitely wouldn't buy it,0
So that's the DVD of the movie Constantine starring Keanu Reeves,1
Hi expo,1
This is my review on the movie The Ladykillers,1
(umm) I'm a big Tom Hanks fan but I really wasn't all that impressed with this movie,-2
It seemed like there was a lot of drag time in this movie,1
(umm) Yeah there were (stutter) some funny scenes but (uhh) very few,-2
And (umm) for a Tom Hanks movie I was really let down,-2
"(umm) However that is my opinion and (umm) it's rated R for language, crude scenes, (uhh) some violence and (umm) it's a hundred and four minutes long",-2
There's several different actors in this movie,-2
"(umm) And however, you know, (stutter) it's just not as great as I expected it to be",0
And again I think this is another movie where my expectations were a lot higher than they should have been,1
So (umm) I'd probably give this one a two and if you wanna check it out (umm) you might like it better than I did,-1
That's The Ladykillers,-1
"Hello, I'm doing a movie review of the movie Eragon",1
It is in theaters almost everywhere,0
"Now I'm a fan of Harry Potter, I've seen all the Harry Potter movies",-2
I also have seen all of the Lord of the Rings movies,0
Now the Lord of the Rings movies got a little long for me,-2
Though they were still good,-1
I found Eragon's plot to be a little thin,-1
"And actually, while I was at Eragon I wanted to be Eragone out of the theater and away from that movie",1
Because I found it boring,-2
"It wanted me to go to, go to (stutter) sleep to be honest",0
{noise} So I (uhh) tried to struggle through it,-3
I went to get some popcorn,-1
"Ate it, wondered if I'd like the movie if I were eating and not paying full attention to it but I didn't really like it any more",1
It's probably a movie for younger boys,0
Younger boys who can't quite grasp a full plot,-1
It's for younger boys who maybe have read the book too because then they'll like seeing everything they read in the book come to life,-1
One thing I found cheesy and awkward about the movie was how the dragon and the main boy Eragon talked with their minds,-2
Let me do an impression of them,-1
That is what they looked like when they talked and it was awful,-2
Hard to watch,-2
But maybe the younger kids would like it,-2
So if you're a younger kid then maybe watch it,-2
"Alright Expo TV, this is my video review of the movie Sweeney Todd",1
"(umm) This movie, when I saw it, this movie looked sweet",2
"I mean it had everything, it looked I mean it was about this serial killer like barber guy and it had Johnny Depp and he was dressed up looking all sweet and so I was like yes I'm gonna go see this movie",0
"I obviously did not do enough research before I saw the movie, which you are a good person if you're watching this video because you're trying to do some research before you go out there and spend the (umm) looks like six fifty on the movie",-2
(uhh) This movie is a musical,-3
"So, if you don't like musicals, don't go see this movie",-3
"As soon as they started singing, I was just like, what did I get myself into, you know? I mean, I couldn't, I could not (stutter) get past that",2
"So, if you can get past the fact that there's Johnny Depp singing in this movie, (uhh) more power to you I guess",-1
You're gonna enjoy this one,0
I did not,-1
It has the same director as the guy from Nightmare Before Christmas,-3
"Figured this was gonna sweet movie, I didn't think he'd, well I mean I really wasn't probably thinking at all, because if you think about it, The Nightmare Before Christmas is sort of like a musical",-2
"So, I don't know, I made a bad choice with this movie",-3
"I don't think it's fair of me to give it a one out of five, but that's what I'm gonna give it",-2
Hello,1
I like to tell you about a movie I saw recently,2
It's Beowulf starring Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich,0
"This movie could have been really great if they had taken into the direction of three-hundred or possibly Lord of the Rings, they didn't do that",-1
(umm) The premise of the story (uhh) first of all this is a poem or a story written by an unknown character as it's the first ever written that we have found (uhh) besides Homers,2
(umm) It's (uhh) a great story really about a lifestyle of people,-1
(umm) Beowulf is a good guy,-1
"Grendel is a really bad guy, he's a monster",-2
Beowulf and the community around him have to protect themselves from Grendel,-1
"(umm) Actually I this in college a very long time, for so long that you began to hate it but, then I look back and I kind of understand why it was important to learn about it",1
Actually I think Grendel was basically another group of people that were trying to take over another society,0
The monster possibly were wearing these huge face masks so this movie didn't portray it like that,-1
They actually had Grendel as some really ugly monster and Angelina Jolie as a gorgeous mother who would make Grendel look like a sweet heart because she was so evil,0
"So of her good looks because they didn't try to, you know, make her look evil, they just had her made her look like (stutter) Angelina Jolie with extra gloss",2
"I mean, we don't need that, she has lips we know we see them she doesn't need that",2
So (umm) I am disappointed in the way it was presented,-1
"It is an epic tale, it's a good story, it's a great history about people, (umm) animation of the the (stutter) new age (uhh) type deal was terrible, and like I said she didn't fit the character",1
John Malkovich was okay he didn't help though,1
"Hi, I'm reviewing the movie Rocky Balboa, which is currently in theaters",1
It is the sixth edition in the Rocky series,0
"(umm) It's it's (stutter) gotten great reviews around but, to tell you the truth, I thought they should have stopped at Rocky one",1
(umm) I just thought this was too much,-1
"Sylvester Stallone was a great actor but he's now pushing sixty and having him in this role, you know, same old thing, you know",-1
"He goes out, we all know he's gonna fight, he's gonna win",1
"So, it was a, it's a typical Rocky movie but I see where it got some good reviews but I'm pretty much a little tired of the whole Rocky scene",1
"So if you weren't liking Rockys three, four, five, then trust me, you do not want to see this movie",-2
Don't waste your money,0
(uhh) I don't know how some people loved it,-3
You know the acting was okay,-2
You all know it's the same thing over and over that happens with Rocky movies,-1
"If they would have stopped Rocky one, I think it would have been great but, you know",-1
"(uhh) (uhh) You know, scene wise, there are a couple of good scenes in it",-1
"So if you're a Rocky, I guess if you're a die hard Rocky fan, this is a great movie",-2
"But as I said before, if you if you (stutter) haven't been feeling the other Rocky movies as of late, I wouldn't waste my time seeing this",-3
I saw it because it was a friend of mine recommended it,-2
But (ehh) it was a waste of time so keep that in mind before you go and waste ten dollars on this overrated and highly dragged out movie,-1
"What I have up for review here is the New Line platinum series widescreen edition of The Wedding Crashers, starring Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson and Christopher Walken",1
And this one is actually the uncorked edition,0
"Longer, wilder and funnier",0
(uhh) The movie takes place during a wedding party (uhh) initially,2
(uhh) The two characters actually play wedding crasher where they try to charm their way into the hearts of bridesmaids and hope to go home with them later that evening,3
"(uhh) But during this one party of the US (uhh) Secretary of Treasury, played by Christopher Walken (uhh) the guys, Owen Wilson's character actually finds himself falling for (uhh) the Secretary's daughter, and they invite them to go home with them to their estate over the weekend and he actually (uhh) pleads Vince Vaughns character to come with him and join him (uhh) over the weekend at this big estate",0
And most of the movie takes place at this estate,0
It's hilarious,1
(umm) I was laughing (stutter) right through the movie,0
I can't even stop laughing,1
(umm) And there's some special features which give about eight and a half more minutes to the movie,3
I suggest going to pick this up tonight if you were looking for a hilarious comedy,1
"Go out and rent it, it's great",2
"Hello, I'm going to do a movie review and it is about the previous number one movie Meet the Spartans",0
"Well there's one thing that you need to know about Meet the Spartans, it is like three hundred, (stutter) obviously as you should know",0
(stutter) It has a British guy from (uhh) Off Center and also in other (stutter) like movies,-3
(uhh) He also (uhh) was in (stutter) NYPD Blue like blue city and such,-1
And like (umm) Well Meet the Spartans is a very cheap knock off,-2
"It wasn't that great, it was really bad",-2
"(stutter) It was spent a whole bunch of money on it, but it wasn't that great",-2
Some (stutter) like people expected it to be great because of three hundred but it wasn't,0
Like it was pretty offensive,0
The things like like (stutter) the fight scene,-2
Like when (umm) xxx it was really offensive and it wasn't that funny and like they were they (stutter) like pretty they go to the extreme all the time,1
"Like, they also (umm) explain the riff of the materials they use so it's like, what the heck? I, the first twenty minutes when I watched it, it was kinda like three hundred, but a little bit different by adding comedy",-3
"It wasn't that great, it wasn't (stutter) good and it wasn't that funny",0
"Like, sure it has cheap cheap jokes",0
But it wasn't that great,-3
"Like seriously like (umm) (uhh) xxx (stutter) In the beginning they had like, there's a child like, as a seeing who which child can (uhh) get along and it was Shrek and you're like what the heck, that's pretty funny",-3
"Ha ha ha, but after awhile you're just like, oh okay",-2
"And it's just like three hundred, but weirder and not, like they tried to be funny",-2
You have to admit that,-2
"But it's not that great, so I highly do not recommend you to watch Meet The Spartans",0
"Hi, I'm going to review for you today the DVD of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider",1
"This is not a very good movie at all, but if you like the video game Tomb Raider it's based on that and that was one of my very favorite favorite video games ever, and so of course I had to get the movie",-1
(umm) The plot in it's really bad,1
The acting's not that great,-1
"It's fun to watch (umm) (uhh) Angeline Jolie be Tomb Raider, but I mean it's not really not that interesting",-2
"There's a lot of action and fighting and shooting, but the bad guy's not even that bad, I think",-1
He's just does a typical overacting sort of job,-1
"(umm) If you can find it for cheap and you like Tomb Raider that would be a good thing to get it, but don't pay over five dollars for this",1
It's not really worth it,-1
(umm) If you can see it on TV for free that's good too,-2
But the DVD has special edition stuff so if you wanna see (uhh) behind the scenes and things like that,-1
"So if you can find it for cheap, buy it",2
"Hello Expo, this is my video review for the movie Meet the Spartans",0
(umm) I came into the movie with very low expectations,-2
"Like, I knew it wasn't gonna be good",-1
Since the trailer,-2
"I heard that people thought it was gonna be like, really hilariously funny and they're not really smart",0
If they thought that way,1
And I watched it because I had nothing else better to do,-2
"Anyway, (umm) the movie is a parody of three hundred and a parody of other (stutter) movies and celebrities like Shrek, little bit of Happy Feet, You Got Served",-3
(umm) Paris Hilton and other stuff,1
And (umm) there were probably two or three things that were kind of entertaining for me which is a surprise cuz I expected much of my expectations were much lower than two or three laughs,0
"Cuz like I was expecting like, I was gonna stare at wallpaper kind of movie",-2
"And but there were some scenes that were, that went over the top with trying to make it humorous by, and, (stutter) it ended up just being disturbing or disgusting",0
"And (uhh) lucky for me I have a way to like, shut that off like, if I know like a really horrible scene's gonna come up I'm just gonna like, go into my zone",-2
Or whatever,0
"And I give this movie a two out of five because it's a bad movie, that's no surprise",-1
Even if you haven't seen the movie you should know it's a bad movie,-1
But it's not as bad as I thought it would be,-1
You know,1
Hello expotv land,2
"It's me, Danny Ericson, and I'm here to talk to you today about the movie currently in theaters Meet the Spartans",1
"And I don't know (stutter) why I did, but I went to this movie cause I knew I would hate it, cause I hate all movies like this",1
"Like exactly what the Scary Movies have become, the last three-hundred they made, and things like The Comebacks",-2
They're just all these lame attempts that just keep on referencing movies over and over and they're just not even funny,-3
"Like, they just have, I just don't know how they come up with them, they're not funny",-3
Meet the Spartans was just the same way,-1
(umm) They're talking about the Three-Hundred and really they just keep on bringing up things that aren't funny,-2
"They're all trying to make this topical humor like Britney Spears, just all this ridiculous stuff that doesn't make sense and isn't, just not funny",-2
"I don't know why they keep on making these kinds movie and I just hope they don't make more movies like this, cause Three-Hundred just came out last year and they already made a parody of it",1
I just don't know,-2
These people seem to not have anything else to do with their time,-2
I just don't like it and I hope they don't keep on making more like this,-2
Hello Expo TV,1
"Tonight I would like to share with you Men Seeking Women, starring Will Ferrel and a couple other horribly unfunny people",-2
(uhh) I highly advise you stay as far away (uhh) from this movie as you can,-2
"It's one of those things where a company has a movie with someone in it and they realize that person is now famous so they pull it out and put it on DVD to trick people into buying it because it has someone they love, being Will Ferrel",-2
"(uhh) It has him right there on the cover, (uhh) twice, in the picture and standing here",-3
"He's all over the back, because no one else cares about the other people in this movie",-2
(uhh) It has the little smarmy glasses wearing guy from Murphy Brown,-3
(uhh) It's just not awesome,-2
It's about these best friends and there's something about them trying to get married in a certain amount of time,0
I honestly can't even tell you that I watched the movie all the way through,-2
It made me sick to my stomach,-2
"(uhh) Like I said it's cheap, I think it runs like five bucks which is why I picked it up, I should of known better",-2
But (uhh) consider this a warning to avoid Men Seeking Women,2
(uhh) Will Ferrel the parts that I watched you know he's kind of funny but the writing in it's terrible and they don't really give him much to work with and it seems like he kind of may have had a jerk director that wouldn't let him you know do his thing and experiment and play around and be as (uhh) (uhh) improvious as he would want to be,-2
"What's up guys I am going to review a movie that I think and actually many people agree with me (uhh) critics and fans alike that is one of or maybe the best war movie (umm) ever made and it's called Saving Private Ryan it stars Tom Hank's of course (umm) Matt Damon and a cast of others including Vin Diesel if you're a fan of his and it's about (umm) you know a setting in World War Two and a mother who has lost three of her four sons in the war, so there is one squadron's mission to go and find the fourth son whose name is Private Ryan (umm) the movie goes through that it goes through the realities of war and World War Two what happened there and what happened to them (umm) It's seen through the eyes of these soldiers you know they question their orders they don't understand why they have to risk their life (umm) Ryan questions his orders he just wants to stay and fight for his country (umm) and really just goes through their struggles of your your (stutter) everyday you know American soldier in World War Two, and it's poignant and it's beautiful, and you know it won five academy awards including best director Steven Spielberg of course you know it's hailed by everybody Time Magazine, USA Today, New York Times, Entertainment Weekly, (umm) it won best picture award at the the (stutter) Toronto broadcast film critic special",2
Hi guys,0
(umm) Today I'll be talking about the movie Semi-Pro,0
(umm) This movie is the latest release (umm) in which Will Ferrell is the main leading character,0
(umm) Supposed to be a comedy movie but it's not much comedy,-2
I enjoyed Will Ferrell's last movie Blades of Glory but this movie's (umm) not up to that mark of comedy,-1
(umm) In this movie (umm) Will Ferrell is the coach and the star player of the American Basketball Association team,0
(umm) The name of the team was the Tropics and then (umm) and there was a competition if their team xxx xxx xxx that then their team would be totally (umm) like moshed into some other team,-1
"So, he basically had to push all all (stutter) of his players to play a good nice game",0
"But (umm) mean, it it (stutter) was (umm) not that interesting movie",-2
"So, (umm) I'm probably gonna give this movie (umm) like two out of five",-1
"Hello, Will here and today I'll be reviewing Charlie's Angels",0
"(uhh) This is not the full throttle version, this is the first one",1
And it's pretty good,1
"I wouldn't go out and say, you know, go out of your way and buy it, but if you like (uhh) Drew Barrymore and Carmen Diaz's acting, and Lucy Liu, go out and buy it",-1
Otherwise it's not really worth the price,-1
(umm) It was okay,-1
"It didn't really (umm) reflect the series as well as everyone thought it should have, if you're a fan of the Charlie's Angels TV series",-1
"I mean, the the (stutter) people elements are there, it's just not really the same, so (umm) I don't know, with special features and all I would say you know, don't go out and get it",-3
"(umm) If you're going go out and get you know, you get this one and full throttle which is the second Charlie's Angels (umm) together for cheap, go ahead but don't bother",-2
Hey y'all,1
It's the king of movies here and today I'm going to (stutter) review Step Up Two the Streets which is a new movie in theaters,1
"(uhh) It's a teen, teen kind of drama about (stutter) {burp} excuse me, dancing",-2
"(uhh) If you're interested at all in dancing (uhh) like (stutter) street, excuse me, street style dancing (uhh) like (uhh) (stutter) You Got Served and that kind of dancing you might enjoy this film",-1
(umm) I thought it was pretty formulaic and (uhh) just like typical teen melodrama stuff that we've been seeing (uhh) for the last several years,0
(uhh) Just like regurgitated stuff,-1
However I must admit that the choreographed dance scenes are (uhh) quite a sight to see and they're really top notch,0
"If you're a fan of dancing in that sense, just like to watch people dance, see impressive dance moves then you might want to check out this movie solely for that",0
"The actual plot, however, is formulaic and not really worth seeing",-2
"It's kind of one of those movies where (uhh) it's stretched out to ninety minutes just to be a full length movie but it would have been perfectly fine just showing the the (stutter) choreographed (uhh) dance scenes, like a ten minute short or like something on TV, or even just like put someone put up a clip on youtube of just people dancing",-1
It's it's (stutter) that kind of movie where they just stretch it out with an unnecessary plot that's formulaic and (stutter) try to turn it into a movie and it it (stutter) ultimately fails in in (stutter) the sense of a movie,1
Wouldn't recommend seeing it in theaters (umm) just because the plot and stuff like that is all just regurgitated and (stutter) formulaic,0
Instead (uhh) watch the dance scenes,-2
"Hopefully one day, when the DVD comes out or something, you'll be able to just easily watch it on youtube or (uhh) rent it even, just to see the dance scenes because the rest of the movie is just there kind of to fill up space and make it ninety minute, minute (stutter) (uhh) feature length",2
"(uhh) So if you're, so that's (uhh) Step Up Two the Streets",1
(uhh) If you're interested in dancing you might maybe check it out,-2
"If you have, if you hate dancing there's no point in even checking this out really cause the plot sucks and (uhh) the dancing is only there for people that enjoy dancing",0
"Hey, ExpoTV",0
Today I'm here to talk about the movie Boarding Gate,0
(umm) Watching this movie is probably one of the biggest wastes of my time (umm) in recent memory,-3
"(umm) I should have known that going in, but I didn't listen",-2
"(umm) What this movie is about is Asia Argento, who plays an ex-prostitute",-2
"(umm) And she's forced (umm) to flee England, (umm) London (umm) after a {sigh} bad encounter (umm) during one of her jobs",0
"And (uhh), as you can tell, the movie is already completely ridiculous and not something you want to watch",-3
"(umm) But she's forced to flee, and she takes up with a different couple",-2
"And, you know, they promise to get her her (stutter) passport, her visa, all the necessary papers (umm) obviously in exchange for services",-2
(umm) And it basically turns out to be a manipulation on the couple's end against Sandra,-2
(umm) So a completely ridiculous story,-1
(umm) No value in watching this at all,0
You don't learn anything from this movie,0
You don't get a good feeling afterwards,-2
"(umm) After watching it, I just felt a little bit sick, a little bit disgusted, like why did I just waste my time watching that? (umm) So I think most people would get that feeling after seeing this",0
"Like I said, there's really nothing that sticks out that would be even remotely good about this movie",0
(umm) Even the acting is poor,0
"Hi, today I'm going to do a movie currently in theaters for view for you of a movie called ten thousand B",0
,-1
(umm) ten thousand B,-2
,-2
"is about (umm) you know, it takes place in ten thousand B",-2
,-2
(umm) A prehistoric culture (umm) and it kind of revolves around a young man who is hunting mammoths and (umm) trying to save his tribe,-3
"This movie though, this movie is absolutely awful",-3
I (umm) I couldn't recommend this to anybody,-2
"There's all kinds of things going around that don't seem to actually make any sense,(umm) especially in regards to historical accuracy",-2
"(umm) Number one, you've got you know pyramids being built, you've got vultures on like mammoths and you've got people of different kinds of (umm) races sometimes, it's just like ten thousand B",0
,-3
", this is not probable",-1
(umm) It's not true and (umm) the movie is really terrible,0
They don't develop into the characters at all,1
(umm) Throughout the duration of the movie I don't feel a sense to any of the characters,-3
And also the acting is just some of the worst acting I've ever seen,-3
And If I could say this (umm) {laugh} just save your money,-2
"Hey, ExpoTV",0
This is Aubs eighty four and today I'm going to talk to you about the movie The Wedding Director,0
(umm) This is a foreign film,1
(umm) It's set in France and it's definitely subtitled,-1
"So if you're not a fan of sub-titles, you're gonna want to steer clear of this one",-3
"(umm) If you don't mind subtitles and you're into foreign films, I would still say don't get your hopes up",0
"It's just, it really isn't that good",0
"Honestly, I was bored out of my mind and couldn't wait for this film to be over",0
It was long,-1
It it (stutter) drew on and on,-2
"(umm) In typical foreign film fashion, it was all about character development, and all about the background story and getting to know people",1
"And, you know, generally I don't mind that",0
"But when it's, in terms of this movie it was just so pointless and didn't seem to go anywhere and was just kind of a big circle of ridiculousness actually",0
"(umm) The basic plot of the story is that this guy, Franco, is a film maker and he's worried about (uhh) getting his daughter married to this extremist religious guy who's kind of crazy",-1
So he's all whipped up about that and all of a sudden this scandal breaks loose and Franco's forced to flee his country,-2
He has to leave (umm) because he's kind of been indicted for some things,-2
He's not looking very good,-3
He's not gonna be making any more movies anytime soon in his homeland,1
"(umm) So he leaves and in his new city, he ends up being there and he meets this guy who finds out he's a film director and says, well can you film my daughter's wedding And Franco says, sure, I'll do that",-1
And basically what happens is he's filming the wedding and he falls in love with this woman who's getting married,-2
"So it's kind of, it's all out there",-1
It's a little bit ridiculous with the extremist religious thing at the beginning and then the scandal and then falling in love with the girl,-1
And it kind of doesn't really fit together,-2
"(umm) I think any one of those three things could have been it's own separate movie and it would've been a better production, rather than trying to ravel all three of these things into one long, drawn-out and ridiculous film",0
I think it would be enough to swallow (umm) the whole scandal thing,-2
"And I can't, I can't (stutter) even go into all the detail around the scandal thing because it's so in-depth",-1
And so (umm) convoluted and messy,-2
You just kind of have to watch the movie and read the subtitles for yourself (umm) in order to figure it all out,-1
"And even for myself, I still wonder if I got the whole thing right",-3
It's that messy,-1
(umm) And that was my least favorite part about the movie was that scandal and the huge shebang that happened because of it,-3
"It, it (stutter) could have been simplified or done as it's own movie where you can spend the time getting into and really explaining and delving into the whole situation",-2
"(umm) When you try to combine it into a whole other movie like it was done in this one, it's just to much to digest",0
It would have took me another two or three viewings (uhh) just to to (stutter) figure this out,-2
"And I don't think any movie should be that complex or that complicated, foreign or not",-2
I mean entertainment value here is what I want and that's not what I was given in this film at all,1
I'm only gonna give it a one out of five rating,1
(umm) I can't think of anything (uhh) for the movie as a whole that would have increased that rating,-3
"(umm) If they would've broken it up I mean, then it's just different films so you can't even, it's comparing apples to oranges kind of",-2
(umm) But that would've been a better alternative to what they did here,-3
(umm) I I've (stutter) seen some foreign film lately that I really enjoyed,-3
I really got into the story line and really felt part of these characters,-2
But this one was kind of fantastical and weird and out there and just not worth my time,-2
"Again, one out of five stars",-2
Don't waste your time seeing it in a theater,-3
Don't even waste your time renting this one,-1
It's just not worth it,-1
What's up expo tv,0
I have a movie review for Superhero Movie,0
(uhh) Currently in theaters,1
"It's about ninety minutes long and it's rated PG-thirteen for (uhh) crude and sexual content, comic violence, drug references, language",-2
(uhh) It's from the makers of Scary Movie but this one's rated PG-thirteen,-2
(uhh) I guess so more people can see it,-3
"It it's (stutter) not as good as the original Scary Movie, and it's not as good as pretty much any spoof movie",-3
I thought it was kind of bad,-3
"(uhh) I guess the movie's about how (uhh) how this kid named Rick gets bitten by this dragonfly and and (stutter) he becomes known as, like the dragonfly because he gets all these like, superpowers like he gets I guess like, he gets really strong, his skin gets like tough",-1
And (uhh) it's just like I guess like (stutter) spoof on spiderman and pretty much every other superhero (stutter) movie that's currently out,-2
(uhh) He goes off and fights crime against like this guy called the hourglass,-3
(uhh) Not that good of a movie as I said,-1
It could have been a lot better,0
"(uhh) It's like one of the most stupid comedies, like you don't really laugh that much, but, but (stutter) you laugh at some parts but as soon as it ends you're like, I just wasted like, ninety minutes of my life and like like (stutter) ten dollars",-1
(uhh) So I really don't recommend seeing it,0
Don't see it in the theaters,0
Do not see it on dvd,-2
(uhh) Just completely ignore like this movie,-2
"I don't get how these movies get put in like like (stutter) theaters, or like production even",0
Like who wants to do this,0
Hello Expo TV,-1
(umm) Today I'm reviewing the movie Death Race,0
(uhh) This means two out of five,-2
(uhh) It really wasn't very good,-1
(uhh) It stars Jason Statham,-1
"You might recognize him from the Crank movies, where he was like a getaway driver kind of, drug runner",-1
"Anyways, (umm) where do I start? (umm) The movie takes place in two thousand twelve",-1
It's about a guy that goes to prison for a crime he didn't commit,-3
"It's a like, for profit prison where they have this pay-per-view creation that's these death races and they have convicts racing in like cars with all kinds of crazy stuff like missiles and flamethrowers and machine guns and they kill each other and if you win, it's five races, you get your freedom",0
"So, that's kind of the premise of the movie",0
(umm) Honestly that sounds pretty stupid,-2
I don't even know why I saw it,-2
(uhh) But at least now you guys are warned,0
Don't see Death Race,0
(uhh) I wouldn't even rent it,-2
It's really pretty bad,0
"(uhh) I mean, there's a lot of action",-1
"If you like senseless action, Death Race is your movie",0
I am reviewing shop girl,0
"Has Steve Martin, Claire Danes, and Jason Jason (stutter) Schwartzman and (umm) the movie is rated R",0
And it is described as a cute romantic comedy on the back,-2
I would not recommend this movie at all {laughter},1
It is based on a short novel or novella written by Steve Martin,-2
"And so I had these expectations that this movie would be along the lines of (umm) Roxanne or (umm) You've Got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle, Never Been Kissed, that kind of cute romantic comedy",1
"It is, to me very dark",1
(umm) It's actually a little odd,-1
It's this girl (umm) basically is kinda torn between these two guys,-1
A young guy that's not going anywhere and a rich older entrepreneur who's Steve Martin,0
"But he has issues and the young guy has issues and there's a lot of sex in it and it's, it's just not a movie at all that I would recommend",-1
"Hello, my name is Mike, and today I'll be talking to you about the movie Traitor, which I went and saw last night",1
"As formality, here is my movie ticket",0
And there it went,-3
"So, Traitor is a movie about (uhh), it's a basic spy movie",-2
"The premise here is really not good in any way, shape, or form",-3
But I will try to hack it together for you,-2
"So, this (uhh), sort of, straight-laced FBI dude is investigating (uhh), a bunch of crazy stuff that happened",-2
"And it turns out that this other sort of counter intelligence dude for the US, (uhh) is always seems to be connected to all of it",-1
"So, it's, he has to figure out what's going on and why this is happening and is person number two involved with this, and is he a good guy or a bad guy, is the people is coming to help him investigate and are they good or bad is there other interests in here",-3
That's the premise,-3
It's a really bad spy movie cause it really feels like there's no real story to it,-2
"There's the investigation element, but that's it",0
"You know, what's the story, what's the point",0
There is none,-1
That's the flaw of this movie,-2
"The script was written as sort of a, sub-element",-2
"You know, it's missing the greater story to which the script plugs in to",-3
"And, that's why I can't give this movie anything more than a one out of five, cause it was atrocious",-3
"And this isn't worth seeing at all, cause I mean, come on, you can come up with better spy movies than this",-2
There are so many,-3
"And I mean, not necessarily like spy like, James Bond, but counter, like you know, investigation spy movies",-2
There are so many better ones to be doing,-1
"So, I have to say, one out of five",-3
This was horrible,-1
The premise is barely there at all,0
It's like a quarter of a movie but running the full length,-1
"Which is bad because the actors do a good job, but that cannot save it from being an atrocious pile of junk",-1
"So, one out five for Traitor",0
Hi there,0
"I just returned from the theater and I saw this really really bad movie called (umm) Beer for My Horses and like I said, did I mention that it was bad? Well it was bad",-3
"It has Tom Skerrit in it, (uhh) that's not a reflection on him cause he's actually a good actor, it's got Toby Keith, who he's a country music singer and if you're listening to country music that's fine but he really shouldn't be acting, and it's also got (uhh) Ted Nugent",-3
He's a former (umm) rock singer or whatever but he's not really an actor either,-3
So I mean you're you're (stutter) putting these people together to make this really bad movie and I guess that's what you're gonna get,-2
It's rated PG-thirteen,-2
The premise of it is there's these two deputies that are trying to do something,-2
The sheriff doesn't really want them to do it but they do it anyway,0
So they take this road trip and that's kind of how the movie goes,-2
"and like I said, you watch it for yourself and see what you think",-2
"I mean I wouldn't recommend you watch it, cause it was bad enough that I watched it one time",-2
(uhh) I wouldn't see it at the theater and I wouldn't rent it either,0
I'd just try to forget about it,0
"(uhh) Kinda like it was a bad dream, you know",0
Just forget it had ever happened,0
But (umm) that's my opinion anyway,-1
"Some Boards have provision for committee members to serve who are not full Board members, not voting members of the Board.",-1
And this was another way to help bring in that expertise.,-1
So you may not have all of the skills and abilities that you need for the audit committee on your full voting Board members but you among your committee members that expertise.,0
"Student affairs academic affairs, that's another area where you may have some non-Board members serving.",0
"For instance, we don't necessarily recommend the students serve as voting members of the Board because of conflict of interest concerns, but students could be a wonderful asset on the student affairs committee and can serve as full members of the committee and vote on proposals that will come before the Board but aren't voting as full Board members when the resolutions of the Board are passed.",0
"Hi, my name is Logan and this piece of dog crap is The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen",-3
This (uhh) stars Sean Connery,0
It's just so stupid,-2
"(umm) It's set in like the eighteen hundreds and it's like fantasy and (uhh) you know, the (stutter) first of all the main star, or the main guy in (stutter), there's like all these like Captain Nemo's in it and then other people, other famousishy people from around that time were in it",-3
I have never heard of Alan Quartermain,-2
I don't know what they were thinking when they decided that Sean Connery should star as Alan Quartermain,-3
It doesn't make any sense but (uhh) I don't know,-3
It it's (stutter) pretty dumb,-2
"There's like a vampire in it, an invisible guy, Captain Nemo, a guy that can't die cause he's like he starts out as a good guy and then he goes to a bad guy",-2
It's really just a dull story line,-2
"It was an excuse to get Sean Connery into a James Bondish role without being James Bond cause they didn't want to pay for that and he (stutter) shoots people and he acts like oh I'm Sean Connery {mumble} you gotta shoot people, this is how you do it",-2
I can't do a very (stutter) good Sean Connery voice but this was really lame movie,-3
"I mean, come on Sean, can't do you do better than that? (stutter) It's just {sigh}",-3
It's like he was really hurting for money so he picked the first script that came along,-3
"It's just a horrible, stupid movie",-3
It doesn't make a lot of sense,-3
"The action sequences are sometimes way too long and sometimes they're too short and it just, it jumps around, it's like oh he's going to his, you know, his (uhh) his castle of fortressness, we have to go get him",-1
So they go up into the mountains or something after the bad guy,-1
"It's like how do they know he was there? Why did he go there? That's like the first place you would think he would go, why would you I don't know",-2
"It was a really dull story line, it doesn't make a lot of sense",-2
Don't get this movie,-3
"It's from the director of Blade, that should have told me in the first place cause Blade sucked, this sucks",-1
"Don't rent it, don't buy it, don't waste your time",-2
Hey,1
"ExpoTV I am DJ Mel here and I will be reviewing myself, no I am not so why did I tell you my name? Anyways, today I am reviewing (stutter) Denzel Washington's Deja Vu",1
"This movie is, this movie is PG thirteen, thirteen, yes (umm) (uhh) This is starring touched, no (stutter) that's not him I'm sorry (uhh) it is (uhh) brought to you by Jerry Bruckheimer Films and Touchstone Pictures",1
"(umm) I would've, I watched this movie once, four years ago for something, didn't really like it, it's (stutter) suspenseful but, meaningless at the same time and it has a confusing plot so if you're looking for a good watch, like a classic watch like you're going to watch an old movie, (umm) and you're you're (stutter) looking for an action or a suspense movie, don't get Deja Vu, you'll get like Shanghai Knights",-3
Just any Jackie Chan movie will do,2
"So {laughter} anyways, this this (stutter) not a great movie, so yeah, don't watch it",-2
Hi expo,1
"Today I'd like to do a movie review for you of a movie that's currently in theaters so I have my ticket stub for here, and that's Bride Wars",0
"Bride Wars is a movie starring (umm) Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway as Liv and Emma who are two girls who are best friends who get engaged at about the same time and (umm) they're plan to do everything together, being each other's maids of honor, et cetera et cetera",-2
And they both want to get married at the same place until they find out that only one of them can get married at the Plaza,0
(umm) And a small war between them begins (umm) because they both just (umm) don't want to make any compromises,0
"This movie (umm) if you saw previews for it it looks kind of funny, but this movie actually wasn't very funny",0
"It was very (umm) average, very predictable, and the acting wasn't that great",-1
(umm) And you know I really do like to see fluffy chick flicks sometimes so I'm not against that but this one was pretty terrible,-2
And I definitely recommend that if you're considering going to see Bride Wars that you save your money because it's not that good,-2
"So if you're looking for a movie to see with your girlfriends on a Friday night or a fluffy chick flick I would not recommend seeing Bride Wars because it's not what you expect, it's not worth the money, and it's not that good",-2
So I don't give it a good review,-2
Bride Wars,-2
"Hello and welcome to my review of Pinata, Survival Island",0
This is a story of a bunch of college students who go to an island for (umm) a treasure hunt,0
"And they end up breaking this ancient pinata which releases some demon and then of course, chaos ensues",0
This movie is pretty bad,0
It is (umm) {laugh} it's less than a B movie,0
"The only reason to see this is (umm) if you are a fan of Jaime Pressly or Nicholas Brandon, (umm) those are the two stars",-2
(uhh) Jaime Pressly of course from My Name Is Earl fame and Nicholas Brendon from Buffy the Vampire Slayer,-2
"Only reason why the, to really to see this movie",-1
"The special features there aren't very many, there's a feature commentary and some other junk but who who (stutter) really cares because this movie is pretty bad",0
(umm) I I (stutter) have to mention that on the back of the dvd it actually says evil has gone wack,-2
"So if that gives you any indication of where this movie is going, (umm) if that doesn't I don't know what will",-2
"So this is Pinata, Survival Island",0
"You know, for the last few days I've been trying to think of words to describe how it feels to be on the other side of APH's Annual Meeting from teacher, O&amp;M, CLVT, and user of products, to EOT in two different states and and now to APH employee",1
"And I guess the first thing I'd like to say it was really cool to celebrate my birthday with over 300 of my favorite people, so thank you very much for that",3
"But you know, I was wondering was I was I like a proud mama and I thought no, that would insinuate that I had a hand in shaping this amazing organization and event and I'm really much to new at APH to claim that, so I settled instead on Auntie as in ""Auntie Dorinda is so proud to be part of this organization and event and the deep roots and branches we build",2
""" The depth of my feelings go way beyond that though to all of you",3
I'm so grateful to all of you who traveled to Louisville and I know that you left overflowing email boxes that continued to overflow while you were here,3
And you left piles of work and you came here to participate in related meetings and in product sessions and our new roundtable discussions and I'm really glad to hear that you enjoyed those,2
I'm hoping we're going to continue that in the future,2
And then of course the many celebrations and then the hallway conversations that we all enjoy so much,3

Hi Federationists! Lauren McLarney here with the Government Affairs team,1
"I'm on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC",1
It's freezing! But I'm really excited because in two weeks we're going to do one of the coolest things that we do as an organization,-2
500 Federationists are going to come here to DC and we're going to hike the hill together to tell our members of Congress about our legislative priorities and the things that we need to live the lives we want,1
"Our three legislative priorities this year are the Transitioning to Meaningful and Integrated Employment Act or the TIME Act, the Technology, Education and Accessibility in College and Higher Education Act or the TEACH Act and the Marrakesh Treaty",1
Here are some more details about the three legislative priorities,0
,0
I'm Rose Sloan and this year we are advocating for the Transitioning to Integrated and Meaningful Employment Act or the TIME Act,1
The title of the TIME Act explains exactly what we want nonprofits who hold Section 14(c) Certificates to do,-2
"We want them to transition their business model to ensure that all people with disabilities, especially those being paid subminimum wages have the opportunity to transition into integrated and meaningful employment that they strive for",-2
"Currently, over four-hundred thousand Americans with disabilities are being paid less than the minimum wage, some of them mere pennies per hour",2
But the TIME Act will give nonprofit entities three years to transition their business model and ensure that all people with disabilities are paid the fair wages we deserve,1
It's time for people with disabilities to receive fair wages,2
"The second issue this year is the Technology, Education and Accessibility in College and Higher Education Act or the TEACH Act which works to address a problem facing far too many blind and otherwise print disabled students in college",0
The print world is inherently inaccessible to blind people and electronic instructional materials like PDFs and learning management systems and ebooks,-1
They offer the opportunity for blind students to use the exact same materials as their sighted peers and luckily the law actually requires that institutions of higher education provide equal access,1
"The problem is that requirement has no specifics, no criteria, no guidelines telling schools this is what accessibility looks like and this is what you should demand from the market",1
"Schools have no idea what to ask for, manufacturers aren't really embracing accessibility solutions and blind students are the ones that pay the price",2
"The TEACH Act authorizes the creation of voluntary accessibility guidelines so this is what accessibility looks like, this is what you should demand from the market and then incentivizes schools to only use technology that conforms to those guidelines with a safe harbor from litigation",2
"Our goal is to improve access for blind students, reduce litigation and stimulate an accessible digital marketplace",-1
"Hi, this is Scott LaBarre and I'm here to talk to you about the Marrakesh Treaty, what's also been called the ""Book Treaty",1
""" This year we are going before the United States Senate and urging them to ratify the Marrakesh Treaty",2
This would allow us to get books from all over the world in foreign languages and even in English that are already produced in Braille or other accessible formats,1
It will allow the rest of the world to get access to the collections we have here in the United States,0
"We believe that the right to read, the right to information is a fundamental right and by ratifying Marrakesh we will secure a major victory in our right to read campaign",2
Now that you have all the details I hope you're as excited as I am,1
Last year was an election year and a lot of people were complaining,1
"Hi, my name is Anaj and today I'm reviewing the movie Boxing Helena",1
"(umm) It's a psychological thriller, if you haven't watched it it's a nice movie",1
It's about this doctor who's kind of psychologically (uhh) crazy,-1
"He's really generous, you know, really rich, but he wants this girl who's kind of a seductress and (uhh) well the movie's R rated",0
It has some (uhh) adult scenes in it with them,1
"And (uhh) it's an alright movie, I didn't like the acting of the guy (uhh) Julian Sands and Sherilyn Fenn so the acting was just alright",0
"(uhh) A onetime movie, definitely not my type though",-1
"It it (stutter) is a thriller (umm) he wants this woman, the woman is you know not interested in the guy so he finds a (uhh), I won't tell the story but he gets possession of this girl and then tries to take care and win her heart over, but (uhh) the story's (uhh) related to that",-1
"Watch this movie (umm) one time see, not bad",0
"DVD (uhh) I'm not sure if you'd want it in your collection, I won't suggest it though",1
(uhh) Not many special features either,-2

Hi,-1
I'm reviewing the (uhh) DVD release of Basic,0
It stars (uhh) John Travolta and Samuel Jackson,0
It's (uhh) a military movie,0
"(umm) John Travolta is sent to, to (stutter) investigate the disappearance of Samuel Jackson who's (uhh) a disliked drill sergeant",0
(umm) They think he's too tough on the recruits and they think that he may have gotten some of them killed,0
(umm) I did not care for this movie at all,-3
(uhh) The twists and the turns weren't really inspired or creative or (stutter) even interesting,-2
It just seemed like they came up with random things to happen that (uhh) I don't know,-2
"It just, by the time you get to the end of the movie it felt like a waste of time to have watched any of it",-2
Hi I'm reviewing Postmortem,0
"Starring (uhh) Charlie Sheen (umm) I guess now he's trying to take himself seriously since the box says, Charles Sheen, but (uhh) this is not a movie I would pick if I was Charles Sheen to launch my serious movie career",-2
(uhh) In the movie he plays a (uhh) serial killer profiler,0
Which there are a million of in movies,-1
And he retires to become a novelist but he moves to a small town to get away from it all and it turns out that the small town has a serial killer so he has to help track him down,-1
(uhh) It's not (uhh) a very good movie,-3
"I didn't enjoy watching it, there's no special features",-2
(uhh) So it's a pretty poor DVD,-3
"(uhh) Overall I really can't say anything positive about this, I wouldn't recommend watching it",-3
(uhh) I actually think it went straight to DVD,-1

The Hills Have Eyes Two,-1
"I enjoyed The Hills Have Eyes, the remake that came out a couple years ago and (umm) this is the sequel to it, of course",0
(umm) Going into the movie I knew the plot,-2
"You know, it's the hills have eyes, the first the one the family gets trapped, stays in the hills, (umm) which used to be, they used to test nuclear weapons there",-1
"Some of the people stayed, they killed the people, and that's what happens",-1
"So in this one it's (umm) the same premise, nuclear testing still going on the grounds",-2
"This time the army goes in there to test weapons and (umm) they go in there to to (stutter) do stuff, they have (umm) workers and stuff go in there, and (umm)",-3
So if you saw The Hills Have Eyes One you're probably thinking why not add soldiers? But (umm) it was it was a bad movie,-1
"it wasn't the worst movie, and on a scale of one to ten I'd say it was probably a three",1
"(umm) But it was, it was (stutter) bad",0
I knew it was going to be bad,0
I wanted to see it just to see it,0
But I knew going in it was going to be bad and it wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be,0
"(umm) It was still pretty bad, you know? Most of the people in the movie I didn't know",-2
"(umm) A couple of the people I did, I knew who they were, but (umm) it (stutter) was a very bad movie",-2
"(umm) Like I said, nuclear testing and then the army goes in to to (stutter) do stuff and then most of them get killed",-2
Hello again,0
"This is the Derek, this time with another DVD review and this one is one of (uhh) I mean come on if you were ever a teenage boy or (uhh) in the eighties or nineties or even nowadays, every party has a little (stutter) bit of a nerd, you will love Rush, the rock band Rush",2
This is a concert (uhh) DVD that came out,0
"It's a double disk (uhh) Rush R30, so their thirtieth anniversary world tour, has a DVD one is one entire huge concert live that pretty well plays every one of their hits (uhh) including most of the twenty-one twelve (uhh) over (uhh) their (stutter) (uhh) to (umm) all some some (stutter) new ones like earthshine",1
"(uhh) spanning thirty years of their career of such a phenomenal band (uhh) that, that (stutter) really is more influential to rock (uhh) and than than (stutter) so many other bands out there, I mean there are still going today",3
"(umm) The second disk has a bunch of interviews with them, it has a vault of other, you know, music videos and some more live performances",1
"But one of the special things for this whole box set is really when you open it up, it has such a beautiful presentation to any fan that shows you (uhh) a retrospective of the the years, has a (uhh) a live CD over here so you can listen to the live concert in your car, has the two disks, it also has (umm) some (uhh) autographed (uhh) guitar picks",3
"They are not really autographed by they have their signatures on them from Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson and also has a (uhh) great little booklet of photos with (uhh) other trinkets it thrown in like stickers, (uhh) (stutter) and a replica of a backstage pass so you can pretend that you were ever at one of these concerts",2
"It's a great (uhh) box set, amazingly good sound, (uhh) lots of easter eggs on here, they even say on the back good luck finding them, but I can't recommend it better if you are a fan to listen to one of their greater concerts that they have put on a long time in adobe five point one audio",3
"I definitely pick it up if you are a fan, if you just are a kid today and want to know what a great rock band out there is still living and, and working and breathing sounds like you know, pick it up and check it out",2
I'm doing a review for the movie Ghost Rider starring Nicolas Cage and Eva Mendes,0
(umm) This was probably the worst Marvel movie I have ever seen,-3
"(uhh) It's even better than Dare (stutter), or even worse than Daredevil I mean",-2
"I actually liked Daredevil a little bit, but this was just awful",-2
"(umm) It stars Cage as the Ghost Rider, a supernatural (uhh) bounty hunter of the devil, who has to go and chase another bad guy called Black Heart (umm) before he can collect souls and become super powerful",-1
(uhh) The story was really boring,1
(uhh) It didn't go anywhere for a long time,-2
"(uhh) The special effects were pretty good, I'll give them that",-3
"(uhh) Watching (umm) Nicolas Cage transform into the Ghost Rider and back, seeing his flesh peel away, things like that",-1
It was cool to see that,-3
(uhh) But other than that there weren't many positives in this movie,-2
"(umm) It was just, I was just waiting for this movie to be over it was so boring",2
"(umm) Eva Mendes can't really act well, but she is extremely easy on the eyes",1
"So if you need an excuse to see that movie (uhh) fellas, that's one",1
This is a review of the dvd movie Gosford Park,0
"(umm) It came out in two thousand one on USA Films, also on Universal",0
(umm) {laugh} I'm not gonna lie I saw the previews for this movie in two thousand one when it came out,-1
For some reason I had thought that this was going to be like (uhh) like a horror movie and people were going to be like getting killed in this house and it was going to be really sweet,-2
And I always like it had been a movie in the back of my head that I'd been wanting to rent or buy for a long time,-1
"And I rent movies online and I put, {laugh} put it in my list and sure enough I get it and it is nothing like that",0
It's like an old stool like (umm) you know like a murder theme mystery in someone's house,0
"(umm) with like British accent people, English accents",-1
"And (umm) I don't know, I, it definitely seemed more like a B film to me",1
I wasn't too impressed,1
"(umm) Even like the cover like makes you think it's gonna be like some xxx nation like wrong turn, I don't know some sort of horror movie or something",-1
And this really wasn't,-1
"I wasn't too impressed I hardly watched any of it and (umm) I was kind of let down, (umm) I thought the original previews in two thousand really led me astray and then I rewatched (umm) one on the internet (umm) today right, (uhh) right as I was watching it and it {laugh} seemed a lot different so I don't know maybe there's another Gosford Park out there but this Gosford Park is sure not (umm) a horror movie, so (uhh) don't rent it",-1
If you're looking for a horror movie,-2
"Is it still a buyer�s market today in Washington DC? As experts in the Washington DC real estate market, we get asked this question a lot, and the answer isn�t as simple as yes or no",1
,0
I�m Brad Chandler from Express Homebuyers and I would like to talk with you about the real estate market in Washington DC,1
"The market really depends on the property type and location because while single-family homes, in great locations that are priced well, have been flying off the shelves, there are other areas that are a bit slower",-1
To better explain - I would like to talk about some different factors that play a role in the market,1
"First of all, buyers are often looking for the same thing , which is good neighborhoods, access to transportation and shopping, good schools, and being close to work, to name a few",1
Properties that deliver all these conditions are definitely a hot commodity and sellers with a highly desirable property are in control of the market,1
"Secondly, investment properties are in demand",2
The massive amounts of foreign cash flooding into the US to invest in real estate has impacted the Washington DC area in unique ways,1
"Overall, those people in a position to pay cash for properties have been picking up the good deals in the marketplace",1
"Lots of sellers are trying out speculative prices just to see if anyone bites, but most investors are walking away from deals that don�t pencil out",1
"Thirdly, financing is still a major obstacle for buyers",1
"Banks are still being strict, requiring money down and even changing their terms at the last minute",1
"It�s not uncommon for approved buyers to get their loans denied right before their closing, although it�s getting better than it was just a couple of years ago as credit standards have begun loosening somewhat again",1
"In general, the markets remain strong",1
"If you are trying to decide whether or not to sell your house, we can help you",1
"There�s a lot of shakeup in the US economy still taking place with the markets moving fast and in lots of directions at once, but we�re investing in the Washington DC area because we believe in the community and the people here",1

Some people number all the boxes,0
The order you number candidates is important and will impact on which candidates are elected,-1
Candidates win by reaching a quota — a certain number of votes,1
The quota is based on the overall number of votes and is different for each region,0
"In the following examples, we show you how proportional representation works when 3 candidates are elected",0
"For real Legislative Council elections, 5 members are elected",1
Candidate 4 has more votes than the quota and is elected,1
The votes over the quota are called surplus votes,1
These are shared among the remaining candidates,1
"To work out who gets more votes, we can not just look at the ballot papers of the surplus votes",0

"Last night, President Obama gave a speech that did many things including talking about his future economic policies.",1
I want to take a look at some of the suggestions President Obama laid out and what sort of missing in a lot of the press coverage.,1
One of the things that we see the press constantly talking about is this issue of potential nationalization of the banks.,0
Our financial institutions have gotten themselves into so much trouble that maybe the only answer is that the government takes them over.,-1
"But if you look at President Obama's speech last night, he made it clear that that's really not the path he intends on taking.",0
"Instead he discussed the need for potential more funding of banks, but to hold those banks responsible for that length or for the money that they get to try to ensure that they actually lend that money to individuals, to businesses and so on.",-1
"Now, there weren't a whole lot of specifics on how exactly he is going to do that, so I think it would be very interesting to look and keep an eye on what the next phase of bank bailouts are going to be and how specifically is he going to force those banks to lend.",-2
"The second issue that Obama brings up and I think one that needs to be looked at very, very carefully is he talks about creating a new lending fund that is going to ensure that more money will make its way to households to buy automobiles, to fund college education and also to entrepreneurs.",0
It's going to be very interesting to see what exactly does he mean by that.,2
Does he mean potentially that the government is now going to create its own lending facility to compete directly with the commercial banks?,-1
"If so, is that a way to try to force more competition in the banking system, to try to get those banks to start lending?",-1
I think it's going to be very interesting to watch how the details unfold on what exactly he means by this new lending fund.,-1

And it tells the story of some vikings that came to (uhh) America around the Canadian area,-3
"And for some reason they left, and they left behind one of their kids and the kid got picked up by Indians and he was raised by Indians",-2
"Then like twenty years later the vikings come back to to (stutter) take over the land and the kid has, is now a grown up and he's part of the Indian culture and he's going to stop the vikings from taking over the Americas and ruling them and killing them all cause they're very savage people",-2
And they're very big monstrous creatures in the movie,-3
"It's a terrible, this is a terrible movie",-2
I do not recommend you go see this because it's awful,0
"It's full of cliches, it's got a stupid love story in it like everything in theaters now",0
And it's just ridiculous,-1
"(uhh) I wanted the fricking bad guy to die the entire movie, I wanted the good guy to die, I wanted everybody to just die so it would be over and I wouldn't have to listen to it anymore or watch it",0
I was falling asleep half the way and it was ridiculous because (uhh) ticket prices are so expensive so I don't recommend you see this,-1
"If you really, really want to see it rent it with like Netflix or something so you don't have to pay for it",-3
"It's terrible, I don't recommend it",-3
"It's called Pathfinder, so avoid this",-3
It's in theaters,-2
On patient financing here in the office; of course one of the things we try our best to do is get good accurate information on their insurance,1
"If they have dental insurance, we want to get as accurate information as we can so we can estimate things well for them",2
One thing we are constantly talking about with that end of the practice is we don’t want patients to have surprises,1
"We want them to know what to expect, try to give them as good an estimate as we can with their insurance",2
That can be interesting at times dealing with their insurance companies because they’re sometimes a moving target,1
"But we do file folk’s insurance, we estimate what their copay should be and have them pay that at the time of service, but then we have the insurance reimburse us",1
"It’s interesting when it comes to insurance, there are all the time, CE courses, continuing education courses out there of people giving their recommendations",2
"A big thing that was going around a few years ago was, have the patients pay it all up front and let the insurance reimburse them",1
"Well, that’s not real customer service related and there are folks who tried that and found out real quickly that didn’t work so well",1
"So we file the insurance, do the paperwork, and when it comes to what the patient’s portion is, whether they have insurance or not, I mean depending on what they need, sometimes I can it can be more than what you want to write a check for out of your checking account this week",-1
"The primary financing option we use is something called Care Credit, it gives some great interest free options so it’s a great way to break down some bigger expenses that way",-2
"We’re always looking for new things; and we’ve had some other programs like Care Credit, we still use some of them but Care Credit seems to be the one that we get the best approval rating, approval from for patients",0
We’re always looking for new things that we can do to help patients in that area,1
We’re actually looking at an in-office discount plan of some kind especially for our patients without insurance,0
That topic has come up before so that’s something we’re looking at and maybe something we can offer here in the near future,1
"Just one more option for folks to kind of get a little bit of a savings, a little bit of a break on things and plus, it benefits us because folks keep coming to see us that way too",1
The big thing with financial things in the office is we like patients to know what to expect,0
There’s nothing like coming in and thinking you’ve got a hundred dollar thing you’re having done and walk out front and the ladies tell you it’s five hundred dollars,-1
Surprises like that are not good,0
Hey there Expo TV goers,0
"I just witnessed a terrible movie that was called TMNT, or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as they used to call it when it was good",-2
"This is a computer animated version of our beloved turtles and it is nowhere near as good as those great, early nineties, real life Ninja Turtles cheese fests",-2
"This Turtles movie is terrible and it has the worst plot and cliche, collecting orbs and stuff xxx I've ever seen in my life",-3
And there's (uhh) the chick is like has like a staff and she hits people with it,2
And I hated it and animation was pretty terrible,-3
"Looks like a video game cut scene, with the exception of one rain fight which was pretty cool",-1
"(umm) All the catch phrases were there, Splinter was there, he was cool, but I didn't really like it",-1
"So, don't see it",-2
I worked for Coca Cola and the factory's based in North London in Edmonton.,2
The office that I worked in was above the factory and it was my job to be part of the production planning team and we told the factory what to make to meet customer demand.,1
"To begin with, it was just getting used to learning how the factory actually runs and what goes into just like the simple task of making bottled drinks.",1
"It was our job to work with the central  operations, to know what the customer demand was around the UK and in France and then with that, you also have to work with suppliers to make sure you get the right materials in in order to keep the factory running.",2
"What I got from this role was mainly confidence, like the change throughout the year, like when you started, one of the main roles is to go to a meeting every morning where you're talking to the leaders of each Department.",2
"By the end of it, obviously my confidence.",1
"it had increased massively from the start, when you're a bit shy, when you walk in.",2
"Technically I've learned a lot and systems that I'd never even knew existed so to come away with that, to write that on my CV that I've got, is really helpful.",1
"But my main connection was working with the people from head office so there were times when I then went to work in head office with the people there and they allowed me to work within  all the different departments at Coke not just to stay set in the planning department but you got to see, spend like a few days working with each department, so I've seen a massive overview of the whole supply chain world.",1

This can be a really difficult thing for physiotherapists to handle.,0
PT's don't want to embarrass their patients or appear insensitive.,0
"It is important to remember that as the health professional it's up to you to maintain the professional boundaries, even when the behaviour is instigated by the patient.",-1
So what can you do?,-1
The first thing you need to do is identify what is wrong with the behaviour with the patient.,0
"Secondly, you need to tell the patient what it is that you expect from them and any policies you have in your clinic about appropriate behaviour.",-1
And then finally the patient really needs to understand that if they don't change this behaviour there may be consequences.,1
"For example, the consequence may be that if they continue with the inappropriate comments you'll have to discontinue their treatment.",1
"If you are searching for a good investment option, consider betterment.",2
Betterment is a relative new company on the investment market and they're really making a name for themselves pretty quickly.,1
They boast about smarter investment for busy people and they really seem to be able to do that.,2
"shook"" is kind of a burnt burnt coral they called it, and I like that it actually is the color that that they say",2
It really is a burnt coral,1
I like the description of the color,1
"The pictures on Jeffrey Starr's website are really good if you're looking at buying some of the stuff, I recommend going to his website and looking at some of the pictures of it on",2
But it's a great color,3

All about captain John Dunbar and his growing up in the frontier and encountering (uhh) the native American xxx tribe and it's just a fantastic so (uhh) really beautifully filmed,-1
"(uhh) The music is fantastic, the acting is great (uhh), one thing I should mentioned is almost four hours long, it's three hours and what fifty-six minutes long",1
(uhh) It's probably up (stutter) in nineteen ninety-one when this came out,2
Never had a show ever been released this long and I don't think there has been a show since then,3
Lord of the Rings wasn't maybe more than maybe three and a half hours,3
"Very long movie but, (stutter) the time flies by, absolutely fantastic",0
Now it is rated PG thirteen,0
"(uhh) There's some tense scenes in it, some hunting scenes",-1
(uhh) The sexual amount in it is some xxx (uhh) but nothing overt (umm) that I can recall,3
"(umm) So, the PG thirteen rating I think is primary there's some a little bit profanity in it and there's like I said some tense scenes",0
"But absolutely fantastic show, you gotta watch this if you haven't seen it",1
Many campaigns sort of start with one key insight and then evolve to sort of the next platform.,1
So there’s been a lot of talk today about the state of the economy.,0

"So last summer, even going into last spring, we were really seeing kind of the downturn that everybody else was experiencing.",1
"And travel, somebody mentioned it earlier, for many people is incremental.",2
Even business travel.,1
"I mean we were seeing and hearing from customers that, “Hey, I normally go see my clients twice a month, well now I’m only allowed to go see them once a month.” Well, for that consumer, we just lost half their travel budget.",0
"That’s, you know, pretty frightening statistics.",-1
"And then on the leisure side, you know, we all learned a word that is not a friendly word in the airline language, which is a staycation.",-1

LORRAINE TWOHILL: I think engaging with communities is absolutely imperative right now.,1
It's definitely a trend and I think why it's important is this is all about passion.,-1
"So people form a passion around something, a love for something, whether it's a love for a particular type of food product, or a game, or a sport, or whatever it is, or character, or music.",1
"They form a passion, they form a community around something that there is a commonality in.",2
"I think the University of Manchester has a lot to offer a prospective PhD student, there's an awful lot of support, like I mentioned earlier, the Speed PhD course was really good at introducing the PhD and on the whole the training that you're offered and support in that way is really good.",2
"All kinds of things from communication to more specific research skills, data-handling, things like that (and statistics) are really well trained and if you want that training, it's there for you to take.",1
I really enjoyed that.,2
There's some films that are really comical and just rather funny without meaning to be,2
One such film is Reign of Fire,0
This film {clears throat} is about a dragon even though there's about eight seconds total of dragon in the entire film,-1
A dragon population that takes over the world,-1
It's set in England (umm) and it's mainly in a castle where a few survivors live and just scratch on day by day,0
"They don't really live, it's just survive",0
"(umm) {clears throat} The scene takes a twist with Matthew McConaughey, I'm sorry, Matthew Slab of Beef McConaughey enters the (uhh) scene as a (uhh) US (uhh) military man that is trying to combat the dragons",0
He's developed a plan to destroy them and he is relying on the inhabitants of the castle to help carry it out,-1
"{clears throat} The acting is over the top, shoddy, hilariously done even though it's not meant to be",1
As far as a serious film? Do not rent this,-2
But if you're looking for something to make fun of (uhh) I would definitely (umm) definitely pick this up just to sit around and poke fun of,-3
"Martin Luther King ""We must meet hate with love"" Martin Luther King Jr.",1
was one of America's greatest leaders.,0

"In the first half of the 1900's in the American South, African Americans suffered terribly under white men's laws.",-2
"King loved his country, but he hated these laws.",1
He wanted an end to the laws that were wrong.,2
He wanted an end to segregation in the South.,1
His dream was for black people and white people to live together peacefully.,1
"""All men are equal."" he said.",1
If you ever wanna make an action movie with (uhh) five dollars for the plot and for (uhh) the props and everything,-3

Phone Booth,-3
"(umm) Has good names in it, I mean there's Colin Farrell, There's Forest Whitaker and Kiefer Sutherland (umm) good old Jack Bauer's son",-3
"But, the whole story takes place inside of a phone booth",-2
"You can change the angles all you want but, come on",-2
This is really boring,0
(umm) Action (stutter) movies usually have action in them,1
"So it makes no sense to have it stand in the same spot for too long (umm) how long is it, two hours",0
I think it's nearly two hours could be wrong on that,1
(umm) Basically it was just terrible,-2
(umm) I I (stutter) would never watch this again,-2
There's very few movies I would say I'd never watch again and this is one of them,-2
It's up there with Mars Attacks for its annoying factor and the fact that it never moves,-2
"But I mean there's, there's (stutter) got some twists in it that's every action movie has that",-1
(umm) Well any good one,0
I want to talk to you about and ultra huge no no when it comes to using humor.,-1

But their very support of such characters could lead to a decline in women’s social status,-1

"And Madison had another friend, let's say her name was Jasmine, and I really did not like Jasmine",-2
She was really mean and just not a very good person in general and I didn't understand why Madison hung out with her all the time,-2
"But because I liked hanging out with Madison, I dealt with Jasmine",-1

"(umm) This is really a kind of a thriller, it's (umm) it's on the fence between (umm) a gangster movie and a lesbian love story",3
(umm) Bound keeps me in suspense every time I watched it and I've seen it about a million times now,1
Maybe that's an exaggeration,0
But I've I've (stutter) watched it a lot,2
I've definitely (umm) made it so this film has paid for itself over and over again,0
"(umm) This isn't going to be a film that you can watch with your children, (umm) it's probably going to be something that you can watch on a date or (umm) with friends",3
And (umm) on the scale of one to ten,1
"I'm sorry, on the scale of one to five I would give this a five",1
(umm) If it were a scale of one to ten I'd give it a ten {laugh} definitely,2

"I just felt like all the jokes were not that funny, (umm) and there were some funny parts but really not, not (stutter) really",-3
"And (umm) the acting was okay, but overall the plot was pretty bad",-2
I just felt like we were going nowhere and basically I just really wanted it to end {laugh} so overall I would not recommend this movie,-3
"Hey, (uhh) this is a review of Are We Done Yet which is a (uhh) (uhh) abysmal movie starring (uhh) ice cube",-3
It was (uhh) it was a pain to sit through really it was it was kinda a mystery that it was was made you know,-1

"Hello everyone, and welcome to michelfalcon",1
"com, a customer experience video blog to grow your profits and people",2
"I'm Michel Falcon, and this is episode number one",0
"In this episode, I'm going to tell you the difference between customer experience, customer service, and customer centricity",2
I'll see you in a moment,1
"A question that I'm asked very frequently is, ""what is the difference between customer experience, customer service, and customer centricity?"" Let's start off by explaining what customer experience is: customer experience is a collection of events that your customers experience or goes through when doing business with you from beginning to end",1
Let's take going to the movie theaters as an example,1
"If you want to go see a movie, the experience often goes like this",1
"You jump online; you select the movie that you want to see at the right location, at the right time",2
"When you arrive at the theater, you purchase your ticket through an employee, or perhaps there's a self-serve option",1
You have your ticket validated,1
"Then you move on perhaps to the bathroom or the concession stand, move into the theater, watch your movie, and then you leave",1
Every single one of those events makes up the entire customer experience,1
"Each one of those events can also be known as a customer touch point, and the entire customer experience can also be known as a customer corridor",1
"Now, that employee that sold you that bag of popcorn was giving you customer service",1
Customer service is simply an action within the entire customer experience,1
Organizations who are known for delivering an amazing customer experience from beginning to end ensure that their customer service at every single touch point is exceptional,1
Customer centricity is a belief,3
It is a belief that an organization operates behind the viewpoint of the customer,1
Let me give you an example,1
"Have you ever been in a meeting where a colleague has said, ""I think we should be doing this",2
""" And then the next colleague says, ""No, I think we should be doing this",1
""" Those are signs of an organization that is not customer centric because their internal people, their employees, are speaking on behalf of the customer",2
A customer-centric organization speaks like this: Our customers are telling us we need to do more of this or less of that,1
"Let's build the right strategies or programs to increase customer loyalty, and let's take what our customers are saying and include their feedback",3
That is how a customer-centric organization operates,0
"If you don't believe in the customer-centric model, let's take a look at Amazon",0
Amazon is a company that is a hundred-billion-dollar market capitalization,0
"Their slogan, their mantra is to be the world's most customer-centric company",1
"Now, you're not gonna debate the financial success of Amazon with me, are you? Thank you so much for watching this episode",1
"If you haven't done so, download my e-book, The 28 Traits of Organizations Who Are Customer Experience Titans",1
"We're talking about presentation, and the next thing that we want to look at when we're evaluating a speaker is: Was he or she enthusiastic?",1
"MR TONER: Today that the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia convicted Radovan Karadzic of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.",2

"This is Patrick Munro, financial adviser, remarking on our home equity lines of credit being lowered.",0
"My hope for the Promise Neighborhood Initiative is that we are able to pull together the key opportunities that all young people need in order to grow up healthy, happily, put together a life where they can really contribute and give back to their community.",2
And there have been lots of people that have been working on providing those kinds of opportunities in our Promise Neighborhood area for many years.,2
"I think this is really a chance for us to go beyond a bunch of silos, a bunch of individual efforts, and really link together the Promise Neighborhood area into one concerted effort where folks don't fall through the cracks at different places, where you can start with young people in their pre-school age and follow them through with really good strong programming opportunities all the way to adulthood.",1
"And the folks that are doing those things are working together as partners, holding each other accountable for results and outcomes and when they do that ultimately kids are not going to be getting a little of something over here, a little something over here, a little something over here, nothing during this period of their lives, but rather for all 7,000 kids that are in the Promise Neighborhood area that they are going to get something consistent that they need to be the adults that we want all our children to be.",2
"So that is what I hope will come out of the Promise nNeighborhood and it's not going to be something that's going to happen in the first six months or the first year, maybe not even the first six years, it's going to be something we keep working on over time.",1

It was a program called Oasis,1

Congress can use YouTube to make your government better?,1

Greetings fellow stamp collectors! Welcome to the Monday Morning Brief for November 21,2
"On October 29, the American Philatelic Research Library in Bellefonte, Pa",2
", officially opened its doors to the world",1
"This splendid facility is housed in the American Philatelic Center, which also is home to the American Philatelic Society",1
"The day before this important event, the APC played host to another gathering of consequence: the Summit on the Future of Philately",1
"Included among the more than 30 participants were representatives from the APS and APRL, the American Stamp Dealers Association, the Boston 2026 World Stamp Show, the National Postal Museum, the Royal Philatelic Society London, and the U",2
,1
"Postal Service, among others",0
"As Linn’s associate editor Michael Baadke reports in our November 28 issue, attendees “enthusiastically discussed the topics of growing the hobby, the future of stamp shows, and dealers and philatelic partnerships, along with ways the leading organizations involved in the stamp hobby can work together to make it succeed and grow",2
"” Throughout the discussion, which often took the form of a brainstorming session, Scott English, executive director of the APS, guided the conversation with his own upbeat observations regarding the state of our beloved hobby",0
"He was quick to point out that the hobby itself is doing well, while organized philately — which includes stamp shows, the APS and other hobby groups — presents what he called “a different story",1
"” An action plan put together by summit attendees called for a presentation at the next APS winter show, to be held March 3-5 in Reno, Nevada",1
"If you wish to offer your own ideas and suggestions for consideration, please send them via email to future@stamps",1

"Frank will co-lead it with Peggy Brown from the Mental Health Commission, there will be representatives from PHNs but, in particular, from throughout the mental health sector - and this will take the form of redoing the guidelines but then overviewing each of the 31 PHNs - doing intensive work on their individual commissioning to make sure, wherever possible, we are building on existing services rather than simply creating or destroying and recreating, and that, I think, is a very important initiative",1

I'm a business professor whose ambition has been to help people learn to lead,0
"But recently, I've discovered that what many of us think of as great leadership does not work when it comes to leading innovation",1

I use the methods of anthropology to understand the questions in which I'm interested,0
"So along with three co-conspirators, I spent nearly a decade observing up close and personal exceptional leaders of innovation",1
"We studied 16 men and women, located in seven countries across the globe, working in 12 different industries",1
"In total, we spent hundreds of hours on the ground, on-site, watching these leaders in action",0
We ended up with pages and pages and pages of field notes that we analyzed and looked for patterns in what our leaders did,0

There was a study done that shows 80 percent of your pitching velocity comes from hip to shoulder separation,1
But before we get into that let's talk about the arm path and hand separation ok,0
Your hands want to separate down low here and you want to break them at an angle 45 degrees or more,1
"So if I'm pitching straight to you and I break my hands, I want to be 45 degrees, not straight to you, 45 degrees or more closed ok because this puts me in a good spot and the back arm is going to be the same back this way not straight back we're going back this way ok",1
"Because if I do that, that puts me into a good spot when I get into my thoracic extension or scap load",1

One of the things that we're getting asked a lot now is what is programmatic advertising?,0

"My name is Julie Asti I'm a Certified Financial Planner with Asti Financial Management, and I'm going to talk today about how to set up a Trust.",0
"Before I talk about how to set up a Trust, it's important to know that there are two different types of really common state planning documents.",-1
There's a living will and there's also a Living Trust.,1
"A living will is a document that comes in to action in a sense, upon your death.",1
"This is Ron Paul with your weekly update for Faced with continuing economic decline and an impending election, the administration, predictably, is entertaining the idea of another stimulus package.",-2
"To explain why the last one didn't work, adherents to the Keynesian economic philosophy are claiming that they actually did work – it just looks like they didn't because we don't realize how much worse off we would be right now without trillions of dollars of public spending.",-1
"The last administration bought into Keynesianism just as much as this one does, unfortunately.",-1
"Until we have leaders who understand that debt is not the way to prosperity, there will be no stopping runaway government spending.",1
"While it is nice to hear about business tax breaks, the positive results of these tax cuts will be dwarfed by its negative effects.",-2
"First of all, $200 billion or so in temporary tax cuts and credits to businesses are nothing compared to the $3.8 trillion in tax hikes that will hit the economy like a ton of bricks on January 1, 2011 if the Bush tax cuts are not extended by Congress.",-2
"Second of all, businesses are reluctant to hire and invest, not because they are looking for temporary credits, but because of future uncertainty; they simply don't know what the government is going to do next and how future government policies will affect decisions they make now.",-2
What new costs and regulations will be placed on them with healthcare reform and financial services reform?,-1
Will Congress convene a lame-duck session this winter to pass cap-and-trade and other destructive legislation?,-1
"What will the cost of compliance be for hiring new employees, and will that force them to simply lay off anyone they hire now?",-1
"Worse, will the government come up with fines or additional costs if businesses have to lay people off in the future?",-2
"Right now, the safest thing for businesses to do is nothing.",-1
"Until we regain respect for the rule of law and remove some of this uncertainty, I'm afraid none of these temporary promises, made right before an election, will do much towards any economic improvement.",0
"The other glaring problem with this proposed stimulus package is that it couples tax cuts with spending increases, which makes no sense when we are already heavily indebted to foreign countries.",-2
We should be cutting taxes and slashing government spending dramatically.,-1
The private sector simply cannot bear the burden of our engorged public sector.,-2
"In fact, one reason earlier stimulus programs did not result in any private sector growth is because large amounts went to the public sector.",0
"Indeed, the spending that the administration is now proposing arguably constitutes a bailout of the public sector and various union allies of the administration.",-1
"This administration is falling into the same dangerous trap we fell into during the Great Depression, as did the Germans leading into their hyperinflation of the 1920's.",-2
Innovation in marketing means understanding what the customer wants and delivering it as quickly as possible.,0
"We don't have a grey parrot here today but this little conure here has been taught to talk, can talk when he wants to.",1

"until she slid the red button, the cute doggie popped out, and she squealed with delight",2
"So: three toddlers with identical plastic toys, but with very different reactions to failure",1
The first two toddlers were perfectly capable of sliding a red button,0
The only thing that prevented them from succeeding was that their mind tricked them into believing they could not,1
"Now, adults get tricked this way as well, all the time",-1
"In fact, we all have a default set of feelings and beliefs that gets triggered whenever we encounter frustrations and setbacks",1
Are you aware of how your mind reacts to failure,0
"And once her powers sort of reveal themselves to the rest of her family, they realize that she might actually be the most powerful witch that's ever shown up in multiple generations",-2
The problem is is that Alex doesn't like magic,-1
"She's had a lot of really bad experiences with her family, people who have died because of their magic, people who have just like left them because of their magic",0
So she doesn't want it and she wants to do whatever she can to get rid of it,-1
In this section we're going to discuss some methods you can use in dealing with tough customers.,1
I'm Pamela Unruh on behalf of Expert Village.,-1
"A very important thing to remember when you are dealing with a tough customer and this is a very difficult thing to do, stay calm.",-1
something they take very seriously and that really set her apart from the rest of the group,2
What you really want to do is keep your answers about them and how well the two of you can work together,1
Make sure you do research on the company before you go in for the interview,2
Take a look around at their website and see if they won any awards maybe for how they treat their employees or how they treat their customers,1
"These are things you can mention specifically when answering that question that can really show that you take your job search seriously and really want this job ""I've been a fan of Build-A-Bear for years now and I think this is a great place for me to put my customer service skills to work In fact, I saw on your website that you won an award for being a great place to work and every time I've been in there I've seen how happy your employees were",2
I would love to join the team,3
"So the three things to answer this question really well are: First, talk about how much you admire the company",2
"Second, talk about what a great fit you would be in this position",2

"Hi, this is Laura Turner, and today I'm going to talk with you about how to write a retail resume.",1
What you're going to want to do first of course is you have lots of retail experience you're going to want to put your most recent and most impressive experience first.,1
"And specifically the experience that you have in retail jobs and really, just make sure that you get everything down there as far as what your responsibilities were in that particular store.",0
"So not only list your position in the store, but also everything that you did with the store.",0
"You know, did you perform audits, did you take out deposits.",1
"Say a couple of the key trends that we’re seeing in marketing for education space has been pretty much what a lot of people are trying to do, which is experimentation and experimentation and mediums that are not necessarily proven.",1
"And so for example if we looked at social media, things like Twitter, you know, how do we measure a return on our investment if it’s not necessarily directly related to lead generation activities, which is very common for the education space on line.",0
So it’s-- experimentation is really a big one.,1
The second one is just staying above the noise.,0
"I mean our target audience, which is young adults, you know, primary 18 to 24 year olds, you know, they’re interacting with quite a few mediums all at the same time, you know?",0
When you are buying an investment property and you're looking for a mortgage it's important to know whether or not lenders will take rental income into account.,2
"Rental income if taking into account, can add to your serviceability of that property significantly.",1
You're renting a property for four hundred or five hundred dollars per week then you're looking at about twenty-five thousand dollars per year almost that you are adding in serviceability if the lender will take that into account.,1
So will lenders take rental income into account?,1
"The answer is yes, some lenders will take rental income into account.",0
I'm sure there are some lenders out there who won�t touch it and who won't take it into account but in most circumstances lenders will take a portion of rental income into account.,1
"There's one lender at the moment which I think is just Bankwest who don't take rental income into account, they take rental yield into account.",2
"So that will just give you an average rental yield of maybe 3 or 4 %, something pretty low and they'll just say �we don't care what the property is renting for we're going to say it's going to for the 3 % yield and here is what will allocate to you.",-1
So they do that but most other people will look at the rent and will take either a portion or the full amount.,1
"I first heard about Sudan when I was in the cafeteria with a few of my friends at Swarthmore College, and there was a newspaper and there was an article about Darfur.",-2

We cannot do this without you,-1

There is NO WAY you can be in right relationship with Jesus AND have other lovers.,1
"Unless you COME OUT from those relationships and be separate, and be holy before Jesus, you will NOT be pure and right with Jesus, but you will be associated with their sin.",-2
"You must come out and be separate, start following Jesus and get into an exclusive relationship with Him.",-3
"Alright, so let's talk for a minute about tips on becoming a motivational speaker.",1
I think again as I said before that I still am becoming a motivational speaker and I'm always watching others and I'm seeing how they command a room.,1
"And what comes out of their mouth and how does it comes out of their mouth, but I think step one in becoming one again I had spoken about it earlier that you have to have a desire that exceeds your, your obstacles that are in your way.",0
"Now if your always, no matter what you've set out to do there are going to be obstacles that keep you from doing it, certainly that's the case for being a motivational speaker.",1
And I think that I don't personally let any of the obstacles get in my way.,1
I keep finding ways to get around them.,1
And I'd say that probably your biggest tip first as I said is desire and commitment to do it no matter what.,1

My name is Christine Marquette and I'm a registered and licensed dietitian with the Austin Regional Clinic and I'm going to talk to you about how long a person can live without water.,1
"This is actually very dependent on two things: weather conditions, and the person's percentage of body fat.",0
"The more body fat a person has, the less bodied water that they have, so if somebody has a very high percentage of body fat, they're actually going to become dehydrated much more quickly than somebody that has a higher percentage of body water.",0
"As far as these conditions, the climate also has a huge impact.",-1
"If you were say, out in the desert.",0

"Google, LinkedIn, all those founders got rejected dozens and dozens of times before they got their first investment.",-1
"So if you get rejected, good news!",0
These critics argue that the welfare state breeds dependence and incompetence among those who receive it,-1
"They argue that it creates social pathologies such as single parent families, excess fertility, and laziness",-1
Some argue that people who receive welfare benefits cannot spend their benefits rationally,1
"And so people who take on this kind of argument will argue that, you know, certain expenditures in food stamps, for example, soda or ice cream, things like that should not be purchased using food stamps because they're unhealthy",0
"I think the whole question that Anita was asking is about chance and how we can assure that girls like Anita and many, many, many other girls in developing countries would have the chance.",1
More access to education and making their lives better and therefore the whole economy better as well as reducing poverty.,-1
Providing that chance means partly breaking down cultural values and traditions about the fact that girls are measured in terms of their success in life by getting married and having children.,1
Girls need to have access to education.,-2
They need to be able to continue their education.,0
"Hi there, Eric Bakker, naturopath with another frequently asked question regarding Candida yeast infections.",1
Is it better to see a doctor for a yeast infection or to get over-the-counter medications?,0
That's a good question.,1
"That really depends on how chronic or severe your condition is and whether you've had it before, if it's recurring, if it's acute, there are many considerations here.",-2
"If it's acute and you haven't really had it before, you can try some home remedies or some over-the-counter treatments.",-1
"If it's chronic and recurring, you're best to get checked out and make sure that you get a resolution of this problem before it gets out of hand.",0
"You don't want to have a chronic condition recurring, try home treatment, and just drive it further into the body.",0
"I've seen many women with acute thrush issues, home treat, go to the doctor, get chronic treatment, then go back and home treat and end up with conditions like endometriosis, which I find quite often linked up with chronic recurring thrush.",-1
"So you can treat at home, but if there's no resolution, you need to get checked out and a proper diagnosis before you can consider proper treatment.",1

What is direct marketing.,2

"They ask employers the most important skills they're seeking in new hires, and communication is number one every year since 1982 and it's evolved",1
Now it's about storytelling,1
"They need people who can convey data, they need people who can tell stories mainly because we are inundated with information, with the emails, you get the radio going, a podcast is going, to videos going",-1
How in the world do you cut through? How does our student cut through? They cut through by being a great storyteller,-1
"The key to a -- to a great communicator is understanding the audience, of being very audience-centered",2
So few people do that,2
"It's about one percent of the people out there do it, and that's what makes them so great",1
They get the audience and so they're situational communicators,0
"They don't talk to the grandmother the way they would talk in a sales pitch, for example, or the way they talk to the mechanic who's fixing their car, and so first of all understanding the audience is number one",0
"You know, back in the day, in TV -- if you watch local TV -- and the lead of the story would be the who, what, where, when, why, and how",0
"You know, the White House says today oil prices may increase over the next quarter",1
"Okay now, instead we hook the audience, and the lead is you may be paying more at the gas pump next month",1
That's how we hook them and that's what storytellers have to do,2
Understand the audience and make the story compelling by hooking them,1
"First thing we do is explain: it's the message, it's not the medium",3
I think sometimes people get really caught up in that,3
"They think oh I've got to do my LinkedIn video, I've got to do something on Twitter, I have to do a class presentation",2
"The main thing to understand is what is the story you want to tell? First get the elements of that, refine that",2
"Get that to where you're not only hooking the the audience but really engaging with them and then focus on -- on the medium that's really the first step we do, but we take them through a process of writing out what it is you want to say and how you make it more compelling",2
"There are just steps and whether it's a personal story, corporate story, group story, that formula it can really work and after we run them through that a few times then they start to get it",1
But we also show some examples,3
There are some fantastic examples of great storytelling out there,1
My favorite is Dollar Shave Club,1
"I just go to YouTube and check out the Dollar Shave Club video made for four thousand dollars and look where -- look where it's gone, but there are many out there that are really compelling so we show them those, run them through the formula",0
You put the two together and they're able to go to put together a pretty good story,1
"Like good communication, stories are situational so we definitely use a lot of different media",1
We do a weekly podcast over at the business school where we interview CEOs and business leaders,0
"We actually pull some of those out and say we're having you listen to this -- not actually what he's talking about earnings -- but how he tells the story about earnings and they're in awe, ""Wow, that is -- that is so compelling"" and what they see is a great communicator and a great storyteller stands above all the rest, but we also show them video",2
"That's a very different concept if you're going to have the video elements, face-to-face, standing up in front of a group",2
WE CAN PROVE IT,0

"My name is Najla abou hamzeh, I am 62 years old and mother of 2 kids.",1
"I knew about the women in technology program and it attracted me a lot because I work for Women’s cause since 30 years and I want to increase my knowledge:  for me the more a woman learns the better In addition, I would like to thank the organizations that offered us such a valuable program: Women in Technology program, Abadieh scouts center, MEPI, Microsoft and IIE.",1
For me they offer a valuable opportunity for every woman it opens her horizons in all fields  societal and financial ones.,0
Now she can let the whole world know what she thinks and does she can share her opinions and make her voice count.,1
Q: Tell us about your experience?,0
I didn’t know anything about computers and I had a friend in Sweden who contacted me asking for my help  because they are doing a handcrafts exhibition and they know that abadieh is very rich in this area.,-1
I asked help from my son Houssam Bou Hamzeh  because I did not know anything about internet  and I asked him to take pictures of the handcraft work of many women in abadieh.,0

"Well one of the things our office did right as we started was to do a lot of research with historians outside of government who could talk to us about the timeline of American presidents’ diplomacy, Islam, where along the trajectory are we seeing presidents talk about the importance of Islam in America and how does that fit it.",1
"And it is important to understand the American narrative as a whole, to understand the different immigrant groups that have come in, the different religious groups that have come in and how it has made our nation powerful, why it is and how it is Americans celebrate diversity.",2
Why is pluralism important to us?,3
Why freedom of expression is important to us?,3
Why is it that in American in 2012 synagogues and mosques and churches are side by side?,1
"And why it is in America that we honor and respect the right of our citizens to dress as they wish in any way that they wish so that a Jew can wear a yarmulke or a Sikh can wear a turban, or a Muslim could wear a headscarf or anybody can dress in any way that they want.",2
"You go back to the founding fathers, you go back to the founding documents of our country, and over the course of this work that we have done on developing this timeline, we’ve seen our founding fathers, from George Washington up until our current president, have inserted the importance of many religions in America, who have talked specifically about the role of Islam in America, who have understood that Islam came to America with the slaves and has been part of our country since the very beginning, which is why you can look at the experiment that is America, with every nation on earth represented in this country, and see the diversity of Islam in America.",1

"The project took on the task to empower the Roma families, or to be precise the population of children up to the age of five.",0
This is very important for the Roma community because empowering the families that are the foundation of society helps you get better results for the future and specifically their inclusion in the system itself.,0
"The project mainly supports mothers who were engaged in the system and thereby received support from all civic institutions, ambulance, hospitals, police administration and educational institutions, which also cooperated in the project.",0
They also showed that the intersectional collaboration is very important and therefore the project was set apart from the other projects and made the representative of the Roma community really feel the benefits of the project.,-1

"In early 2010, relator, Frank Smith approached my prior firm with another lawsuit and at that time, he also raised concerns about an issue that was happening in his work and something that was happening at Astellas, the pharmaceutical company for which he worked.",-2
"Particularly, he was a sales representative for this company and he was selling a drug, Mycamine, that was not FDA approved for use in children.",-1
"What he was instructed to do by the company was sell the drug to children's hospitals, specifically for use in pediatric patients, something that was not FDA approved.",-2
"The company instructed the relator and other sales representatives to hand pediatric studies out to doctors to support use of the drug in children, however, at the same time the company never sought FDA approval for use in children.",3
So the company wanted it both ways.,-2
"The company wanted to....Astellas wanted to increase sales by promoting this drug for use in pediatric patients, but not spend the money to do the adequate studies to make sure that use in kids was safe.",-1
"A lot of times, when a whistleblower comes forward with information, like the relator did in this case, he's, you know, policing the industry.",-2
"Some companies, Astellas in this case, was arming its sales representatives with a calculator to go in and show hospital administrators how much money they would save by buying this particular drug over its competitor that was pricier, but did have an FDA approval for use in children.",-1
That's pretty egregious.,1
"The first and most obvious of all of the pricing strategies, is simply to have a paid apper game.",0
"This generally appears like it's going to be a minimum amount of revenue that you'll obtain, but the outcome isn't always as clear.",0
"When you're deciding to do a paid app or a paid game, make sure that the quality is extremely high because people are going to expect this for this type of an app.",0
"If you're just testing out your MVP, the minimum viable product, and you don't necessarily know where it lies on the quality spectrum.",1
Then you might want to choose a different modulation method.,1
"With choosing a paid method, so this is outright paid, it's best to look at all of the different types of similarly paid apps or games to determine the best pricing strategy.",0
This might vary from country to country or from time of year.,0
"For instance, if you want to get a lot of users very quickly and you're not too worried about the return during the holidays, you might want to lower a price point.",1
"If it's during the summer and you don't really see like a huge rush, maybe it's a better idea to price it a bit more.",1
"Of course, having a paid app or game doesn't mean that you also can't have IAPs.",1

Husband took me to the Nutcracker ballet,-1
"We were all decked out—me in a long red strapless dress, him in a crisp black tuxedo",1
"He took me up on stage after the show, where everybody could see us, which is actually the worst thing you could do to an introvert like me, but I didn’t care quite as much once he got down on one knee and popped the question",2
I could hear people in the audience saying “What did she say,2

"And the evidence is this: that even despite a big downturn in the energy sector, where unfortunately two thousand jobs in Saskatchewan had been lost, our economy actually created 5,200 net new jobs because of the diversity of our economy, because of the strength in agriculture, because of the strength in manufacturing and tech and in mining.",2
"In fact, just last week there was an announcement by a major tech firm in Saskatoon that they’re going to add 300 jobs.",1
"We’re partnering with respect to training for those jobs to happen here in Saskatchewan, so that’s one way that we can encourage more diversification.",1

"My name is Brian Hoyer, and I am a business administration management major at UNI",1
My business is recycle right which has grown into Right Environmental,1
My name is Therese Kuster and my major was public relations at UNI,2
I work at Target Click powered by Mudd Advertising,1
The reason I really got into wanting to start my own business is because I realized the potential for working for myself,1
"I got the idea originally I was involved with the UNI entrepreneurs organization here at UNI, and we are working on a sustainability challenge with a local business and part of that which provide curbside recycling",2
There was no one to provide that service at that time,2
There was all this recycling talk going on so I figured I could provide that service that was obviously in demand,1
Target Click started in the RJ McElroy student business incubator with myself and another partner,2
We provide a variety of online marketing solutions from our clients,2
"It can be anything from paid search to organic search, social media and content production essentially anything that helps them improve the effectiveness up their online presence",2
The student business incubator at the University of Northern Iowa is a learning laboratory designed to educate and inspire student entrepreneurs,1
The goal of the student business incubator first and foremost is to educate them,2
"We want to established a good, strong foundational knowledge for the students before they leave campus on how to start their own business",2
The student business incubator was absolutely crucial in launching our business,2
"From you know accounting help to, providing the actual physical office space that we need, pretty much every aspect has been affected by the incubator",2
But more important than that I think was really the entrepreneurial spirit,2
All of your neighbors are entrepreneurs and if you're stuck on any issue whether specific your business or for client or just anything that you're doing you can walk down the hall and find other people who've probably been through the same thing,1
"To be successful as an Entrepreneur you first of all you need to be passionate, you need to be willing to implement, you need to be willing to take that step forward, I also think you need to be very teachable and be willing to get advice from people when you need it",1
When Target Click first started I'd never considered myself an entrepreneur or in fact I considered myself risk adverse which is not typically a characteristic you see entrepreneurs,-1
So they really helped me grow and move beyond that on a personal level,2
They helped with everything from getting our very first LLC all the way down to negotiating the sale of our business,1
Everything that involves my business has been impacted in a positive way by the incubator,1

"Iran's Supreme Leader, the Ayatollah Khamenei, said on March 21 that the deal does not limit Iran's aggression in any way.",-1

A useful non-digital source of information is witnesses-- finding people who have seen something going on.,1
They saw a co-worker acting peculiar.,-1
Maybe they saw someone walk in the front door that they didn't recognize.,1

"Well, generally speaking, I think they should have that right, however there is a concern about identity.",-1
"If you cover your face completely, will the oath taker be able to reveal themselves to the authorities, now that is obviously a concern.",1
I think that it is essential that anyone taking the oath of Canadian citizenship has to identify themselves to the authorities.,1
"So the question really is, is there a way around it?",0
"Now that's a question that could be addressed by the authorities procedurally, but if that can be overcome?",1
"If the oath taker who is wearing a religious garb, for example an hijab, can properly identify themselves, then they should have the right to do.",0
Welcome to Topic One.,1
"- One of the top questions I consistently get asked is: how do I scale my engagement across social? See, managing large communities or listening all the time, it's time consuming, and we've developed so many time-saving apps and software to help us automate the process, but herein lies the distinction",2
"Processes can be automated, but one-on-one conversations meant to relationship-build cannot",1
The bottom line is that meaningful one-on-one conversations require human-to-human interaction and a personal touch,1
"It's the blending of the two that's an art form, and it's always evolving",-1
"See, when you can automate in the right places, the human touch points within any campaign, product release, or general sharing system, you've hit the jackpot",1
"And to achieve this, we use the rule of thirds to split between automation, sharing, and one-on-one interaction",1
This will make the difference for companies and for people,-1
"I approach it this way for myself, and a word of caution, while great tools do help us automate the process, too much automation of engagement gets us in trouble",-1
"The more complex we get with our automation systems, the harder we have to work at humanizing what we do",-2
"See, unfortunately the science of automation has taught your target audience to distrust most marketing",2
"For instance, when you're doing e-mail triage every morning, do you question whether a particular e-mail is from a real person or is it an e-mail blast that's been personalized to you? Are you suspicious of the ads that you see are even re-targeted? Or do you stop looking at your direct messages on Twitter because all you seem to receive are automated messages? Your audience is just as sick of being bombarded with automation as you are, and in this discussion of automation, let's also consider the human error factor",2
"Currently, there is no automated system that prevents humans from making mistakes or social errors online",-1
"And as companies, we've been used to having a little space between developing content and distributing it",1
"But digital sharing, especially immediacy of social, has made many of us wish there were more filters in place to prevent human mistakes from coming in",1
"So, where should we draw the line? People want us to be more human online, but part of the discomfort many companies have with embracing social business is the possibility of embarrassment due to that human error",2
"See, some of the errors committed online by corporations have been more than just embarrassing",1
They've been career-ending,1
"However, companies are learning to demonstrate humanity rather than knee-jerk reactions to save face",1
That's a good thing,1
"In the corporate world, there's still a little too much emphasis on appearing perfect",0
"People are surprisingly forgiving brands when they own up to mistakes, and unfortunately some haters out there love to point fingers and jump all over imperfections, but for the most part, people understand",1

In my video today I want to give you a few tips on how you can trade stocks intelligently and how I like to do it.,2
"Stocks are always popular assets on the binary option market, Personally, I think that's because of the fact that people recognize brand names and want to trade them, even if you aren't trading actual stocks, you can say ""I traded apple stock today and made a $400 profit!"", that always has a nice ring to it... As with any other asset, the first rule of trading stocks is this - don't trade what you don't know.",1

Thanks for tuning in,1
I’m Peter Robert from ACDelco and I’m here to discuss the timing belt and the importance of having it replaced as preventative maintenance,0
"Because it is not often replaced, timing belt service is easy to overlook when your car is otherwise running well",1
"Unfortunately, there are no warning signs or symptoms of a worn belt",2
It may simply break and the engine will stop running – whether you’re in your driveway or on the freeway,0
"With some engine types, a broken timing belt could also cause severe internal engine damage that could require major engine repair or even a new engine",1
"That’s why it’s very important to check your owner’s manual for the mandatory replacement recommendations starting as early as 40,000 miles, but may be as high as 100,000 miles",1
"For all of you not able to do this service work yourselves, please go to acdelco",-1
com and click on ‘find a service center’ to locate the closest ACDelco professional service center program participant,0
"One of the advantages of going to your local ACDelco professional service center is that we offer timing belt service kits that could save you valuable time, money, and possibly prevent future engine failures",0
"Our kits include all the component parts associated with belt service work: new pulleys, springs, tensioners and perhaps even a new water pump",1
Replacing these wear components when replacing the timing belt is essential to ensuring the new belt performs to its mileage requirements,1
"Replacing these components when changing the timing belt saves money on labor in most cases, as your technician will have already removed them and other engine accessories to service the timing belt",2
"Our kits for GM vehicles match original specifications for the belt material and supporting hardware – and our kits for other non GM vehicles meet or exceed factory specs, too",1
Some competitors’ kits don’t include any original-equipment components,-1
That’s important enough for me to say it again: ACDelco timing belts are manufactured with materials and construction technology identical to the original timing belt in your vehicle,-1
"An inferior timing belt may cost less initially, but may cost more down the road if fails prematurely",-1
Check your owner’s manual today for the recommended timing belt service – and by the way: some engines use a timing chain instead of a belt,1
"In that case, periodic replacement isn’t necessary and there won’t be a mileage recommendation for service",1
"If you’re unsure about your vehicle, ask a representative from your ACDelco professional service center",1

"So I thought, wow, a membership site could solve my problem of being on the road all of the time But it could also solve problems for people at a mass level that I couldn't do if I was speaking seven days a week, so that got me excited too",-1
"Yeah initially I was really worried, wondering if we had enough content",-1
"And Stu kept assuring me, he said, you got tons of content",1
"You know, you've got books, you've got all this content you've done your site",1
"But I kept thinking, oh my gosh, I'm going to have to come up with this original content every single week",1
But that wasn't the case,0
"What I found was that you can really repurpose the same content and it's extremely rare when somebody says, oh that's just that blog post you did a while back",1

The six ships are powered by an alternative fuel blend made of 10% biofuel  and 90% conventional petroleum fuel.,1
"The biofuel is primarily made from beef tallow, which was provided by Midwestern farmers through a partnership with the USDA.",0
The deployment of the Great Green Fleet  is one of the U.S.,2

Let's use some of the creativity we talked about last week for this chapter,1
"I want you to imagine you are really really rich and you can have anything you want to have I want you think about might be a particular car, it might be a race horse it might be a house on the beach",1
Think about a possession that you would like to actually own,1
I want you imagine maybe even close your eyes and imagine that you have that possession,1
"How would you feel and how it would be to have that item in your life and now I want you to imagine how you would take care of that object If it was a car, for example, I know a lot of you have dream cars how would you take care of ti? Would you read the instruction manual? Would you make sure it had tune ups? Would you polish it to perfection and make sure it was always in its prime state",1
Maybe and those of you have children I want you to think about how hard you strive to be the best parent you can be,1
You try to buy healthy food and take care of that child or what about a pet? What did your pet have for breakfast this morning? This chapter is all about health and as you can see what I'm trying to get to here,1
We know that good health is more important than anything,1
It's more important than that race car or that race horse or that magnificent house,1
People who are sick or who don't have good health would give all away to have good health and yet how well do we take care of ourselves? Do we read our instrucion manual? Well we don't come with one but do we read articles about health and how to eat well and take care of our bodies? Do we eat well do we sleep do we do all those things we know we're supposed to do,2
In this chapter a lot of it's very very familiar,0
You probably already know what you're supposed to do so this chapter is a reality check and a reminder that we need to take care of ourselves and that our health is our most prized possession,1
So 2:08review for most of you especially if you've taken the health three-unit health class which isn't required to transfer to a UC and even to transfer to a CSU you have a lot of options in that Area E but if you've taken it again this chapter will be just a good reminder,1
At this point in the semester it's a good time to think about those things we learned about keeping our brains healthy way back in a chapter on memory,1
Remember was it sleep that you needed more? Or healthy vegetables? Or what is it that you need to keep your health your mind and your body healthy,1
So think about it this week and think about getting back on track and making sure as you get busier and busier and as finals approach that you do not dream of neglecting to take care of your most magnificent possession,1
This week you also get a chance to take a little test to see how long you're going to live,0

Uh and that’s certainly what we’re look for in an application process is individuals that have excelled.,1
"Um and so I know there are some programs that may require a basic number of shadowing or volunteer hours um but I really think you should do it because you’re interested in it um and you, you, you want to enhance yourself uh in order to make yourself potentially a better doctor down the road in our case.",1
"Steven Wallace&gt;&gt; My name’s Steve Wallace, I’m the grocery, beers wines and spirits buyer for Sainsbury’s for Scotland and for Northern Ireland.",1
My role is to find the best products we can find in Scotland.,1
"It’s looking for quality products that we can sell or our customers demand, it’s looking for different and exciting ideas within the marketplace.",1
"The best part of the job, I would say, would be when you’re giving a big new contract or a new listing to, in particular, a small supplier because that’s where it means jobs.",1
"You could list a product in 20 or 30 stores, it could mean an extra five or six jobs at that particular supplier, so that’s always a good good moment.",1
"Your decisions in your everyday job, from seeing the quality products to listing them on your shelves, that affects jobs and communities, it goes all the way down the chain.",2
"Sometimes you can underestimate the importance you can have to different suppliers and actually to employment, so it’s absolutely fundamental, it helps the whole Scottish food industry.",2
"My least favourite part of the job is the administration, the spreadsheets and deadlines surrounding the job.",1
"There are great fun parts to the job about seeing great products, great suppliers, but actually there’s a lot of time needs to be spent doing the number crunching analysis, it’s a boring part but it needs to be done, it’s all part of the job.",1
"I think you need to have a good eye for a product, you need to be very patient, you need to be good at communicating because we have to communicate within our retail side and our head office, government bodies, all sorts of suppliers and other people, so being a key communicator is absolutely essential.",1
I got to this position really by working in the retail industry for a long time.,0
"From pushing trollies in Tesco when I was 15, I’ve worked for Tesco’s, for Sainsbury’s, I went to Sainsbury’s as a trainee buyer in London about 12-13 years ago then went to work for Waitrose as a buyer, then took the opportunity to come back up to Scotland (because there aren’t many buying jobs in Scotland) three years ago.",3
The advice I’d give to anyone interested in a career in the food industry is to get involved with the suppliers at an early age – know your products.,1

If you are on Instagram you probably noticed that there has been a pretty good increase on ads lately.,2
That is because earlier this month Instagram began offering paid advertising opportunities through selective developer partners.,2

These new ad opportunities require a minimum spend.,-1

"- Hi, it's Tim Allwood from Compass Property, here today to talk to you about Equity",1
"What's Equity? Equity in your home is when you, well, it's what you own in your home",1
"So if you take off what your home's worth, $500,000, say, if you owe $200,000, that's equity of $300,000, okay? So it's the difference between what you owe and what your house is worth, your equity",1
"The big problem is, a lot of people leave their equity sitting at home all day doing nothing, so to speak, in the cupboard",-1
"While you go and work your butt off, and your equity's sitting there doing nothing",1
"So what we propose you do is what most clever Australians do, is grab some of that equity, keep it secure, don't take all of it, just a good amount of it",1
"So we use that to purchase the income-producing asset, an investment property",1
"So what you need to be clear about is you don't have to spent all your equity, and we can actually take enough equity to make sure there's a nice buffer",0
"So you don't, it's actually no money down for your investment property, we'll talk about that in another video",0
"And I'll also talk in my next video about whether you should be looking at cash flow neutral, cash flow positive, cash flow negative, and in fact, what that really does mean",0

"and buying these electric vehicles, so all those lead to really good signs for this industry, as well as the renewable market is continuing to grow",1
"So solar in a lot of parts of the world now is much cheaper than using fossil fuels, and that's because of the infrastructure needed",1
"Now, in more developed nations like the United States where we have massive amounts of fossil fuel based infrastructure, it's a lot cheaper still",0
"However, as the rest of the world comes online and starts to develop, a lot of these technologies, renewable being one of them, is gonna be the cheaper and better option, and when that happens, the reason that matters for the EV market is because you'll be able to power your vehicles using this free renewable source, whether it be wind or solar or whatever, and it's not just about the consumer side where me and you have cars that we use to go to work and back",0

"It's an engineered product overall There's half inch and three eighths options in terms of thickness 1 mil, 2 mil, 3 mil wear layer depending on what actual style you go with within Reward The longevity of the product will definitely depend on how thick of a wear layer you end up purchasing You're also going to get some good width options",1
"Some products come with 3 and 5 some only have 3, you also have some random width lines in here where you'll get 3, 5, 6 and 7 So there's a lot of different width options you can do which is really good for design Length is pretty average",1
You're going to get 48 inch average length,1
It is random so probably a little big above average in a lot of things you see out there so nothing overly spectacular about the board length,1
"In terms of the finish, it's got a great finish, it has the aluminum oxide finish on it It's always important to keep in mind, whatever finish you buy it's going to scratch So yes this hardwood will scratch but it also has a very nice 25 year warranty on the finish The product itself, the maintenance is very very easy Just like you would maintain any other hardwood floor, you're going to sweep dust mop, wipe up spills and every once in a while you can damp mop Make sure you keep felt pads under furniture, things like that Installation really has a lot of options here",1
"You can nail it, staple, glue, float That means you can pretty much put it in every room in your house Your basement all the way up to your top floor kitchen, bathroom",1
"Definitely don't recommend the bathroom but any common space, this product can be installed there So we kind of gave a basic overview of the design, you have a lot of design options within this line",2
It can be installed pretty much anywhere…very easy to maintain It's a very quality constructive product I think overall this is a great buy,2
This floor itself is a value choice,1
A great overall purchase no matter which one you buy The price and the value always match with Reward Hardwood Flooring This is Donnie with Flooring My Life product reviews,1
"As director of the National Institutes of Health, I'm delighted with the renaming of this part of what we do...a very important part ...as Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI). And the notion that this is something  that we don't just think about now and then, but it's something we think about everyday... EDI 365 ...is also a very important component of what we're talking about with this new perspective.",2
"I guess on Leap Year it would be ""EDI 366"" but, oh well...small point.",1
"The leadership that is in place, and about to be in place, with Deb Chew now taking on the role of creating this new version of the office and with Hanna Valantine, distinguished cardiologist coming from Stanford to be our new Chief Officer for Scientific Workforce Diversity, puts us in a place to emphasize this area of diversity and inclusion in new and creative ways.",1

"Hello, I'm Jessie Quinn from cupsofbooks and today I'm going to be reviewing A Study in Scarlet by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.",-1
"[music] Because I only finished two books in February, I will not be posting Monthly Minis video.",0
Instead you're gonna get two separate videos that are going to have individual reviews for both books I read in February.,1
We have reached the point in my review where I put down whatever I'm drinking and start talking about the book.,2
"So I'm gonna do that To give you the synopsis off the back because I feel it will sum it up  better than I will: [quoting] In A Study in Scarlet, Holmes and Watson's first mystery, the pair are summoned to a south London house where they find a dead man whose contorted face is a twisted mask of horror.",3
"The body is unmarked by violence, but on the wall a mysterious word has been written in blood.",0
"The police are baffled by the circumstances of the crime, but when Sherlock Holmes applies his brilliantly logical mind to the problem, he uncovers a tragic tale of  love and deadly revenge.",-1
Dot dot dot.,2
"Yes, I did just read out the punctuation.",1
Honestly I enjoyed A Study in Scarlet much more as a predecessor to the contemporary mystery novel than as an actual mystery novel.,0
A lot of the sorta hallmarks of your average mystery novel are not really in this one.,1
"For instance, there is really no way of knowing who did it in this one until it's actually revealed by Sherlock Holmes who had committed the crime.",1
"When sherlock reveals who did it, I was sorta like, ""Well, I would have had no idea who that person was!"" One thing I didn't quite expect from this novel is that half of it is told from Dr. John Watson's perspective on what's happening with the crime and Sherlock in London and then the other half is sorta told through flashbacks that are flashbacks from other characters that are associated with the crime.",-1
Really liked all the stuff that was told from Dr. John Watson's perspective.,0
I purchased a purse at a store that had a tag with a price on it and I found out later that they overcharged me what the purchase price was.,-2
"So when I argued with them and argued with my credit card company, they refused to reimburse me for the difference so I made a complaint with the Consumer Affairs.",-2
I did it online.,0
"And within about a month or so, I received a call from the store and they told me that they will refund me the difference.",1
I would tell every New Yorker that there are government agencies like the Department of Consumer Affairs that are out there and are free; that you can use to help you resolve complaints.,0
That you don’t have to go to a lawyer to get your issue resolved.,2

this video we're going to have a brief talk about data exchange formats and more specifically about XML and JSON and why JSON is widely replacing XML nowadays,1
So first of all what data exchange formats are,0
"Data exchange formats are standards that have been developed in order for applications to serve up data and this is what we think of us an application programming interface, an api, an interface that two different applications use in order to talk to each other",0
"For example, one might be a client that wants to talk to a web server",0
How do they talk to each other,1
By sending data back and forth in some standardized way that they both know about such as XML and JSON,0
XML stands for extensible markup language and JSON for javascript object notation,0

This article really emphasizes the importance certainly from a narrative perspective of engaging externalizing conversations in our work.,1
"The article or the lesson then goes on to identified certain what I call fluid practices that ground me in the work, along with an article documenting my work with particular clients suffering from the effects childhood sexual abuse and our work over a period of about nine months.",2

"I also spoke this week about how under the President's failed legacy on drug policies, addiction rates and overdose deaths of opioids has increased dramatically",0

I'm grateful that Congress acted to address the opioid crisis by passing the bipartisan Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act that empowers communities to address the opioid crisis locally,1
I also spoke on the house for this week to urge my colleagues to vote for the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act,1

"7 billion worth of untraceable foreign cash, they put American families of risk of attack",1
"This week I sent a letter to the Acting Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, demanding answers on what steps his office took to ensure that the payment will not be used to support terrorist activities to kill Americans",1
I look forward to continuing to advocate for this legislation when it comes before the full House led by Chairman Ed Royce,1
The Committee on Education and the Workforce met to discuss the Juvenile Justice Reform,2
"I'm grateful to support this legislation of the Supporting Youth Opportunity and Preventing Delinquency Act of 2016, because this legislation provides necessary resources to state and local officials to better serve at risk youth and drug offenders",1

"We kind of look for 640 as kind of a minimum score that we're trying to have in order to get an approval, and obviously, the higher the score, the easier your approval will be",0
"The score is a reflection of how well you pay your bills, what type of credit you use, how many inquiries you have, what are the balances of your credit cards to your maximum limit",1
"So, you want to be very careful about those items",0
"Another general tip is we're looking for three credit items to be open for a minimum of 12 months, so if you don't have any credit, you need to go out and borrow some money to build up your credit history before you go get a mortgage, which is the biggest piece of credit you'll ever get",1

Hi I'm ASIC Commissioner Greg Tanzer.,-2
Today’s Fairfax papers report on bribery allegations against the Reserve Bank of Australia and its note printing subsidiaries - and ASIC’s decision not to take the matter further.,1
The ABC’s Four Corners is doing a story on this tonight.,1
It is important to note the Australian Federal Police has already charged people involved in this and those cases are before the courts.,1
The AFP also asked ASIC to see if directors of these companies breached the Corporations Act.,-1
"Let me be crystal clear: ASIC looked at this matter very closely but, based on the facts, decided not to take the matter further.",0
"What we did do was review more than 10,000 pages of documents including several detailed witness statements.",-1
"As there are related prosecutions before the court, we are not in a position to detail the reasons for our decision, but the public can be completely and utterly confident in what ASIC did.",1

Provided there are no unforseen delays certification could come as early as September.,1
Companies are warned that selling fish that is pending certification requires adding the under assessement fishery to your scope.,0
Hi everyone.,2
It's Alejandra and I want to tell you about  one of my favorite organizing products from The container Store.,1
I  have a list of probably about ten or fifteen different  products that I always use in spaces that I organize.,0
And one of those products are these self-adhesive instant wheels.,1
I discovered these wheels probably about six months ago  when I was just browsing The Container Store and I am so  glad I bought them.,3
I went home and I put them on my  laundry hamper because my hamper is always so heavy to  move from my bedroom to my laundry room.,1
I'm Dr Graham Pike from the Department of Psychology at the OU and I'm a forensic psychologist.,2
Forensic psychology is concerned with all aspects of crime in a criminal investigative procedure.,0
"One thing forensic psychologists have done is look at witness memory, particularly how we can help the police to get the most out of what a witness has seen of a crime.",1
So there are interviewing techniques based on psychological theories of memory that tell police how to go about interviewing a witness.,1
One thing that might happen is that we allow a witness simply to recall everything they can without interrupting them.,0
"Something else we might do is try to mentally reinstate the crime scene to the witness, that is to get them to imagine as if they're back at the crime scene, to think about the weather, the temperature and the smells there.",2
By doing that the witness can remember more accurate information.,0
One of the reasons it's so important to look at witness memory is there's an expectation that our brains act a bit like a computer.,2
and so we worked with OFGEM and the Department of Energy and of Climate… - Department of Energy and Climate Change that administers this,0

"Hey everybody what's up I wanted to do a review of the new Kanye West, Paul McCartney and Rihanna Collaboration Four Five Seconds.",0
It got released about a day or so ago and the twittisphere is exploding with it so lets talk about their new song.,0
Now this is the second collaboration that we know of that Kanye West has done with Paul McCartney.,-1
"They released a song Only One about a month or so ago and we sort of got an insight into how dumb some of Kanye's fans are from the statements they were posting on Twitter asking who Paul McCartney is, saying this Paul McCartney kid is going to go far and that Kanye has a good ear for talent and you know what it is sort of understandable these people who are Kanye fans are a lot younger they probably weren't around when the Beatles were big and you know we live in a day and age now where it's so difficult to find information.",-3
If you have a question where do you go to find information I mean oh wait there is a way to find information it's called Google.,0
"If you have a question about anything you just Google it and you can find so much information at your finger tips, but i guess people choose not to use common sense to do that but anyways getting back to the song.",1
I've always found when big talent superstar collaborate that their is so much expectation of what the song is going to sound like it's never going to meet expectations and this is one of those examples.,-1
I wasn't a fan of Only One I thought it was pretty disappointing to me and this song I didn't have much expectation going in.,-2
"I am a fan of Paul McCartney and Rihanna , but i am not a big Kanye fan, but i do recognize that he is a pretty talented guy.",-1
Now this song does sound in some respects like Only One in terms of how stripped down it is.,0
"There's no drums in the song, this song unlike Only One doesn't sound like there are any keyboards there's no drums and no auto tune and it's basically Paul McCartney playing acoustic guitar and Rihanna and Kanye share vocal duties going back and forth.",0
And Rihanna's vocals are definitely pretty screechy on this song and Kanye has some pretty tuneless singing.,-3
"Kanye has never been the greatest singer in terms of his singing voice and that's probably why he relies so heavily on auto tune, but this song reminds me of that awful collaboration that Michael Jackson did with Paul McCartney.",1

"Now let's talk about organizational pattern, and when I talk about organizational pattern, I'm talking about the order in which you put your information.",-1
"In this module, we're are focusing specifically on spatial data.",1
We start by taking a little bit of a refresher on the three components of the ArcGIS software.,1
Now in Module 1 you were exposed to ArcMap and ArcCatalog.,0
So you should remember that ArcMap is the component--the main component of ArcGIS.,1
"This is where you create your data, edit data, view data, analyze your map, create maps, it is the workhorse of the ArcGIS program.",0
"The second component is ArcCatalog is more focused on database management so you should remember how you search through the different datasets, change projection, added thumbnails, everything like that.",2
"And then the last part, ArcToolbox, the last component is the one we will be exploring towards the end of the course.",0
Where we get into looking at very specific geoprocessing tools.,1
Also in this module we start to really dive into the world of spatial data.,1
Make sure you pay attention to the difference between our two key types of spatial data models vector and raster data.,1
"Make sure you know the difference between the two, but also know how each data model represents the real world in the computer program.",0
So what are the differences?,0
How did the final products look different?,0
And pay attention to where error is introduced and the limitations of both data models.,0
The last part of these lecture slides really dive into those key concepts related to ArcGIS and GIS in general.,1
So pay attention to the key concepts and key terms because they come up throughout the semester and throughout the time that you are exposed to GIS software.,0
"Make sure you understand the difference between layers and features, and shapefiles and feature classes classes, and feature classes and feature datasets.",1
We also talk about the importance of attributes.,0
Attributes are really are what set apart GIS software and just a paper map showing the place.,0
"ArcMap allows us to display these not nonspatial features, for example population of the state, population change...  what else can we display... disease  rates.",1
All of these things can be stored within the shapefile data as an attribute table-- can be displayed.,1
"Now that we've talked about whether your choosing battery powered or hardwired, you've got to determine how and when you're going to use this.",1
The beauty of this is it's totally customizable.,0
You can set your GPS to turn on a Monday through a Friday and not work on the weekends.,1
"You can set it so that it's motion activated  -- The minute you move your car, the GPS turns on.",1
You can also set it so that it's on every minute of every day.,1
"Okay, so you've got your killer introduction.",1
Now we need to talk about the conclusion.,0
"But when they're injured the heal with scar tissue and now they don't glide as much, right, and they create this knot in there",0
"The knot doesn't move very well, it's very restricted, and the body's not sure what's going on so it has nerve endings going down there to figure out what's going on",-1
So it's very easily irritated again,0
"This is soft tissue technique breaks that scar tissue down, and eventually the muscles start to glide and arrange an emotion just in two visits, when does it actually, improve probably twenty or thirty percent right",0
So I'm going to do one more pass,1

"Emotional intelligence, or EQ, has been defined in many ways",1
"For our purposes, I define EQ as ""the ability to process painful emotions in healthy and effective ways",0
""" For example, high EQ might enable you to cope with the pain of losing a job by talking with trusted friends or family, practicing self-care skills, allowing yourself to grieve the loss of the job, and employing problem-solving skills for finding a new job",-1
"Low EQ, on the other hand, might cause you to deal with your pain by drinking or drugging, self-cutting, catastrophizing, beating up on yourself, of falling into hopelessness",1

The human brain is not strictly an organ that develops according to genetics,0
"Infact nothing is, as I gave the example of the seed, I mean if you want that seed to grow you have to plant in the right kind of ground with the right conditions of light, and irrigation, and nutrition",0
Well the human brain also develops in response to the environment especially the human brain because most of our brain growth occurs after birth and not before,1
"About 80 percent happens after birth, and much of that in the first three years of life, so by the end the third year of life the human brain is something like 80 or 90 percent adult size",1
Whereas the human body is about 18 percent adult size,0
So those first three years are hugely important,-1

Our research is designed to  highlight and estimate the economic contribution  of some of the conserved habitats here in the prairie and pothole region.,1
Some of those contributions aren't necessarily all that apparent.,-1
So we want to highlight those impacts and make that link between habitat conditions and social and economic impacts.,0
We feel that that side of the story  doesn’t get told all that often  and it’s a very important piece  to make sound land management decisions.,1
"For wetlands, for instance,   someone might say,  oh there’s not that much economic value to it.",1
But that could pull in a lot of resident  and non-resident hunters every year.,1

Welcome to EPIC conference 2016,1
As Minister of Ethnic Communities I welcome you all – especially those who have travelled from overseas and outside of Auckland,1
This conference is important to raise the visibility and awareness of migrant businesses,1
It is also about enabling local businesses to connect with other businesses both here and abroad,2
First it was a “supercity”,1
,2
We have made it that way – and it’s a good thing,0
"Almost half of the population in Auckland today are Maori, Asian and Pacific peoples and there are over 200 ethnicities represented here",2
"Superdiversity brings with it enormous benefits such as greater innovation, productivity and investment",1
Right here at this conference you have a huge opportunity to unlock the benefits of diversity,1
We have a full range of excellent speakers on the program including our very own Prime Minister the Rt Hon John Key,2
"We have Wei Gao and Sir George Fistonich and they have typical migrant stories of struggle, hard work and success and I know in this conference centre there are many more stories of achievement that will play out going forward",1
"Like Sir George and Wei, we need to harness the energy and innovation that diversity creates to support new business ventures as well as grow existing businesses",1
And you will receive expert insights as to the importance of marketing and customer relations,0
"I am encouraged that you will be making connections, and exchanging ideas that will help us unlock the benefits of diversity for New Zealand in a connected global market",3
"&gt;&gt; Role models are very important for the region, especially in the area of environment because the Middle East is really suffering from very big environmental problems, especially the contribution to the global climate change to the region is quite important.",-3

This meeting was particularly important to the grantees because it moved them in their evaluation thinking from making sure that they had a product or solution that was of good enough integrity to use with patients to thinking much more broadly about the evaluation: How was this going to impact the physician?,1
How was it going to – the content and the use of ODLs – going to be detected in the individual care of a patient?,0
I think that social justice is the foundation of a good society.,0
"It is respect for others, it is fairness, it is the dignity of work, and it is a recognition that we all have to share in the benefits of development and growth.",1
"Unfortunately that’s not the situation today, that’s why we have to fight for it.",1
"Social justice is a way of reacting to a crisis but also of organizing society and the essence of the whole thing is that it is an approach, it’s a system, it is the conviction that certain values have to be there.",-1
Is it possible?,1
This is the history of change; you always have to fight for social justice.,0
"Today it means recognition that one of the best ways to get to social justice is decent work, it is the dignity of work, the dignity of the human being, the stability of the family, the peace in the community that decent work gives you.",1
I think that the essence of the way business has to approach social justice is to understand that it is also good for business.,-2
That productivity and competitiveness leads to a fair distribution of the fruits of labour and this is the essence of the ILO approach.,1
That you have a fair chance at whatever wealth you contributed to creating and every successful enterprise knows that.,1
The ILO has highlighted that there is a link between social justice and a fair globalization; in fact we put together a Declaration on that issue.,1
"The key question is that we have to move from a globalization that is unfair and unbalanced and unsustainable into something that actually people look at and say “hey, I’ve got a fair chance of being part of this”. That is not the situation today.",2
The crisis has made it more difficult and that’s why the struggle for social justice  - because it is a struggle - is so fundamental and so key.,1
And there are many people in the world that understand and believe this and we have to get this into the economic system.,1
The essence of addressing social justice from the perspective of young people is to acknowledge that we have a generational debt to the young people.,2

Do you have student loans that are reporting past late payments on your credit report? Student Loans are the scariest kind of Debt,0
"You can't remove them through bankruptcy and if you don't pay them, they never fall off your credit report",0
My name is Jesse Rodriguez with CreditCEO and I look at Credit Reports every single day,1
"There is a huge problem that I see on hundreds, if not thousands of credit reports and it is student loans reporting past late payments when they were supposed to be in deferment",0
Today I'm going to show you how you can correct student loans that are reporting past late payments on your Credit,-1
Everyone gets in a bind with their student loans for a different reason,-1
There's not always going to be one solution what works for each person,0
"Even if the late payments weren’t because you were in deferment, there is still an option for you without having to pay some company a bunch of money to fix it",1
Option 1 is the student loan late payment forgiveness program,1
"If you have past due lates on your credit from your student loan company, I want you to call the lender and ask them about the student loan late payment forgiveness program",2
"The way that it works is they will set you up on a payment plan, if you’re not already on one",0
"After you make 9 on-time payments to the repayment plan, it will automatically remove all of the past derogatory reporting from those student loans that were included in the forgiveness program",-1
"Now, what if you paid all of your student loans on time, but they’re still reporting late payments? Then, what you need to do is, reach out to us and we will give you a free credit audit and consultation",1
"If you have student loans and you haven't even checked your credit in the last couple months, you could have late payments and not even know about it",-2
"You need to check your credit regularly! If your loan was in deferment but they're reporting late payment, that is a great reason to go in and file a dispute",2
"We can help you with that, so you don't make any mistakes, but you can also do it yourself",2
There's other videos here on our channel that explain what the dispute process is and how you can do it for yourself,0
So I hope this was helpful and I hope that you can get your student loan late payments removed from your credit report,1
You need to make paying your student loans a priority,-1
"If you want to get an FHA loan, they're not going to allow you to get an FHA loan if you have past defaulted student loans",-1
"They never go away, there's not a 7 or 10 year statute of limitations on student loans and you can't include them in bankruptcy",0
"Get out of your student loan debt, kick some serious butt and get motivated to make a change in your life",1
"If you found this video to be helpful please like it, subscribe to our Channel and leave a comment",0
"Hi, I'm Laura from youngwritersworkshop.com, and I'm going to talk about how to write a campaign speech.",1
A campaign speech has to really get someone's attention.,1
"Believe it or not, people don't really want to listen to a long speech most of the time.",-1
And so you really have to do your best to capture the listener's interest in the beginning of the speech by connecting to an issue that's going to be of interest to them and of importance to them.,1
"Now, the development of your speech is going to be a lot like developing an essay.",1
"You need to come up with one or two points, and then continue to support that point in a way that will help it flow, help people understand it.",-1
Deadpan is a form of comic delivery in which humor is presented without a change in emotion or body language.,0
"It is usually spoken in a casual, monotone, or cantankerous voice, and expresses a calm, sincere, or grave demeanor, often in spite of the ridiculousness of the subject matter.",0
"This delivery is also called dry humor or dry wit, when the intent, but not the presentation, is humorous, blunt, oblique, sarcastic, laconic, or apparently unintentional.",0
"Etymology The term deadpan first emerged as an adjective or adverb in the 1920s, as a compound word combining ""dead"" and ""pan"". The oldest usage recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary comes from The New York Times, which defines the term as ""playing a rôle with expressionless face"". An example of this usage is in a scene from the 1934 film The Gay Bride in which a gangster tells a man on the other end of a phone conversation to ""give it a dead pan"", so that the man does not inadvertently alert anyone else in the room as to the importance of what the gangster is about to say.",-1
"The usage of deadpan as a verb is recorded at least as far back as 1942. Examples Many popular American sitcoms use deadpan expressions to deliver dry humor, most notably Curb Your Enthusiasm, Arrested Development, The Office, Red vs.",0
Blue and Seinfeld.,0
"Some good current examples are the characters April Ludgate from the TV show Parks and Recreation played by Aubrey Plaza, or Bob Newhart as Arthur Jeffries in The Big Bang Theory.",0
Another example is the often philosophical comedy of Steven Wright.,0
"Dry humor is often confused with highbrow or egghead humor, because the humor in dry humor does not exist in the words, their delivery, or both.",-1
"Instead, the listener must look for humor in the contradiction between words, delivery and context.",0
Failure to include the context or to identify the contradiction results in the listener finding the dry humor unfunny.,1
"However, the term ""deadpan"" itself actually only refers to the method of delivery.",1
Other deadpan comedians: Stephen Colbert Christopher Walken Jimmy Carr Buster Keaton Peter Sellers Jonathan Katz Aubrey Plaza Todd Barry Jack Handey Mitch Hedberg Demetri Martin Paul Merton Nathan Fielder Tim &amp; Eric Leslie Nielsen Jane Curtin Jim Gaffigan Dan Mintz Jack Dee H.,0
Jon Benjamin Styles within deadpan Deadpan can vary in subtlety.,0

"Hi, this is Elaine with Investor's Business Daily and we're about two hours away from the close right now and I've got a slightly after midday market update for you.",-1
"So major indexes are all broadly down as housing starts for July exceeded expectations and the consumer price index for the month was unchanged, as expected.The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are both down around 0.4% and the NASDAQ is down 0.5%. Off-price retailer TJX is down over 5% today despite a Q2 beat on Q3 and full-year outlook that fell short of expectations.",1
Now that means that shares have now fallen out of buy range after clearing a 79.26 entry point last month.,0
Ross stores is also down slightly today.,1
"meanwhile Macy's is up around 1% continuing a five session win streak which is sort of an interesting juxtaposition for both department stores and off-price retailers, since off-pricers have generally been seen as outperformers in the retail space, while department stores have generally been struggling.",1
Because our majors have a variety of career goals in mind we offer them a variety of internship experiences based on their specific needs and their specific goals.,0
"I'm also co-director of the center for civic engagement which has a long history of active participation by sociologists here, and as co-director I arrange internships with community-based organizations working on social justice, deepening democracy and promoting sustainability in the area.",1
"These experiences are not just the sort of internships where you do the Xeroxing for some organization, but in fact they're real learning, hands-on experiences where you meet the clients or the people that are served by this organization where you work with them, where you follow professionals and mirror what they do.",1
You get not only a lot of experience but an idea whether of that is the right career path for you.,2

"Many Americans do not have a household budget, so as a result, they're ending up seeing less a month left and less money at the end of the month.",0

"Well, one thing that I think that women, or the people in general, don't realise is that women vote more than men in the States, and women just don't run for office in nearly the numbers that men do, but this is looking like it might be a really great year for women in politics we have more women running for office this year than we've ever had before, and, more democrats and republicans but it's still a nice mix and that's really exciting to me, because of course in the 2010 election we actually lost - we went backwards with just a tiny bit with the number of women in elected office.",1
"Recently we had a great event thanks to the former National Society of Hispanic MBAs, which is now Prospanica",3
And the event was called Career Accelerator,1
It was an opportunity for current MBA and graduate students to practice their interview and their resume skills,2
"A question that was asked a lot before, during, and after the event was: How to prepare for an interview? And there are several things that you have to do to be ready for an interview, but one important thing is to practice your stories",1
And one thing I tell people to help them understand what practicing their stories means is that they have to think of themselves as comedians,1
"Comedians practice their material all the time, not because they are fake just because they want their audience to have the time of their life",1
"That's exactly what you have to think of when you are going to an interview but instead of telling jokes you are telling your professional stories, you are telling the stories of the challenges you've faced in your professional career and you're gonna tell them the steps you took to overcome those challenges",1
So always be thinking STAR method,1
"Situation, Task, Action, Result",1
So that your stories can be efficient and effective in communicating what you wanna communicate,0
It's important that you are practicing your stories because we are going to have a great opportunity here in Houston,0

"If you go outside as well, you need to have one of those, a space suit",1
And it's very difficult to maintain the space suit,2
It takes a lot of work,2
But it's also very hard to work inside of them,2

There is two methods that I would actually highlight right now in terms of what we’re doing to get better consumer insight.,1
"One is a tool that we developed which is called Star Com EQ, which is emotional intelligence research.",0
So we have done several waves of research talking to consumers where we’re looking to understand what are the emotional need states that they are looking to answer when they make media channel selection.,2
And what the content in those channels is doing to solve emotional need states.,1
And it’s actually become a wonderful tool in really understanding what is driving consumers channel selection.,1
"And it’s not always rational, it’s very much emotional at times.",1
"The other thing that we have done is we are putting in place global communities, it is called the mic at Star Com, and these are global listening communities that we have where we can at any point in time put out questions to these communities.",1

"It is called ""Cinderella""",2
"I'm not referring to the old animated Disney movie or the movie ""Ever After"", which was a great adaptation",1
"Now, I'm going to be reviewing the newest ""Cinderella"" live-action movie",0
I didn't know what to expect going into this movie,1
"You know, kid's movies half the time don't work for me and half the time they do",0
"So I was curious as to how they could pull it off and, surprisingly, they pull it off really well in this movie",-1
Of course I stayed until the end to look at some of the credits and the ironic thing is I saw that the writing credit was to Chris Weitz,3
"Who is Chris Weitz, you may ask? He is one of the two brothers who directed the 1999 teen raunchy comedy film ""American Pie""",2

"I really liked the characters in the movie, the performances were really well, the visual effects were spectacular",2
I was amazed at how advanced they've gotten lately in movies when it comes to that,2
"I want you all to meet my new girlfriend, Issy",-2
So I am going to ask her what she thought of the movie,2

"From a 1 to 10, what would you give the movie ""Cinderella""? 10",1

"As for me, I would give the movie an 8 out of 10",2
I think it's really good,-1

"The Road Not Taken BY ROBERT FROST Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both and be one traveler, Long I stood and looked down one as far as I could to where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black",1

What was clear back then is still clear today: that challenges like reproductive health care and family planning are bigger than the political boxes that some try to force them into.,3
These are basic human necessities that hundreds of millions of women are forced to go without.,2
"For some, it's because they can't afford or don't have access to these services.",2
"For others, it's because their husbands or their communities simply don't support their use.",1

"But also for China, ironically, because both Europe and China on one hand are countries of old civilization, which have creativity, which have inventions.",0

I'm ASIC Commissioner John Price There has been a lot of reporting on ASIC's investigation into the share trading of David Jones two directors and the proposal from Myer.,-1
"ASIC has examined this matter thoroughly, including this proposal and decided there is insufficient evidence to take enforcement action.",1
"This decision is not an exoneration or a tick of approval and if more evidence comes to light, the matter can be re-opened.",1
"Generally, there are four things ASIC must prove for any insider trading case.",1
"First, you need to show traders actually had the information.",-2
"Second, the information needs to be ""inside"" information so it was not generally known to the rest of the market.",-2
"Third, that the information was ""material"" in that it would have a material effect on the price or value of the company's shares.",-1
"And last, ASIC needs to prove the trader knew or ought to have known the information was material and not publicly available.",-1
Proving all of these things is generally a very hard thing to do.,0
"So with insider trading, ASIC will use its powers to look at all information, and interview all key people.",1
"We also use independent experts who have experience in the markets, particularly on materiality.",-1
And that's because dairy milk requires about 12 times as much water as almond milk and that's something that people don't always consider,1

The book for this week was: Solve for Happy how to engineer your way to happiness by Mo Gawdat and he's the chief business officer of Google X,2

This guy's an engineer and he takes it very systematically,2
"This isn't like any ""self-help"" book, it isn't a self-help book really",2
This is the systematic approach to solving happiness,1
"He covers a wide variety of topics, things like your idea of time, your idea of death and he explains them so simply but so fundamentally that it will definitely change the way you look at the world and it'll improve the way that you see everything in your life and it will solve your happiness equation",1
You will definitely be a happier and better person after reading this book and I know that usually in these videos I summarize something,0
"I give you guys one or two little tit-bits to take away, but I've been racking my brain trying to figure out what I was going to take out of this book to share with you and it's impossible",1
There is so much good information that I really couldn't pick one thing,2
"So if I can give you one suggestion get this book, buy it on kindle start reading it",3
You can take a random chapter and it will blow your mind and completely change the way that you see the whole world,2

- Let's take a look at the cell cycle.,1
The cell cycle is the entire life cycle of a cell that includes possibly mitosis or nuclear division.,2
"If we were to throw the stages of the cell cycle on to a little circular image, what you would see is that the cell is in a stage called interphase most of the time.",0
All of that is interphase.,0
Interphase is essentially where the cell is doing its thing.,0
Hanging out being a cell.,1
There are specific characteristics.,1
"For example, during interphase the cell's DNA looks like this.",2
"Dude, I feel like I've got Barkley the dog from ""Sesame Street"" hanging out here with me.",1
"So most of the time that a cell is hanging out, it's in interphase.",0

"We're here talk now about hour 18, Texts J and K",1
"And Greg, I was wondering these are part of the text I each of them",-1
"And what do you think is new and different that you separated these parts out as separate focused passages? Well, what I want to emphasize about Text J, which is part of the Text I, it is this privileged position of Theseus as not only the founding hero of Athens as understood by the democracy in the 5th century, a version of the city of Athens but also his role as the initiator of all Athenians into what is called the Eleusinian Mysteries",2
"The reference to looking and hearing in a special way and which also involves not looking and not hearing, or can I say not visualizing and not verbalizing in other ways, is just pure mystery",0
It's the way an initiator initiates worshippers into mysteries,1
"And that's why I want to come back to this part and try to make it understandable in terms of the fifth century of Athens, which was a very sophisticated period in the history of the city, but which is still clinging to these fundamental notions of what is a cult hero",0
"What is it like to be initiated into the mysteries of a cult hero? And how does that have to do with my role and your role as a citizen in [INAUDIBLE]? That's what this is all about and that's what, certainly, Sophocles is concentrating on and that's why he's so fascinated with Theseus",-1
And the flip side is that's also why he's so fascinated with Oedipus himself who is a character that he has brought to life in other aspects of that character's life,1
"But here, in Oedipus at Colonus, Sophocles, who's in his 90s, really identifies with this wretched old man and how he's struggling with the difficulties of old age and the prospect of dying",0
"I can just bet that the citizens of Athens as they thought about Sophocles towards the end of the 5th century would have thought about how the old man and his very, very long career, which is full of sufferings as well as successes, could be identified with Oedipus as a cult hero",1
"And that's why at the end, I'm asking myself, well, who is the referent here? ""The man did not need lamentations and there were no diseases that gave him any pain at the moment when he was escorted away",1
"But what Marx saw was that just as we freed ourselves from these natural constraints, we entangled ourselves in new social constraints",-1

"In this ""primitive communism,"" as Marx called it, people were strongly bound by natural constraints, but socially very equal",0

"But you also have the peasantry, who still worked constantly, making food",-1

"- So what actually is personal branding? You hear people saying brand yourself and have a personal brand, but knowing actually what it is and how to do it is another story",1
So I am Tori from torimackle,1
,1
That is what I am going to talk about today,1
"So when you brand yourself, you are at the centre of your business",1
"Not your products, not the things that you recommend, but actually you",1
"So you probably heard this before, people actually relate to people and not businesses or companies",1
"So with a personal brand, you can build a following of people that know, like and trust you",2
"And when people trust you, they're now more likely to listen to your recommendations and want to know what it is that you are doing and how they can get the same thing or what it is what you are recommending because they trust that if they listen to you, they are going to get the solutions that they are after and it's the solutions that are the most important",1
"With a personal brand, it doesn't matter what happens with social media or any company that you are associated with or any products that you recommend because you are at the centre of your business",1
So it doesn't matter what happens with those things because your business is always going to be long term and sustainable if it is about you and your personal brand,1
Everything else is like spokes that come off this central point which is you,0
"Now, it may or may not be a surprise to you that you actually already have a personal brand",1
Your personal brand really is about your values and what you stand for and showing people that,1
So people can have a personal brand that actually don't have a business,2
"If you've got a lot of people that look up to you as an authority in a certain area, as a leader in some description, then you probably already have a personal brand",2
So a personal brand really is what you are known for by other people,2
So what do other people say about you? What do other people say that you do for a living? Those are the things that are actually represented in a personal brand,0
"Now, personal brands can actually open a whole bunch of doors for you and if you make your personal brand official and make it a business, then you can actually monetize those opportunities which is what is super exciting about a personal brand and it is really something that you build overtime",1
A personal brand isn't something that you can not have one day and have the next day,0
"You might make it more official, but you actually don't create a personal brand that doesn't already exist within you",1
So that is my message for today,2
If you would like to leave your biggest takeaway message in the comments that you would be great,2
I love to hear what you guys think and pop over to my blog torimackle,1
- So when looking at financial aid opportunities the first thing I looked at were scholarships.,2
I applied to a lot and basically just did a quick Google search of scholarships that pertained to things that I was interested in.,1
"Applied to as many as I could, that was, you know, humanly feasible, and then I actually ended up getting a couple.",2
Hi there.,1
"[Jazzy hip-hop music] If there's one thing that storytelling teaches us about life, it's that different objectives require different tactics, that achieve different results",2
,1
One thing always leads to another,1
"Applying this theme to marketing reveals at least one universal truth: at the beginning of any project, make sure your entire team, especially the final stakeholders and decision-makers, are all seeing the same objective as the end goal",-1
"If you have different and conflicting objectives, you're gonna look for different tactics to achieve different results, and you're setting yourself up for incoherence",-1
Let me give you a hypothetical,2
"Let's imagine that we have a client together, and their goal is to sell their product online to 15-21 year old men on YouTube",1
,-1
That's a clear objective,2
We lay out a 180 day strategy,2
We start creating daily content on YouTube for them,2
"Sales start to go up, and they can see that the conversion is coming from the audience on YouTube",-1
"But then as we get towards the end of the schedule, the end of the strategy, someone remarks, ""We don't like that the number of subscribers to our YouTube channel isn't as high as we'd like it to be",-1
""" Or, ""We don't like that there aren't more people coming from YouTube to our other social channels as we'd like there to be",1
""" Those notes provide an excellent opportunity to pivot towards new goals, but they were never the target objective",0
The target objective was to sell to 18-21 year old men on YouTube,1
"But at the end, not everyone's measuring success the same way",1
"When your team all has the same objective in mind and is measuring success the exact same way, that becomes your North Star",1
It makes hard choices so much easier,1
It allows you to assess so much easier going forward,1
"If you're aiming for 18-20 year old men, and the only people engaging with your content are 35-50 year old women, hmm, something's weird",2
We've gotta pivot here,1

"Well, if you considering the purchase of Payne gas furnace, only 41 percent of consumers have a favorable opinion of them.",1
That is certainly off putting.,-1
What sort of things do they say about the furnace?,-1

LetÕs begin by looking at spontaneity.,-1
"Spontaneity Both writing and talking involve an audience, but in writing, the audience either does not respond directly to the author or does so long after the writing has occurred.",1
"In speaking, there is immediate feedback.",1
"For the purposes of this lecture series, I want to just consider conversation and not public speaking which has more similarities to writing.",0
"SoÉas I was saying, conversation offers immediate feedback because the listener will respond with words or actions based upon what we said.",1
"This interlocutor, the person we are talking with, may ask a question or offer words of encouragement.",1
The speaker needs to answer the question or encouragement while continuing with the information they are sharing.,-1

﻿If your company is growing,1
"If you're adding more people to your team, or if you've just already got a decent sized business",2
Then you're probably thinking a lot about how your company can have more effective meetings,3
And what kind of meetings your company should be having,1
And that's what I want to talk about in this video,1
"So a couple months back, at the recommendation of some friends, I spent about a month diving into the best resources on meetings",0
Three books that I got were Patrick Lencioni Death by Meeting,0
"Cameron Harold's, Meetings Suck",1
And then I spent a lot of time reading the chapter on meetings in Scaling Up,0
"I believe it was either Scaling Up, or Retraction",2
Both of those books have stuff on meetings,1
"And at the end of the day, what I found is that all fast-growing companies that are successful have a regular rhythm, and are in a really cohesive structure for how they are meeting",2
They don't just willy-nilly have meetings at random times,1
They have daily company meetings,1
They have weekly company meetings,1
They have different one-on-one meetings,1
They have different quarterly meetings,0
And the meetings are happening with a real rhythm and a real structure,0
"Like I said, not just randomly",1
So what we ended up doing in our company,0
People ask me about this a lot,2
Is that we have most of our meetings on Monday,1
"So on Mondays, each of our business areas has a one-hour weekly action review meeting",1
I attend two of those meetings every Monday,1
And then all of our one-on-one meetings happen weekly on Mondays as well,1
"So all of my direct reports, I meet with each of them for up to an hour",1
It's usually more like a half an hour every Monday,1
So it's a lot of meetings on Mondays but you really get to set the week off in the right way,1
"You get to start the week on the right foot and then the rest of your week is clear to work on the priorities and the goals, and the projects that you set for yourself at the beginning of the week",2
"And then throughout the rest of the week, we do a few different things",1
"We have daily huddles that are about 15 minutes long, sometimes less, depending on the number of people in them",0
And we'll have a couple of different ones,0
"We have a leader huddle which is for the leaders in the company, our senior leadership",1
And then each business area has a huddle each day,1
"And myself and our CEO, we will bounce in and out of different meetings each day",1
"So on one day, I will attend a meeting with our training division",1
"On the next day, I might be with customer service",0
"On the next day, I might be with marketing etc",1
"And then on Wednesdays, we have a one-hour company-wide meeting",1
It's the only meeting we have in our company that is everybody in the company for one hour,-1
And there are a lot of businesses,1
"If you're a little bit smaller than we are, who have company-wides daily",1
They will have a daily huddle that has everybody in the company,2
But we have 25 people in our company right now as I'm recording this,2
And it just isn't effective,3
"I think if you have over ten people in your company, having a daily company-wide just becomes a little bit inefficient",1
"So reach out to me if you have any questions about any of this, or leave a comment under this video",1
I'd be happy to give you any thoughts on this,2
"It's something that has really, really energized our company",1
"We have a great rhythm now where we know every day what meetings are happening, when",-1
And a really specific structure for how these meetings are conducted,2
"And I'll tell you, everybody on our team that has really loved it and it's made us a lot more productive",1

"Then we send that via Bluetooth to your mobile and we portray your reactions, in real time, as your body is responding to those situations you can see it",0

It increases County spending on the Montgomery County Public Schools by almost $136 million ($90 million over Maintenance of Effort) and It addresses a $50 million loss to County revenues caused by the Wynne court case.,-1
The budget closes an estimated $178 million gap.,-1
"Over the last ten years, I have closed over $3.3 billion in budget gaps while putting the County’s fiscal house back in order and making the investments necessary to build a better future.",1
Lighting the lamp of learning is the most important thing we can do.,0
"Our public schools have been funded at, or below, the level defined as ‘Maintenance of Effort’ since FY 09. On a per-pupil basis, funding has not increased.",2
We are adding 2000-plus students a year.,2
Class sizes have grown.,2
There has not been sufficient progress in closing the achievement gap that exists between many of our minority students and non-minority students.,2
I believe we must provide the Superintendent and the Board of Education with additional funding to further address these challenges.,-2
"To do this, my proposed property tax rate increase is 3.9 cents above the current rate.",-1
"The average tax bill (for a house assessed at $464,000) increases by about $27 a month or $325 annually.",2

For many years I sat in church and would hear the pastor's sermon.,1
We would learn the reason we do not hear from God clearly is because of all the distractions and all the noise of our culture.,-1

"MOST people do NOT hear from GOD, let alone obey Him.",-1
"If you cannot hear from Him, HOW can you follow Him and obey Him?",0
And if you are not obeying Him you cannot possibly be pleasing to Him.,1
"It starts with a relationship with Him in prayer, seeking Him in private.",0
"You don't have to tell other people that you are going to go and pray, or you don't have to go into a church building to do it.",1
"You just find a quite place, go on your knees and pray.",1
"If you cannot actually be on your knees in prayer, you can take a walk and you can pray, but just find a place that you are NOT distracted.",1
There are so many distractions and people are not willing to get those out of their life.,-1
"They like to say, ""Everything in moderation"", that is what was taught by the pastor in church.",-2
"They would say, ""The TV is a distraction, everything in moderation as long as you don't watch it too much... maybe only watch it a couple times a week instead of every day."" They are lying to you.",1

President Obama: Good afternoon everybody,1
Over the last several days the United States has been responding to events as they unfold in Ukraine,-1
Now throughout this crisis we have been very clear about one fundamental principle: the Ukrainian people deserve the opportunity to determine their own future,-2
"Together with our European allied, we have urged an end to the violence and encouraged Ukrainians to pursue a course in which they stabilize their country, forge a broad-based government, and move to elections this spring",-2
"I also spoke several days ago with President Putin - and my administration has been in daily communication with Russian officials - and we've made clear that they can be part of an international communities effort to support the stability and success of a united Ukraine going forward, which is not only in the interests of the people of Ukraine and the international community, but also in Russia's interest",-2
"However, we are now deeply concerned by reports of military movements taken by the Russian Federation inside Ukraine",1
"Russia has a historic relationship with Ukraine, including cultural and economic ties and a military facility in Crimea",-1
"But any violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity would be deeply destabilizing, which is not in the interest of Ukraine, Russia, or Europe",2
It would represent a profound interference in matters that must be determined by the Ukrainian people,2
"It would be a clear violation of Russia's commitment to respect the independence and sovereignty and borders of Ukraine, and of international laws",1
And just days after the world came to Russia for the olympic games it would invite the condemnation of nations around the world,1
"And, indeed, the United States will stand with the international community in affirming that there will be costs for any military intervention in Ukraine",-1
The events of the past several months remind us of how difficult democracy can be in a country with deep divisions,-1
But the Ukrainian people have also reminded us that human beings have a universal right to determine their own future,-1
Right now the situation remains very fluid,2
"Vice President Biden just spoke with the Prime Minister of Ukraine to assure him that in this difficult moment the United States supports his government's efforts and stands for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and democratic future of Ukraine",0
I also commend the Ukrainian government's restraint,-2
And its commitment to uphold its international obligations,0
We will continue to coordinate closely with our European allies,-1
We will continue to communicate directly with the Russian government,-1
And we will continue to keep all of you in the press corps and the American people informed as events develop,-2
"more than I ever have, to eat healthily",1
"Because eating healthy is something that I have struggled with my entire life because I have a partiality to really unhealthy foods and, as I said before, I find it really hard to stick to a new routine and cutting bad foods out of my diet, is a new routine",1
"But since that conversation, I have been eating significantly healthier",1
"I mean, I haven't cut down completely on cow's milk because i prefer the taste of cow's milk to almond milk and I'm not a vegan",2
"However, this got me thinking, I guess, about the value of impulse versus reason and logic and consideration",1

My client has something to say that needs to be said.,2
She has things to say that no one else is going to say.,0
She has a cause to advance that no one else will.,0

"I examined a lot of leaders and Wakefern I was fortunate Wakefern as a lot of great leaders, and I took a little bit of each of their story about respect or communication or clarity or just being in the moment",0
"And, you take that and you make that part of your story and your narrative as you go forward",1
"And, there were a lot of mentors and a lot of leaders that were willing to take their time both formally and informally and guide us forward",1
Create a story that others are going to tell about you,1
Most of your career when you're in high school and college you're telling your story to get that next level,2
Once you're in a workplace others are going to tell your story and make sure that story of something that you want to hear,1

But maybe you can help us thinking about this,1

Not a civil debate because in a debate you try to convince the other of your opinion,1

"they were called all manner of names like sissy, girly, et cetera, et cetera",-2
And this was a thing that we had a bit of a conversation about before shooting the episode,1
"The people involved in that conversation all had really different experiences and my personal experience, as someone who was called no shortage of terrible names growing up, was that the people using those insults didn't see me necessarily as referencing another gender in my actions but rather saw femininity as an insult to hurl at a young boy",0
"That it wasn't that I was being girly but that girliness was an insult, which I realize is maybe kind of like splitting hairs",1
"But, of course, that doesn't mean that other people have had exactly that experience and so there was definitely room for more nuance when we made that point",2
Hi and welcome to the Tuesday Tip! We are in the middle of the gift giving season,1
"Have you treated your loved ones or yourself to a Genius Ultra? How rewarding would it be to give your mom, your sister, your brother or your best friend the gift of beautiful, youthful-looking skin in 2017? Today's Tuesday Tip is about which products work best with your Genius Ultra and which ones to avoid",2
The good news is that most Arbonne skincare products are perfect pairs to use with your Genius Ultra,1
Here on my left are some products we recommend you use with the Genius Ultra,-1
"You'll see some RE9, some Calm some RE9 Advanced for Men and some body products! You're good to go! There are so many products outside of just what is here that you can use with your Genius Ultra",0
Now on my right is a different story,2
These are products we recommend you not use together with your Genius Ultra,0
And I'll tell you why Don't use with products that contain SPF,1
This is any day cream or moisturizer which says SPF on the front panel,1
The efficacy of the SPF can be compromised if used together because of the chemical or mineral sunscreen composition,-1
"However, we do recommend using an SPF after you finish the Genius Ultra during the day",1
Just don't use them together,2
Then there's acne products,2
This include the entire Clear Future Collection,0
"Because this collection includes the active salicylic acid, it's recommended that you not use this together with your Genius Ultra",1
"Last but not least, are products you would normally use with water",2
"This includes cleansers, shaving creams, rinse-off masks",2
The Genius Ultra cannot be submerged or put under running water,1
So it's best to steer clear when using these types of products with your Genius Ultra,1
"Now, if you're hesitant about how your skin will react to the Genius Ultra with specific Arbonne products, we recommend you test them together on the inside part of your forearm",0
Wait 24 hours and check for any adverse reaction,1
"If there's no reaction, then you're probably safe to use these products together with your Genius Ultra",1
I hope this helps clear up any questions that you had,1

It prepared me for many life circumstances that I have endured and has given me focus in my personal endeavors.,-1

They want more of your money and more of your rights to keep on pursuing all of these temporary policies eleven years later.,-2

"Now, let's talk about speaking extemporaneously.",0
"This is actually, probably, the way that most of your speeches will be delivered, especially in a speech class.",-1
"You will be taught and expected, primarily, to do extemporaneous speaking.",0
,1
"a lot of people, they write a beautiful speech, and they're just not sure how to communicate it",2
Its hard - you don't know what to do,1
There are so many unfamiliar and unfriendly looking faces in the crowd,2
"So how do you give a speech that is confident, funny, debonair and charming? Well it all comes down to execution our first tip in execution - lose those notes! If i'm looking down at my paper all the time, its really hard to form a connection",2
You're just not going to register as much because it doesn't seem real,0
"So lose those notes, buy instead of having a whole script that you have to get through - having a few key points that you illustrate with stories",2
Stories are easy to retell without needing notes because you already know them,2
"So limit yourself to using stories, and your speech is going to be much more effectively communicated, and you're going to feel a lot more confident giving it",0
Second point when you're delivering a speech is eye contact,1
You want to make sure that you're looking all around at the various guests in the room,2
You want to make a personal connection with each and every one of them,1
Try varying your gaze every few seconds to different parts of the room and that will make a huge difference in peoples ability just to interact with you and feel like they're being personally spoken to during your speech,2
"It can get a little intimidating looking into the eyes of complete strangers, especially because people tend to have their tv face on when they're watching a speech they're just deers in the headlight kind of thing",1
"So one tip we can give you is to look at the friendly faces - focus on a few key people in the audience who are smiling, who ARE engaged, and just keep alternating between them when you're looking during your speech",1
"Tip number 3 - you've lost your notes, you're making eye contact, that's great",1
Now you have to make sure you're watching the clock,1
Stories are fantastic but they can also be long winded and drawn out,1
"A 45 second speech is no good because people won't think its heartfelt, but a 45 minute speech is going to have your audience in tears - and not the good kind! So make sure you're practicing your speech in advance",1
"Pull out your iphone, your smartphone, and time yourself ahead of the wedding so that you know exactly how long it is",2
A good speech length is anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes,1
"Of course if you've got an amazing story, and amazing connection with the groom or bride it can go a little longer",1
"But generally, the shorter, the more people are going to appreciate it, and the better they're going to be engaged",1
Once you've timed your speech and you know how long its going to be you go a long way in keeping peoples attention,2
"And finally our last point in giving a strong, confident speech, is to be conversational",1
You don't need to have every little word scripted out,3
If you're telling stories and you're talking - just try to stay natural,2
"Keep your body language active, don't stand rigid at the stage, and just relax",1
Pretend its a conversation between two people not a conversation with 500 other people,2
A speech shouldn't really be a speech - it should be more of a conversation,1
Each member of the audience should feel like they're being personally spoken to,2
"If you do that - you keep it conversational, you use stories, you make eye contact, you lose those notes, you're going to give an incredible wedding speech",2
So feel confident and enjoy this opportunity to tell the bride and the groom how much they mean to you,2
"You're going to do great! If you still aren't sure how to write your wedding speech, head back to our previous video: the 5 keys to writing a great wedding toast",1
"Goals Speaker: Dr. Erma Jean Sims, Sonoma State University There are four main goals of this session on mandatory child abuse reporting.",1
The first goal is to help teachers develop knowledge about what child abuse is and to familiarize teachers with mandatory child abuse reporting requirements.,-1
The second goal is to help teachers gain an awareness and understanding of the laws that pertain to mandatory child abuse reporting and how to prevent legal liability.,0
The third goal is to help teachers recognize incidents of child abuse in their own classrooms.,1
The fourth one is to help teachers identify appropriate ways to respond to both known and suspected incidents of child abuse and neglect.,1
We will accomplish these goals by reviewing the law that pertains to mandatory child abuse reporting.,1
We will discuss scenarios in which you will have an opportunity to make real world application of the law to these scenarios.,1
These child abuse scenarios were designed to heighten your consciousness to similar incidents of child abuse you may encounter in your own classroom.,0
At the end of this session on mandatory child abuse reporting you should be able to do four things.,-1
increase your skills to help you lead your teams with more excellence,2
"As I mentioned, if you're tuning in you have a overly talkative person in your group",1
So let's unpack why this is in the first place and look at some tips for dealing with it,1
The first thing to realize is that in most cases the overly talkative people don't realize that they're causing a little bit of a imbalance or a problem,-1
"In fact, it probably started early on in the group where you tried to get a discussion going as the leader",0
"Nobody else talked and so they felt like they wanted to jump in to break the ice, kind of the way we want people to be the first one at the buffet",0
"Once someone goes at the buffet, everybody can go to the buffet",0
"So they feel like by jumping in, they're helping break the ice and warm things up",1
Then it starts to sometimes set into a pattern where nobody talks so they always want to talk,1
Nobody talks so they always want to talk,1
Cause they feel obligated and responsible,-1

Hey everybody this Graphic Designer Roberto Blake with another Graphic Design quick tip for you today's quick tip is about investing in your personal branding!,1
Your brand is what people say about you when you're not in the room.,2
"If you think about brand like Apple it can be summed up in a few words... innovative, clean, cutting-edge savvy, well-designed, whatever you want.",1
Whatever you think of when you think about Apple is what represents its Brand and the story that it's telling.,1
If you think about it's advertising and marketing its all frame in that way the same thing for other companies like Adobe and Sony.,1
They've also come up with different taglines to be able to you associate the values that they want to communicate for their brand with an audience.,2
As a designer you need to do the same thing.,2
So I talked about creating your own visual style and that's definitely part in developing a brand but there are other things you need to do.,1
You come up with a possible tagline for yourself and what you doing.,0
I have a couple them as you know: One of them is CREATE AWESOME another one is ALWAYS BE CREATING and one of my favorite ones is:  MAKING THE IMPOSSIBLE or  MAKING IT HAPPEN.,1
"There are a lot of ones that I throw in different scenarios based on the context That's another one that I do use by the way: Creativity, Consistency and Context that's something I'm known for saying.",0
You need to find out what makes sense for you in terms the story you want to tell and how you presented and you need to find your own voice and communicate the values that you bring to the table.,3

"She was nominated, and won, for Walk the Line back in 2006 - the culmination of her meteoric rise which began with her breakout role in Legally Blonde",0
"But little did Witherspoon know that she was peaking, as she found herself starring in a string of box office flops for the next few years",-2
"In fact, she STILL hasn’t been able to climb out of her box office slump",0
"So again, like Cotillard, at least she can still hang onto her artistic reputation with this nomination",1
But one thing that is different this time around - and from Cotillard - is that this nomination also helps give Witherspoon some credibility as a producer,2

"[QUESTION: I heard you guys have a group interview process what exactly is that?] Well, first of all it's not exactly an interview.",1
"Rather, it's a team-based activity designed to give us additional insight into your interpersonal and communication skills.",1
"If we invite you to interview after reviewing your application, you will also be invited to participate in the team exercise - which will be held on campus in all three admission rounds.",1
We will also have several international locations for the team exercised in round two.,1
Locations and dates for those will be based on where our apps are coming from - so stay tuned for more information on that.,-1
[QUESTION: I read on the application that the team exercise is optional.,1
Is it really optional?,1
"Like, if I don't participate will you hold it against me?]  We get this one a lot, so let me tell you: the team exercise is 100% Optional.",1
Not participating won't hurt you in the admissions process but you'll be missing an opportunity to add another positive impression of you to our evaluation.,-1

Hi everyone!,3
Kristina here.,3
I just wanted to give you guys a really quick update on what's been going on and why you haven't been on such a regular schedule.,2
At least not the usual regular schedule.,2
The main reason is I have a lot of family stuff come up recently and it's stuff that kind of takes me away from home.,2
"So I'm not, I don't have as much time to make videos for you guys.",1
So that's the main reason and everything's going to be okay.,2
It's nothing tragic or anything like that.,2
"Just, you know you have to put family first for a little while.",2
So that's what I'm doing.,2
The second reason why you guys haven't seen me posting card videos as often is I'm in LA right now.,3

One way to test the market for your product is to build a web site (low cost) and see if you can even get one buy for the product.,2
Bill Gross of Idea Labs did this when he started Cars.com The Team The team you have in place for the overall execution of your company is one of the most essential components to ensuring you have the right people in place.,1

&gt;&gt; I do see picky eaters but I see everything from a typically developing kid with picky eating to kids that have significant developmental or medical issues who have not learned how to eat because of their developmental and medical issues.,-1
"So the initial visit, when parents come in, they can expect just to be asked a lot of questions and their kid gets to play.",1
"If the kid is old enough to participate and answer questions, if they want, they can but it's just talking.",2
"The second session, I ask the parents to bring in food and we actually start feeding the kid then and I observe how it usually goes now and then based on what I observe, I start to intervene and start the treatment to see what works so I can send the parents home with a plan after just the second session.",1
"I establish a relationship with the parents by listening very carefully to what's stressing them because when a kid isn't eating, it is extremely stressful to families.",2
"So figuring out exactly what's stressing them out, it tells me how quickly I can go so I'm not asking the family to do too much.",-1
"I establish relationships with kids with videos, bubbles, I will sing, no one likes it to come to that but I will sing, anything to make the kid happy.",2
Hay my name is Amanda and I just wanted to make a quick video about payday loans online and the experience I've had personally with them and I know that some people call them same day loans or online cash loans which they are all pretty much the same thing.,2

This is a quick summary and analysis of Coraline by Neil Gaiman.,1
This is a story about a girl named Coraline who lives in the countryside with her mother and father.,1
She is an adventurous girl who likes to explore.,-1
She lives in a large house that is divided into two other units.,-1
One is occupied by two retired theatre stars and the other is occupied by an old man who trains mice.,1
"As she explores her house, she finds a door with a brick wall behind it.",1
"However, when she tries to open the door a second time, she finds that it leads to a mysterious world that is similar to her own.",1
"In this Other world, she meets her Other Mother and Other Father, two figures that are similar to her real parents, but they have button eyes.",1
"They treat her well and they want her to stay, but she insists that she go back to her own world in fear of having buttons sewn in her eyes.",1
"After her parents disappear in the real world, Coraline goes back to the Other World to find her parents.",1
"There, she discovers that her Other Mother has tricked other children into leaving the real world.",-1
Coraline challenges her Other Mother to find the three souls of the children and her parents.,0
"As per agreement, if Coraline finds the souls first, she and the rest of them get to return to the real world.",0
"If her Other Mother finds them first, Coraline will stay in the Other World.",2
Coraline finds all three souls in marbles throughout the house and find her parents in a snow globe.,2
"With the help of a cat, she escapes through the door and back into the real world.",1
"Despite escaping, Coraline must deal with her Other Mother’s hand, which is crawling around and trying to steal a key that is around Coraline’s neck.",0
"In the end, after trapping her Other Mother’s hand in a well, Coraline begins to fix her relationship with her parents.",2
"As always a lot can be said about this story, but what draws my interest and attention is the idea of dual worlds, as if everything in this world is mirrored in another world.",1
"More importantly, this book explores how roles and relationships change in those dual worlds.",0
"So, let's talk about science and beauty at the same time.",-1
&gt;&gt; There's often been a dichotomy set up or proposed that really pits morals against researchers in saying that in proposing that human embryonic stem cell creation is tantamount to murder as it involves the destruction of the blastocyst.,-1

My interest in the  LSE program really focused on my interest in sustainability.,2
"As an undergraduate student at Portland State I got really involved in the Take Back the Tap campaign, which is involved in installing water bottle refilling stations and I knew that as I was looking for a graduate program that something like the LSE program would be a great place where I could continue to make change but also learn about how to kind of empower other people in making change, specifically in kind of educational contexts.",2
"In yoga, the practice of meditation is called Dhyana.",1
The gig economy is freelancers and people working for themselves,1
It gives us the opportunity to do some of the things that we really want to do instead of working a full time job,1
People go from project to project or day job to day job rather than having a job,0
This new frame of working where people provide services that they could do pretty easily to other people looking for them in a marketplace or technology enabled format,1
I would pick flexibility over a stable job with benefits because I like the idea that I can work when I need to and work really hard if I need more money and I'm my own boss,1
For me my work was never just a way to make a living,1
,0
,0
,1
I wanted it to be an expression of a passion,2
It took me a long time to find stability with benefits within the life coach industry,2
Having a flexible job and doing something that I'm really good at is more important than being in a nine-to-five,2
The gig economy can empower the worker because you have more flexibility over creating a career,1
I think that there are a lot of benefits out there that a lot of people don't know about,3
"You know, like Small Business Administration within each state",1
"If you believe in a lot of the things that unions supported, we don't have that kind of dynamic in the economy",1
"I think we're going to start seeing benefits packages pop up for the gig economy because so many people are missing out now on the tax front, on the healthcare front, on the retirement front",2
I think it's good for the society,2
"I think it gives people, especially people who aren't traditionally trained and low income, are able to kind of start up and do their own thing and seeing that others are doing that is helpful",2
So entrpreneurship kind of goes hand in hand,1

The last thing that we want to take a look at when we're talking about evaluating a speech and speaker with regards to presentation is overall poise and confidence.,1
How does the speaker present themselves?,-1

"If it’s someone you only just met and you don’t have an ongoing relationship with has done something that’s offended you or impacted you in some way, then simply saying “Look, I’m really angry with you” may be more appropriate than saying, “I feel really hurt that you cut in front of me in the traffic or whatever",-1

"If I look at our work, obviously, you need skills, fundamental skills, to understand if it's a go to market kind of work, then you need to understand how markets work.",1
But the core of the work that we do is about problem solving.,1
And having an engineering background or going through an engineering degree has its pros and cons.,0
"On one hand, they do allow you to think about how to break down a problem and look at different competence and come to kind of a design solution.On the other hand, they can potentially straight jacket you in problem solving which means in some sense they force you to move very quickly into a solution without really exploring a lot of different options or develop divergent thinking.I am a very firm believer that before you converge into a solution, you really need to explore different solutions.",-1
Keep on pushing the boundary of thinking.,0
"An engineering mindset is always to get to closure, get to the solution and then move on to execution.",1
And doing that very quickly can be a challenge because you probably do not explore all the solution options.,1
"And sometimes you may end up missing out on a truly innovative solution if you do that, if you close out a problem very quickly.",1
"But, as I said, it does give you a good handle in how do you solve problems, how do you think about a problem?",0
"Secondly, in a lot of the work, having mathematical skills and thinking is very critical.",1
"So, sometimes if you do not have that and you're coming from a background has not kind of built those skills, you might have a problem because a lot of our cases might require modeling.",1
They might require a kind of complex mathematical kind of analysis.,-1
And if you're not comfortable with numbers and spreadsheets then you can have a big problem.,1
Often engineers or others who have gone through courses which build those skills find it an advantage.,-1

"Wielenberg, you may remember, is a non-theist who believes in the objectivity of moral values and duties and who grounds them in a sort of moral Platonism",-1
"In response to my criticisms of his view, Wielenberg adopts a very interesting strategy",-1
"Philosophers call this strategy ""tu quoque,"" which is Latin for ""the same to you",-1
""" On the playground it would be, ""so's your old man!"" In other words, you don't answer the objection, you just throw it back in the face of your opponent and say, ""the same to you",0
You've got the same problem as me,1
Your view is just as bad as my view,0
""" Now the risk of this kind of a strategy is that it doesn't really answer the problem with your view",-2
"It just says that the other guy's view is as bad as yours and if your opponent can show that his view is not really analogous to your view, then you're stuck with this unresolved problem",1
"Moreover, this kind of a ""same to you"" response on Wielenberg's part is apt to provide aid and comfort to the other opponents of which, against which, he's arguing; namely, his fellow atheists who deny the objectivity of moral values and duties",0
Wielenberg is engaged in a two-front war,-1
"On the one hand he's battling against theists who affirm the objectivity of moral values and duties, but ground them in God",-1
On the other hand he's battling against his fellow atheists who deny that there are any objective moral values and duties,0
"And by adopting this ""tu quoque"" strategy against the theist he seems tacitly to admit that both his view and theism are encumbered with these unresolved problems, and that's going to make his fellow secularists who deny the objectivity of moral values and duties feel very good indeed",1
"In the March 19th election, we will not be selecting a new government",-1
The government of Canada will be fixed,1
"It is there already, and it’s not going to change",1
The differences in the numbers of the parties mean that there will be no dramatic shift in power,-1
Now the Liberals and the NDP will tell you that it is critical that they get another member,0
But the question really here is we’re only electing one member,0
We’re only sending one person to Parliament,1
So the question really is what is the best voice that we can send to Parliament that will most contribute to the dialogue,2
The opposition parties still have to work together to get anything past Parliament,-1
And they even have to pull some of the Conservatives,-1
"So we need a voice that can bring people together, that can galvanize people, that can even attract some of the Conservatives in order to get anything past the Harper government until we have a general election again in 2015",-1
Is that voice going to be another Liberal or another NDP person who will be sitting silently in the backbenches and given an order paper every day? Or is it going to be somebody who brings forward a clear vision and is given the voice to speak as loud and strong as possible for this community,0
So that this community has a voice in Parliament,0
I’m Elizabeth May’s Climate Change Critic,0
I’ve worked with her for three years on Shadow Cabinet and several years before that,0
"I’m a trusted confidante and I belong to a party that wants a bigger voice in Parliament that demands a bigger voice in Parliament And, it’s a party that respects the fact that individual members should have a voice and should always vote their conscience",0
This is financial adviser Patrick Munro talking about variable annuity drawbacks.,0
"Like the word implies, variable means up and down.",-1
"Most people would like their financial future to go up, maybe stay the same for a while in stormy times, but never go down.",0
Satan has fooled many Christians into thinking they don’t have to be separate to follow Jesus.,-2
They think that they can be part with the world and with sin and with people who live in sin.,1
"They don’t think that they have to come out and be separate to follow Jesus, BUT SATAN knows that if he gets you to fellowship with sinners, to take part in what they are doing then you won’t really have your eyes on Jesus, you won’t really follow Jesus with your heart, but you will just pay Jesus lip-service, but He will NOT have your heart.",-1
So many Christians are paying the LORD lip-service but they have NOT separated themselves from this world.,-2
They haven’t cut themselves of from sin or from the people who are living in sin.,-1
"If you are not willing to be severed from the world for the namesake of Jesus, then you’re not ready to be a disciple of Jesus.",-2
of democratic systems of government which haven't had any of those side benefits,-1
"In Afghanistan for example, we haven't had just one election or two elections, we've gone through three elections, presidential and parliamentary and what do we find",1
"Do we find a flourishing civil society, a vigorous rule of law and good security",-1

Hi this is Diana Barchenger and I came to Dr. Polzin to help me take care of the pains that I had in my feet.,1
"They would really get warm at night, when I had covers on my feet; I had sharp, shooting pains going through my feet and they are getting better to stand on, because before they would really hurt and every step in every area of my foot would hurt.",-2
"I encourage everybody to come in and give him a try, thanks.",2
MR TONER: The DPRK court has convicted U.S.,-1
citizen Otto Warmbier.,-1
"Mr. Warmbier was reportedly charged with, quote, “hostile acts against the DPRK,” end quote, and sentenced to 15 years’ hard labor.",-1
The Department believes that the sentence is unduly harsh for the actions Mr. Warmbier allegedly took.,-1
Despite official claims that U.S.,-1
"citizens arrested in the DPRK are not used for political purposes, it’s increasingly clear from its very public treatment of these cases that the DPRK does exactly that.",-2
It only underscores the risks associated with travel to North Korea.,-2
"These days, Europe needs a boost.",0
"We need to inject energy into the economy, generate tomorrow's jobs, and make public money work harder.",0
The cloud is a great way to do all of those things.,-1
"Giving everyone a ""locker"" to store their favourite pictures, music and films – and access them wherever they are.",2
"Offering cheaper, more flexible IT to boost businesses' bottom line.",1
"And enabling public services that are more integrated and effective, while saving taxpayers' money.",1
"All together, the benefits from more and better use of cloud computing could be worth several hundred euros a year for every European.",0
But only if we get the policy framework right.,2
"Already today, many people use a number of cloud services without even realising it – from webmail to Facebook.",1
And many companies are investing in cloud technologies.,2
"But many are held back – because they want their questions answered before they'll get ""cloud-active"". Questions like, can I easily transfer my data from one provider to another?",0
What happens if the provider goes bust?,1
"Or, how can I be sure my contract is safe and fair – even if I don't have a law degree?",2
"This uncertainty makes it harder to trust the cloud, and harder to unlock its benefits.",1
"Hello! I’m Kurt Browning, Pasco County Superintendent of Schools with an update on Hurricane Irma",0
We all know that hurricane paths can change from one update to the next,0
"Based on what we know now, and after consultation with Pasco County emergency operations leaders, we will need to open shelters in schools beginning Friday morning",0
That means we will have to close all schools on Friday,-1
"Although you may question why we are closing all schools, there are good reasons",-1
"First, the EOC doesn’t want school buses full of school children on the roads as evacuees from other parts of the state are arriving here",0
"We expect thousands of south and east coast Floridians to seek shelter here, or to pass through on their way further north",0
We also use school buses to help evacuate special needs citizens to shelters,0
Our food and nutrition services staff work in the shelters providing meals to evacuees,0
"Likewise, our maintenance and other employees staff the shelters",1
Principals whose schools are used as shelters have to prepare for evacuees and staff the shelter as long as people are still there,0
We also want to allow our employees time to prepare their homes and property for the impact of the storm,0
"The governor has closed all state offices on Friday, as well",-1
All sports and extracurricular activities are canceled for Friday and over the weekend,-1
"There’s a good chance that schools will be closed on Monday, but no decision has been made in that regard",0
"We will contact everyone on Sunday by phone and email, and will post information on the district and school websites and on district social media sites",-1
We also will notify media as decisions are made,-1
Please continue to make preparations,1

"So, today I was supposed to film an episode of Ask an Autistic, and it was going pretty well",0
"I was battling executive dysfunction, which kind of explains what bad thing happened",1
"But it was going okay and I did my makeup and I was like, alright, let's do this, I got my notes",1
And then I was like three minutes in and the battery died,0
"And now it's charging, but I won't be able to film an episode today, so I wanted to make use of my makeup and my words that I have and make a little vlog",-1
I don't know how to vlog,0

"Something I've wanted to address in the a/Autistic community is the ""throwing under the bus"" of intellectually and cognitively disabled people",-1
"Now, I know what you're thinking",-2
"""Amythest, no one's intending to hurt anybody else's feelings",1
""" And I'm like, I know",-1
But lateral violence in the disability community happens,0
And so here's what I see happening a lot,0
"There is autistic people, and they are talking about Autism and their neurotype, and they go to defend themselves by saying things like, ""Well, autistic people aren't stupid""",-2
"Or, they even use the r word",0
"Or, ""Autistic people are actually really smart",0
""" And in defense of non-speaking autistic people, it's like, ""Well you know, just because they look outwardly unintelligent doesn't mean that's true",0
"They could have a really high IQ""",-2
"Which, by the way, IQ is totally not a thing",-1
"It's super racist and ableist in its origins, and it's just terrible, and not even that accurate",2
"And super biased, towards white men",-1
"So, if you want to read about that, you know, video description",1
,2
"They're like, ""Oh, they have a high IQ, they are actually really intelligent, so that's why they deserve respect""",-1
"But the thing is that intelligence [scoffs] is this super racist, ableist, sexist concept",-1
"And yet, it's like, how a/Autistic people defend ourselves",1
And in the process we hurt our intellectually disabled and cognitively disabled disabled cousins,0
"And the thing is, there are a/Autistic people with intellectual disabilities as well",0
,0
And there is this valuing of traditional abled ideals of intelligence that is hurting the community,0
"When it all comes down to it, human beings deserve respect, and autonomy, and inclusion, and accommodation because they are human beings",1
