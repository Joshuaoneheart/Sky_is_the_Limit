But our Ukrainian partners rejected this possibility for reasons unknown to me.,0
It is common knowledge that the reverse-flow gas that they (Ukraine) are receiving from several European countries costs $20-30 more for consumers.,0

"Is it cheaper to receive Russian gas, or to get reverse-flow gas for $20-30 dollars more than the Russian price.",1

"And because they couldn’t get these jobs, Black communities had more men out of work, higher rates of poverty, and more criminal behavior",0
Which then allowed the white workers and unions to justify their decision to not allow black workers into their union,0
The prevailing beliefs about race and racism ultimately reinforced themselves,1
"This is what’s now known as racial formation theory, a theory formalized by modern sociologists Michael Omi and Howard Winant",1
"Racial formation refers to the process through which social, political, and economic forces influence how a society defines racial categories – and how those racial categories in turn end up shaping those forces",1
Omi and Winant argue that the concept of race came about as a tool to justify and maintain the economic and political power held by those of European descent,1
Another modern look at these issues can be seen in the work of sociologist William Julius Wilson,1

"Welcome to the Monday Morning Brief for February 6, 2017",1
The Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Committee is down to 11 members,1
Henry Louis Gates Jr,1
has left after serving the maximum 12 years allowed on the panel,1
"In an interview with Linn’s Washington Correspondent Bill McAllister, Gates said he would have never resigned from the panel, adding that it was his favorite one to serve on",1
"In addition to being a noted Harvard professor of African and African-American research, Gates is a literary scholar, journalist, author, filmmaker",1
"His documentaries include Finding Your Roots, which currently airs on PBS",1
The roots of the Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Committee are believed to date back to the 1940s,1
Many have suggested that it was the 1948 3¢ Poultry Industrial Chicken stamp — which has long been widely regarded as one of the least-necessary U,1
commemorative stamps ever — and other similar special-interest stamps that led to a call for a group to oversee the selection of topics to be honored on our postage,1
"Whatever the impetus, it was almost a decade before the Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Committee was established by Postmaster General Arthur E",1
Summerfield in March of 1957,1
"The announcement at the time said that the group “shall advise the Post Office Department on any matters pertaining to the subject matter, design, production and issuance of postage stamps",1
” The role of the committee hasn’t changed much,1
"On its website today, the United States Postal Service says, “The group selects subjects for recommendation as future stamp issues, made with all postal customers in mind, including stamp collectors",1
"” Also, as in 1957, the postmaster general is the one who appoints new committee members",1
"These members come from many different fields, the Postal Service specifically states that they “provide expertise on history, science and technology, art, education, sports, and other subjects of public interest",1
” The stamp hobby is represented as well,1
"The committee is currently chaired by Janet Klug, a lifelong collector, a former president of the American Philatelic Society and a Linn’s columnist",1
"Another prominent collector and the former chief curator of philately for the Smithsonian National Postal Museum, Cheryl Ganz, also serves on the committee",1
"As Bill McAllister points out in his report about Gates’ departure from the committee, its deliberations are kept secret",1
"However, McAllister said that Gates told him in an interview that the panel has approved all his suggestions for stamps celebrating the contributions of African-Americans to the United States",1
These include the three most recent stamps in the Black Heritage series,1
"They honori architect Robert Robinson Taylor; Bishop Richard Allen, founder of the African Methodist Episcopal Church; and most recently civil rights leader and activist Dorothy Height",1
"She was honored on a stamp just issued February 1, the first day of Black History Month",1
"Gates also told McAllister that an upcoming set of stamps will commemorate key players in the Harlem Renaissance, an early 20th-century cultural, artistic and social explosion",1
"Gates himself has been pictured on a postage stamp, part of a pane of six issued by Ghana in 1998 paying tribute to Great Black Writers of the 20th Century",1
"For Linn’s Stamp News and Scott catalogs, I’m Denise McCarty",0

"And the first afternoon he got in the car, he was hunky dory - travel, travel, travel",1
Three hours into the ride he starts getting fussy,1
Then we get out,1
We eat some dinner and he absolutely refuses to get back in the car,1
"And there is no way Im going to physically makes this little boy, who is about the size of a five-year-old, get back in that car",1

"Today I want to talk about how to respond to people who are telling you that something that you want, something you want to do or achieve is impossible.",1

"I shared a story, which you can watch in the previous video if you havent.",1
"This one, though, I want to focus on talking to other people, so say you have some sort of goal, idea, or dream, something that you want to bring into the world, and lets say youre talking to someone about it.",1

And the person said something like: Oh, well thats never going to happen. And I dont know what inspired me in the moment, but I called them out in a very specific way, I said: I dont agree that its not going to happen. I think its possible, and furthermore, I think that the belief that its not going to happen is part of the mentality thats holding us back from making it happen. I kind of was like: Wow, that actually came out of my mouth. But I said that, and the other person was just like, it just stopped them, and their whole face changed.",1

"I mean you know Tim Allen is pretty funny in it but the movie itself is so cheesy like its just its just (stutter) really cheesy and it says its going to be a ruff day, get it? Ruff day",0
(umm) Like Tim Allen turns into this shaggy dog like he literally turns into this dog,1
"He starts acting like a dog and its just like, what? What are you doing? Its just really cheesy but, kids, you know, laugh over it and think its really funny but, you know as an adult, itd probably put you to sleep so if you are looking on to stay up with your kids like, dont run it because or dont buy it because its much like dogs laugh",0
but its just kinda cheesy so Im going to just give it two out of five star rating a two so you know take that into consideration,0
Im going to do a movie review on Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End,1
"(umm) This movie is currently still playing in the theaters, and (umm) I just recently watched it",1
"(umm) I waited a while for (uhh) everybody to you know, because people wanted to see it as soon as it came out",0
"I waited a while for it to die down before I went and saw it because I figured (uhh) since this is the the (stutter) the third installment you know, usually it comes into third movies, which, (umm) Ive already done reviews on some third installment movies and, and they kind of sometimes lack",0
But when it comes to Pirates of the Caribbean the second one I didnt like,1
The first one I liked a lot,1
"The second movie kind of died off for me the way they, they killed Jack Sparrow",1
"And this movie starring the same characters, (uhh) (uhh) and Johnny Depp, (umm) Orlando Bloom and (uhh) Keira Knightley I believe (umm) for the names of the actors",0
"(umm) Its a long movie, its like two and a half hours maybe almost two to forty-five minutes",0
So and it has a lot of action in the movie,0
"It (stutter) did kind of almost too much action, it, I think it numbs you after a while because its got so much going on",1
"And (umm) you know, the the (stutter) kind of back and forth plot goes here, it goes there goes all over the place, theres a lot of things going on so if youre not paying attention youre gonna kind of, kind of get lost in it",0
And so,0
"But the, (stutter) but you know they did pretty good on the graphics",0
(umm) The CG is great,0
"And (umm) the storys, you know, it, it keeps you out, oh I kind of wish they would of, of (stutter) maybe split this movie up or shortened it or something",0
"Because this its just, its (stutter) almost just too much",1
"They try to cram everything all in at once and it, it just didnt it just didnt (stutter) cut it for me",0
"(umm) Theres some parts I liked, some parts I didnt, so if I was to grade it Id probably give it a C plus",1
(umm) I know the critics didnt give it a very good grade,0
But you know,1
"Hi, My name is Nalin and I will be reviewing for you Stephen Kings IT",1
So Ill take a closer look,1
So this is a movie about the (uhh) a clown basically as you can see on the DVD cover right here and (umm) this clown is (uhh) out to get children and (uhh) that that (stutter) is the basic plot of this movie and this movie starts out,1
"Im not even sure whether this is a movie or what but (uhh) this movie starts out in a town, in a small town and (uhh) it shows this clown thats been (uhh) really wicked clown and (umm) he takes under from farms and seven kids get together in (stutter) their childhood and (umm) then they want to reunite because this clown is bad",1
"So the basic thing about (uhh) naming this thing IT, the movie, is that the clown, they named the clown as IT",1
"Ill be reviewing (uhh) the movie Spider-Man Three which is currently in the theaters, which is the third and looked like the final, you know, these the Spider-Man trilogy but there might be more made with different actors or even a different director, its hard to say",1
"And you know I was pretty, I was looking forward to this movie you know quite a bit",1
"(umm) You know I was a big fan of the first so that they were done pretty well, you know, with Sam Raimi directing its pretty much, you know, the perfect choice, you know, for the, for the (stutter) movies in that, you know, he didnt take them too seriously, you know he knew how to joke around with the makeup, kind of, you know, goofy and kind of like booky and that kind of thing and it really worked for the (uhh) first two",0
"I mean they always had good villains with like Alfred Molina playing (umm) Doctor Octopus and, you know, (umm) that kind of thing",0
(umm) But for some reason the third one really fell apart,0
"(uhh) They had too many villains and it was just really hokey and it felt like they were just trying to do way, I mean, really it felt like it was two movies they tried to cram into one and (uhh) they didnt give enough time to relay anything",0
"(uhh) I mean Peter Parkers character, you know, was (uhh) even, you know, when controlled by the symbiote (umm) its just (uhh) its just kind of a big mess",1
I just really left the theater feeling just kind of (uhh),1
"And the more and more I thought about it, the more and more I just really hated the movie",0
"Its just, its a bad movie (uhh), you know? With bad characterizations",0
"The acting surprisingly enough was actually worse than the first two which is really saying something, you know, its probably the definitely the weakest point of the first two movies",0
"And (umm) its just a big puddle of, you know, mess",0
"Even the action sequences arent as good as (uhh) the first and the second one so I gotta say it purp (stutter), I will, dont know if I say it ruined the trilogy",0
"Well, it ruined the trilogy, I dont know if it ruined the first two movies for me",0
"Hi, I am doing my video premium for Wolfs Rain - Recollections",1
This is the fourth DVD in the series im xxx but completely unnecessary,0
It contains four episodes and each episode is it focuses on one of the four main characters retelling whats happen so far in the story from their perspectives,1
"The (uhh) video, the animation in the episode most of like most like (stutter) almost all if not all is rehashed in this animation is just (uhh) taken out from the previous episodes so they didnt even make the original animations because they are retelling the story thats already happened so they are just reusing all that animation",0
The audio is new but it doesnt tell you very much,0
Its just (uhh) pretty obvious stuff you know,1
Theyre basically saying this happened and this happened,0
It seems like they made this DVD just to fill a gap (uhh) during the time where they couldnt make new episodes I guess I dont know but its (uhh) pretty upsetting but this DVD costs the same price as all the other DVDs in this series when it has nothing new,0
"So, if youre a die hard fan and you wanna xxx and if you just want to watch everything in Wolfs Rain Wolfs Rain (stutter) (uhh) then you can get it but I wouldnt recommend it",0
Its (uhh) you know just get three then go on to five,1
"Hi, Summer Banks here and today Im reviewing for you, the DVD Vanilla Sky with Tom Cruise",1
Tom Cruise is in this movie with Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz,1
The movies is rated R for sexuality and strong language and is brought to you by Paramount pictures,0
Now I have to let you know Im giving this movie two stars,1
The only reason Im giving it two stars is because Ive watched it approximately five times and I still have absolutely zero idea what really happened,0
This is a thriller,0
"There are events that take place that you dont know if theyre real, if theyre not real",0
There are finales that arent really finales,1
There are beginnings and events that arent really there,0
Theres some that are there that you dont see til later on,0
I I (stutter) cannot explain this movie in any way shape or form because I simply did not understand it,1
"Now as for the shooting and the acting, it was fantastic",1
"The movie was acted very well and I was very comfortable in that regard but, the simple story line was too difficult for me to follow",0
"So, as I said, Vanilla Sky is receiving two stars from me and thats pushing it",0
Its probably more like one and a half,1
This is a review of the movie Spider-Man three,1
(umm) What a way to end the trilogy,0
"Lets see the first Spider-Man film was pretty good, half of it was at least",0
The second one was silly and this one was worse,0
"Not only was it excessively long and had way too many characters in it, (stutter) Spider-Man three just lacked substance on all levels I would say",0
Tobey Maguire (stutter) clearly didnt want to be doing this role anymore,0
Kirsten Dunst I dont know if she could ever act,0
She couldnt at the very least she wasnt acting in this film,0
"(uhh) The direction, it was Sam Raimi, I I (stutter) just dont understand",1
I guess something happened,1
"Like he used to be at least an interesting director what what (stutter) with like you know, the Evil Dead trilogy",1
"But, I mean, then again those were very campy films",0
"This is summer blockbuster so I dont know, maybe his artistic talent maybe just doesnt translate",0
But anyway (umm) plot was hopelessly absurd (umm) and uninteresting to boot and yeah,0
I I (stutter) dont even know why they introduced Venom,0
"He showed up and then bam, he was gone",0
Hopefully I didnt spoil it for anybody,0
"Anyways, for the positives about this film (umm) Stan Lee does another cameo, which was a little bit funny",0
This is a review of the movie Hostel Part two,1
"(uhh) Well, what to say about this film",0
"Surely, surely (stutter) wasnt hostile",0
"Hostel was, it wasnt scary, but it was gruesome and kind of had some dark humor to it and a fairly interesting plot",1
(umm) Hostel two pretty much rehashed the plot of one except it made it about women,0
"(uhh) going to the infamous hostel which leads to their demise, ultimately to their demise",0
"But (umm) Yeah, I was I just felt it was very rehashed",0
It Its (stutter) been done already,0
The violence in this film was exponentially worse I would say,1
"Not exponentially no, probably geometrically though",0
"It was worse, but at the same time it was very forced, almost pornographic is a term thats thrown around a lot that I agree with",0
Its an accurate description,0
And (uhh) I didnt care about any of the characters in this film unlike the protagonist from the first one so,0
This review is for the movie Dead Silence,1
I got this movie because (uhh) I like horror movies every now and then and it says from the writer and director of Saw,1
"I really liked Saw, I thought Saw was a pretty interesting original movie so I thought this would be good too",0
(uhh) but I was very disappointed by this movie,0
"There, its just its (stutter) theres a lot of stuff that doesnt make any sense and a lot of stuff that just seems to be there just for the the (stutter) sake of the story like wouldnt happen otherwise",0
"I mean I understand in movies that you have to suspend, you know disbelief for the sake of the story but when it, when it (stutter) there is nothing on it to hold on to, then it kind of truth or reality then it kind of just becomes nothing you know, waste of time",0
Thats kind of what this movie became,0
"And (uhh) as I was watching the extended features, they were talking about how great the sets were, how you know how, how (stutter) all the stuff they did was incredible and and I think they put more emphasis on the look of the movie rather than the actual movie itself and story line and everything else",1
"And another thing that I I (stutter) kind of realize why the movie wasnt that great cause it kind of didnt, really not make any sense to me",0
It really seem like it was going all over,0
"And it had an alternate ending and when I watched it, I kinda realized now the, the (stutter) actual, alternate ending kinda, could have made the movie go into two different directions and because they had two endings in mind, I think that they didnt really get a grasp on the actually theme of the story, what it should be from start to finish",0
"(umm) Like the great xxx said, if you have more than one ending for a story, youre in trouble and I think that holds true with this",1
"I wouldnt recommend it, theres really not anything scary in it",0
"They try to have little scary moments that you have seen in every other horror movie, you know, knock offs of of (stutter) the kind of scare tactics that other movies have used and they dont even do a good job with that",0
So I didnt find this movie scary,0
License to Wed,1
"I was, I was (stutter) really excited to see this movie",1
(umm) Im a huge fan of The Office and Jim was in it so I I (stutter) was definitely on board to see the movie,0
And (umm) its also got Robin Williams in it whos hilarious,0
"Mandy Moore, shes really good in in (stutter) the few movies Ive seen her in, but back to this movie",0
(umm) Let lets (stutter) go over the gist of the movie,1
"Gist of the movie is Mandy Moore and Jim, I dont know his real name, (umm) Ill just call him Jim for",1
{clears throat} Are are (stutter) getting married but in order to get married at a certain church they have to pass the (umm) reverends (stutter) marriage test thats to prove theyre compatible,1
And (umm) they have three weeks to do it in,1
And and (stutter) (umm) Robin Williams is the pastor and he he (stutter) puts them through tests,0
"And (umm) I didnt enjoy the movie, I I (stutter) really didnt, and I really wanted to",0
"Maybe it was because I had too much high hopes and (umm) I think Jim was okay in it, Robin Williams wasnt his normal funny self to me",1
"I dont know, maybe Im getting tired of him, but I mean, he wasnt all that funny",1
The funniest person in the whole movie is (umm) the little kid in the movie,1
"And (umm) I have no idea what his name is, but (umm) hes in some new movie coming out, Ive seen him in it, he was on Jay Leno the other night",1
"He was hilarious in the movie and (umm) the the (stutter) rest of the movie, you know, (hmm) it could me just going into the movie thinking its going to be too good but, I mean there were a couple funny parts but it just seemed like (uhh) like (stutter) they were trying to be funny",1
"Funnier, more than being funny",1
And (umm) Ill say on a scale of one to ten its maybe a four,1
Maybe a four,1
"Hello, my name is Mike and today I am going to be talking to you about the movie License to Wed",1
This is that new movie starring (umm) Robin Williams,1
"Basic premise of the movie, this couple gets engaged, wants to go and get married at horrible church but the new standards there require that the priest approve the wedding beforehand and the priest makes them go through all kinds of crazy stuff to get his approval",1
"Okay {sigh} so when you look at this movie, Robin Williams can actually be a reasonably funny guy but for him to be really funny in a movie isnt enough",0
"For it to be a good movie itself has to be funny, you cant just rely on the fact that hes a funny guy and thats what this movie does",0
"The humor in the movie is just horrible, the plot is not that good or well rounded",0
It just kinda feels like someone slapped it together and in the end you know having a big name comedian doesnt save you in the end,0
"So, License to Wed starring Robin Williams, one out of five",0
You may be funny on your own but you werent funny enough in this movie,0
This movie is an avoider,0
This is Dustin with a video review for a DVD and today were looking at Coach Carter,1
This is an MTV production DVD and its starring Samuel Jackson,1
"As you can see there hes the little dude holding, well, kicking the basketball or whatever you wanna say",0
"Basically he is a coach of a basketball team and theres all these kids that are like, troubled you know",0
"They come from like, bad homes (uhh) bad families (uhh) bad friends",1
"(uhh) Lots of drugs, gang things like that",1
You get the story,1
"(umm) Basically he teaches them that, you know, theres more to life than all these bad things and everything",1
(umm) Overall I didnt like this movie very much at all actually,1
(umm) I would have to give this movie a two out of five,1
"Very (umm) I dont know, stereotypical I I (stutter) feel",0
"(umm) I feel that you would just waste your time if you watch this movie, so I would recommend not doing it",0
"This is Dustin with a video review of A Cinderella Story, starring Hilary Duff, as you can see on this dudes back here",1
(uhh) Thats basically the best part of this movie is that it does feature Hilary Duff because shes pretty hot,1
"(uhh) But other than that, I mean this movie is (umm) {fart noise} not good at all",0
"(uhh) Its Its (stutter) like they try to make the story of Cinderella, the classic fairy tale, (uhh) into a modern day LA type story and basically, this girl, she she works like manual labor and all this and stuff and she has an email buddy and he ends up asking her to go to the dance with her",1
It ends up that this email buddy is like the coolest dude out there and stuff,1
"So she starts freaking out and basically you know, they get together they go to the dance",1
Aww its all perfect and all that,1
(umm) I would give this movie a two out of five,0
Its completely a chick flick,0
"I mean if youre a chick, maybe a four out of five, maybe",1
This is Dustin with a video review of the DVD called Legally Blonde,1
"Its starring Reese Witherspoon and basically this movie is about this girl who falls in love with this guy and basically thinks she need to go to law school to get him and of course, she goes to Harvard and (umm) as you can see, she doesnt really fit in by the cover",1
I mean she wears pink and dresses in stiletto shoes and everything and you know and thats not really the whole college scenes anyways,0
"But basically its about like you know, girl power and this stuff and like how blondes rule and all this and how everything goes her way because shes pretty",1
"(uhh) This movie is, I would give it a one out of five, it is garbage",0
(umm) They say two thumbs up (umm) theyre lying,1
On the back they say a feel good girl power comedy,1
Corbitt here reviewing Hostel: Part two,1
Hostel: Part two is currently in theaters and it is directed by Eli Roth who also directed Hostel one and Cabin Fever,1
Hostel: Part two is a very gruesome movie,0
(umm) that is basically about a online type site where people pay to go to these foreign countries and basically kill tourists for money,0
(umm) Basically its very gruesome,1
I wouldnt say its the best movie,0
"If youre a fan of the original Hostel, you might wanna check it out",0
But (uhh) Id actually think that its worse than the first one,1
"Like I said, its very gruesome and really thats the only thing the director tried to do is basically (uhh) make people squirm in their seats because of how gruesome it is and if youre looking for that kind of movie you might enjoy it",0
But (uhh) overall Im not really happy with it,0
(uhh) I definitely dont think its worth a movie (uhh) ticket,1
Spending all that money to go to the movies especially if youre going with someone else,0
"But (umm) if you have a chance to see it, check it out",0
But (uhh) overall I wouldnt really recommend it,0
Hello,1
(umm) I am reviewing Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,1
"It is the fifth movie in the series and {noise} it is its (stutter) probably one of the darker movies in the series, doesnt end on an happy note",0
"Hes back! (umm) Yeah and in this, I was very disappointed with this film (umm), Im a pretty big Harry Potter fan and I enjoyed the fourth movie pretty, yeah I enjoyed the fourth movie, (umm) but this movie, I would have to give it ten fingers down",1
"Yeah So, pretty much this movie fails on all levels",0
Emma Watson cannot act,0
Rupert Grint who is probably only one of the good actors in the series,0
(umm) He plays a lesser role,0
The special effects arent that great like the scene where they are flying on broom sticks towards (uhh) the order headquarters,0
You can tell it was shot from a flying vehicle over the water and not as someone following the flyers,0
"(umm) If you havent read the books, it will probably be really confusing since the director tried to cram everything in there",1
"I thought the Umbridge actress was pretty good, she was a bitch which is what I wanted (umm) but, the movie, it tried putting random scares for no reason and the special effects were alright but with the budget this film had and how high my expectations were, this film is very horrible",0
I would not recommend it,0
I would recommend instead you read the book,0
"This is Chobits disc three, Darkness Descends",1
(uhh) This is the third disc in the three disc Chobits collection and this one has chapter nine through twelve,1
(uhh) Each of them have four chapters on a disc,1
"(uhh) Hideki, beside himself with joy, is going on a date with Yumi",0
(uhh) Basically this is an anime movie,1
"If its not your kind of thing, then I didnt really like it, but I dont like anime",1
"(uhh) Ive also heard from people who do enjoy it, this is by far the worst of the three",1
"So definitely, if you really like the first two, maybe you should check this out",0
But Ive heard its really not very good,0
"(uhh) I definitely didnt enjoy it, as somebody whos not into anime",1
"But if thats your thing, then I guess you could try it out",0
"(uhh) I would definitely say if you do think youd be interested in this, that you should rent it before you buy it, because personally I think it would be a waste of fifteen dollars",0
"Im doing a review for Evan Almighty which is a movie currently in theaters starring Steve Carrell, Morgan Freeman and Lauren Graham",1
"And its about a modern day (uhh) Noahs Ark story and as as (stutter) and as you can imagine theres if you try to put the Noahs Ark story in modern times, theres gonna be some wacky hijinks that follow and obviously there are as (uhh) Steve Carrell becomes (uhh) Noah both in physical appearance and in his (uhh) duty to (uhh) build a huge ark in the middle of a populated American town, so",1
"(umm) Morgan Freeman plays God, as he did in the Bruce Almighty movie",1
"(umm) I like Morgan Freeman a lot, I dont think these roles give him much to do but its good seeing him and he he (stutter) plays a pretty convincing God",1
(umm) Wasnt a big of this movie,0
"This is a review for a movie currently in theaters called License to Wed, starring Robin Williams, John Krasinski and Mandy Moore",1
"Its about a young couple who are getting ready to wed but before they are allowed to do so in the church (uhh) the priest, played by Robin Williams, requires that they go through his (uhh) training classes for (uhh) to make sure theyre ready for marriage",1
(umm) I primarily went to this movie because Im a big fan of The Office and I like (uhh) John Krasinskis work on on (stutter) that show,1
Im not a big fan of Robin Williams at all,0
I find him (uhh) pretty annoying to be honest,0
So I was hoping that (uhh) John Krasinski would balance out my dislike for Robin Williams and (uhh) Mandy Moores an attractive lady so that was a plus,1
Im no you know fan of her acting or anything so I was kind of indifferent towards her,0
But the movie itself was alright,1
It had a couple of funny scenes and a couple of funny lines but it wasnt it wasnt really worth going to,0
I didnt (uhh) Robin Williams was grating as usual,1
"Hello, (umm) Sarah here talking about Spider-Man Three, one of the first of several extensions of trilogies or other series of the summer",1
And (umm) basically the beginning of the end of original entertainment,0
And (umm) I think this movie was a perfect representation of that,1
"It was satisfying in the laziest way, it was (umm) just basically the minimum that you might expect from an action movie",0
"The fight scenes were weak, the characters were completely underdeveloped, (umm) basically the story was all over the place and everything that was interesting about it was barely touched on at all and it just seemed like they put almost no effort into making it because they knew that because it was a trilogy and a successful series that they didnt have to actually try to get people to go to the theaters",0
And it did break the box office records,1
"And (umm) I think thats pretty pathetic, I mean maybe its just trying, I mean it says that more and more people are going to the movies and less and less people actually care about what theyre watching and taking in",0
I just saw Pirates of the Caribbean Three (uhh) At Worlds End and (uhh) I was a bit disappointed,0
I thought that movie was terrible actually,0
"It was probably the worst out of all three, and the second one wasnt that great either",0
"(uhh) First of all it was way too long, two and a half hours",0
"It was just boring and theres too much story to it, not enough action, like I would get up and leave just cause it was so bad and yeah",0
I did not like it at all,0
Had some really good actors in it but (uhh) still Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom and Kira Knightley dont really do it for me,0
"(uhh) The action scenes in that movie stunk, the story of that movie was pretty bad too",0
(umm) Also the ending of that movie sucked too,0
"Also like the second one, just kind of left you there like (uhh), what happens? So you definitely know theyre going to make a fourth one but (uhh) I dont like that kind of thing and (uhh) I think Pirates of the Caribbean has gone on way too long and they should probably stop making it after this next movie or just stop in the middle of making the next movie and realize that their movies suck",0
"This review is on the (umm) The English movie, Ill Be There",1
(umm) I wasnt too impressed,0
"This is, I didnt even watch the whole thing to be honest with you",1
(umm) This is guy girl named guy named guy named (stutter) Craig Ferguson Charlotte Church,0
"(stutter) Ive seen Craig Ferguson before, (umm) but not not not (stutter), (uhh) Charlotte Church",1
"Its about a girl who her dad was a rock star or is a rocks (stutter), was a rock star and she wants to sing as her career, his old assistant comes to help her",0
Its an English movie (umm) Dont really get the humor in it,0
"Dont really know if its a humorous movie or a serious movie, I cant really tell",1
(umm) This is the widescreen version,1
Its rated PG-thirteen,1
"(umm) If I remember, it was actually going to, I didnt watch the whole thing, but it was going to be fairly long",0
(umm) Not impressed,0
Would not going to give this one a very good rating (umm) Its okay,1
"Its borderline okay, its kind of bad, actually almost",1
"Hey, you all",1
"Hows it going? My name is Jordan, and Im going to be reviewing a movie today",1
And that movie is called Crank,1
"Now (umm) I dont know about you all, but I have seen tons and tons of advertisements for this movie",0
"And when I saw the advertisements, it looked like a really action-packed kind of (uhh) suspenseful movie that I thought I was really going to enjoy",1
"However, I got into the theater, and I started watching the movie and everything, and everything was extremely cheesy",0
"(uhh) Basically, its about this guy who gets injected with this kind of serum or something that makes it so he cannot let his heartbeat drop below a certain rate and, or hell die",0
"So, basically, the entire movie, hes trying to keep his heartbeat up while trying to, you know, get back at the people who did this to him, say goodbye to his girlfriend, you know, tell the people that he, that he knows that hes dying and things like that",0
But (umm) a lot of the movie didnt really make sense,0
There was a lot of plot holes,0
"I wouldnt really recommend it if youre kind of (uhh) if you like to think about things and, you know, if if (stutter) youre looking for just sheer blow-up stuff and, you know, things going fast and things blowing up, then I would definitely recommend seeing this movie",0
"However, if youre looking for a sophisticated action movie that make sense, then I would not recommend this",1
(umm) The acting is only so-so,1
I didnt really care for the main actor,1
I never really cared for any of his movies,0
They all seem the same to me,0
"(uhh) But (umm) but (stutter) overall, I was not very happy with this movie",0
I would not recommend it for people to go out and see it,0
"I kind of wish I wouldnt have seen it, because the previews were better than the actual movie",1
The previews showed the best parts of the movie,0
The previews showed the biggest action part of the movie,0
And so (umm) I wouldnt really recommend it,1
"So if youre looking for a good action movie, try to go see something else because this one is just not worth it",1
So definitely stay away from Crank,0
"But (umm) that sounds kind of funny, but the movie, stay away from Crank, the movie",0
"My old roommate back in college, (uhh) in an attempt to share common and bond with me would sometimes give me, you know, (umm) box sets of anime that he especially enjoyed and Ive hung onto them over the years because I cant throw things away and one of said animes, you have to say it like an angry samurai ANIME, is (uhh) Ranma One Half",1
"You just, you just (stutter) had Anma One Half, now you have Ranma",0
"And the plot of this delightful little anime is that, oh I watched this, its just been a few years",0
(umm) Whatever,0
Their jacket thing sucks,1
"Hes a dude when he gets splashed with cold or hot water, I forget which one temperature of water, turns into a hot girl",1
Hijinks ensue,0
Also theres like seven-thousand love interests and the girl that hes obviously courting (stutter) in traditional Japanese style is a complete and utter not a good person,0
"She (umm), you know, blames him for things that arent his fault and always catches him in compromising situations and I really think that Japanese cartoons at least, I cant say about TV, but Japanese cartoons are like ten, fifteen years behind (umm) my own obviously superior countrys TV",1
(uhh) Just because we stopped relying as much on the old sitcom formula of girlfriend finds guy doing something that could look bad and of course they never talk it out and they always assume the worst and (stutter) oh man it drives me crazy,1
"And this is like four seasons or something of that, every episode and its just no good",0
(uhh) It has a really ridiculously catchy poppy bubblegum pop theme though,0
"&gt;&gt; Well, hello from Davos again.",1
"Hi, Im Carolyn",1
Today Im reviewing the DVD Dune,1
Dune is quite an interesting DVD,1
"As it says on the front, A place beyond your dreams",1
A movie beyond your imagination,1
Its definitely way beyond my imagination,1
"And the beginning started out really pretty good and then it just got kind of too crazy, with this weird music that was, like, super electric guitar or something, but it just got a little bit crazy",0
So it is like science fiction,1
It is rated PG-thirteen for language and (uhh) a little bit of (uhh) kissing in there,1
(umm) Lets see,1
"It is Frank Herbert, classic science fiction epic was made into a movie",1
"The director is if I can find it here for you, (uhh) David Lynch, who did The Elephant Man and Eraserhead",1
"And basically, its a story about (uhh) this intergalactic warrior",1
So youre out in space,0
It starts off being narrated by one of the (stutter) space princesses or whatever,1
(uhh) and (uhh) Paul is the messianic rise to leadership,1
"So this guy named Paul, hes born of this woman who was only supposed to have daughters, but she has this son and hes supposed to, well, this other land that has this (umm) the spice, and this spice is what everybody wants in this intergalactic (uhh) you know, in this (umm) galaxy and this space (stutter) world",1
"And so, (stutter) on this land, on this other planet where the spice is harvested, they know that (uhh) the messiah will come",1
So its got a little religious undertones in it,1
"And then it just goes kind of kookie and just keeps going on and on, with cool (uhh) special effects and (uhh) powerful performances and images",0
So its a little over the top for me,1
(umm) It did win Best Supporting (stutter) Actress in nineteen eighty three and (uhh) its a classic,1
"So if youve never seen Dune {laughter} and you want an adventure {laughter}, then you could go out and get this movie",1
My review today is (umm) the movie Surfs Up,1
The animated movie about surfing penguins,1
"(umm) This movie starts out as a very theres a very young penguin, hes wanting to break free from where his family is",1
He wants to go out and see the world and do some surfing,1
"Along the way, before he before he (stutter) leaves town, this surf guy comes into his town and gives him a necklace",1
Basically getting him started into the surfing world,1
he he (stutter) in turn wants to go out and surf,1
And be a big surfing star,1
"So he, I dont exactly know what, where exactly he goes, but he runs across this (uhh) this big surfer guy thats supposedly (uhh) dies, and he learns to surf, surfs really well, wins a competition",1
And everything turns out okay in the movie,1
This review is for a film currently in theaters called Spider-Man three,1
(umm) Hugely popular film,1
(umm) Big giant movie blockbuster trilogy,0
(umm) So this is where I stand with the Spider-Man movies,0
Actually I didnt like the first one,0
I thought it was kind of boring and hokey,0
(umm) Really enjoyed the second one a lot,0
I thought it was more mature,0
I thought it was deeper and had more of a message,0
"(uhh) I really liked Doc Ock (umm) He was a great villain and I really enjoyed Spider-Man two and actually, (uhh) it made up for Spider-Man one and I really couldnt wait for the third one to come out",0
And so I go see Spider-Man three and once again Im sorely disappointed,0
"(umm) Its hokey, its shallow, its, its not at all what youd expect",1
"Especially since (umm) they introduced Venom in it which had so many possibilities for it to be (umm) you know, another dark film, another more mature film",1
"But (umm) Topher Grace from That seventies Show actually plays Venom, which I thought was a stupid choice",0
(umm) He makes a really terrible Venom,0
And they turn the movie just into just basically a big joke,1
"(umm) You dont care at all for the characters, you dont care at all for the story line",1
"Its really boring and (umm) I dont know, like Ive forgotten most of the things in the film just because I didnt care about it that much",1
So I was sorely disappointed and (umm) I probably wont be go see the fourth Spider-Man because they completely lost me now,1
"Hello, this review is for Star Wars The Empire Strikes back",1
This is my favorite of all the Star Wars movies,1
"(umm) Its really dark kind of movie (umm) everything kind of starts going bad for the rebels, they get driven off their ice planet in the beginning",1
"Theres a giant battle right starting off, (umm) these giant walkers, the AT-ATs come, and they attack everything, and they blow up their base and the rebels have to run",1
"And then Luke Skywalker goes to be trained as a jedi (uhh) and he meets Yoda, and Yoda teaches him all about the force and how to use it and how to become a true jedi, and not succumb to the power of the dark side",1
And then in the end hes forced to confront Vader,1
Vader traps his friends and and (stutter) lures him into a trap (umm) to try and take him to the emperor,1
"(umm) Really intense movie, really cool",1
"Billy Dee Williams comes and (uhh) makes his appearance as Lando Calrissian, of course Carrie Fisher is in it",1
"Frank Oz does the voice of Yoda, who Frank Oz has of course done Muppet movies and voices for all sorts of people",1
It was really great,1
"And Harrison Ford returns as Han Solo, and this is just (uhh) a really awesome movie",1
Check it out if you havent seen it,1
Hello Im Matthew and Im here to tell you about this DVD Movie {cough} this is easy money starring Rodney Dangerfield (umm) he is a comedian actor (umm) that did comedy back in the eighties and nineties and recently passed away a few years ago,1
"Hi, today Im gonna (stutter) review the movie I recently saw in theater, its Live Free or Die Hard",1
"This is an action adventure thriller that was just, I mean theres no way you could be bored in this movie",1
I thought it was an excellent movie,1
"It stars Bruce Willis, he plays the part of John McClane",1
This is the fourth in a series of shows,0
"I had never seen the other shows, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one",1
"Its (umm) rated PG-thirteen, its a little over two hours long and its basically about this old-fashioned cop who (umm) is used to doing things the hard way or the normal way as opposed to the younger generation who thinks everything has to be done through computers",1
"But theres a young guy played by Justin Long, and if you cant recognize who he is, hes in the (umm) Mac and (umm) PC commercial",1
"He plays the Mac and I kept thinking the whole movie you know, who is this guy",1
But thats who it is,1
"He plays a young computer hacker who accidentally helps the (stutter) wrong people get some (umm) information and helps them try to destroy the USs (umm) whole computer system, everything going and John McClane comes to help you know, fix this problem and they work together and they solve it",1
Its a very high action movie and you know you could go along with most of it,1
"They had some helicopters and some freeway scenes that were just, you know, a little bit outrageous at one point",1
But (umm) I mean as long as youre not expecting it to be totally realistic and you know youre in an action movie thats fine,1
"It was an excellent movie, Id give it (umm) five stars because I was not bored one minute",0
I was on the edge of my seat and I thought it was very entertaining,1
"Im holding Cheaper by the Dozen DVD set starring Steve Martin, Bonnie Hunt, Tom Welling, and Hillary Duff",1
(umm) This movie was put out in two-thousand-three and it was given to (umm) to me as a gift but but (stutter) you can purchase it at Walmart for fifteen dollars,1
"(umm) This movies okay, its not my favorite",1
"(umm) Steve Martin (uhh) and Bonny Hunt do a great a job acting, Steve Martin is hilarious as ever (umm) but it wasnt the best family movie in the world",1
"There were some things in there that just didnt really stick with me, I I (stutter) kind of thought they should have left it out for a family movie",1
"(umm) But (stutter) all the kids in the movie are great actors and great actresses, they really have a good cast, just think the writing could have been a little different",0
"So if youre looking for, you know, a clean family film this isnt really it",1
(umm) Its rated PG,0
(umm) Again you can buy it at Walmart for fifteen dollars,1
(umm) Ive also seen it at Target so you can buy it there for about the same price,1
"So (umm) anyways, this is Cheaper by the Dozen",1
"Im holding the hilarious movie The Princess Diaries, starring Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews",1
"This film tells the story of Mia Thermopolis who is a gawky and odd teenager who lives in San Francisco yet finds out that she is princess to the throne of Genovia, a European country",1
(umm) Julie Andrews stars as the queen and who comes and tells Mia the secret that was kept from her her (stutter) whole life,1
This movie was purchased at Walmart for fifteen dollars but you can also find it at Target or online at DisneyDVD dot com,1
(umm) This is a great movie,1
I think its great for girls and I think its great for teenagers,1
(umm) My brothers even watch this,1
"So if my brothers watch it, you know its a good movie",1
(umm) It is rated G and I give it five stars because I just think its wonderful,1
"So, highly recommend it",1
"Alright this review is for Dead or Alive, the movie (umm) based off the video game",1
"(umm) Its kind of like a, its halfway of a parody, halfway serious movie",1
(umm) It doesnt it doesnt (stutter) try to be too serious but it also isnt a comedy or anything like that,0
(umm) Its a martial arts movie,0
(umm) Type of movie that basically stars (umm) four four four (stutter) of the people from the game,0
(umm) and they its basically just an excuse to have martial arts and CG in a movie,0
"(umm) Basically they just screw around (uhh) go around beating people up, getting in fights (umm) showing off, doing the ninja thing and then (uhh) theres a little bit of a plot thrown in",0
But its not nothing believable,1
Not even very easy to follow,0
(umm) Yeah theres a lot of holes in the plot,0
"(umm) Overall, Id say its probably not worth it to see this movie",1
(umm) I I (stutter) Yeah this is one of those movies where definitely video games should not be made in the (uhh) movies,1
Too hard to follow,1
"Not they dont make great movies, not enough plot in them",0
"(umm) So yeah, and the acting, overall, not very great",0
(umm) The fight scenes were all right,0
"Theyre semi decent, but still (umm) nothing, nothing (stutter) good",0
(stutter) I probably wouldnt even rent this movie,0
Hey expo,1
"(umm) I have a movie review for you today, and its not very good",0
(uhh) The movie that Im reviewing is Cashback,0
"(umm) Not much to say about this movie, it had had (stutter) a pretty weak story line I think",0
(uhh) Characters were a little bit (umm) shaky,0
"I dont know, it it (stutter) didnt seem like it, movie itself didnt seem like it was together too well",0
"(umm) I dont know, it was a lot of just unnecessary things that just made it kind of played out and annoying",0
(umm) I wouldnt pay to see it again,0
(umm) Really wasnt that great,0
"Not family movie (umm) as you might know its rated R, so obviously its probably not a family movie",1
(umm) But even if youre by yourself or with some friends or with anybody you probably still wont like it,1
"Its not, I dont like it",0
Its not that good,0
"But (umm) you might like it, I didnt",0
(uhh) One out of five maybe,0
"Yeah, one out of five",0
"(umm) So (umm) Cashback not too great, so go see it for yourself and see what you think (umm) but Im going to give it one out of five",0
So there you have it,0
"HI, Im here to review (uhh) American Wedding DVD",1
(umm) This is the (umm) third movie in the (umm) American Pie series,1
(umm) Its about (umm) about Jason Biggs character (umm) Jim,1
He (umm) he decides to marry this girl (umm) Michelle who was in the (umm) the (uhh) very first movie and (umm) movies definitely not as good as the (uhh) first one,0
(umm) Second one wasnt that great either,0
This one also doesnt really make the cut,1
(umm) Its just a lot of (umm) crude crude humor,0
"(umm) I mean like I said, its not a good movie",0
(umm) I definitely wouldnt suggest it for anyone,0
"(umm) I dont know, I didnt really like it that much",0
"(umm) I mean it does have its (stutters) a few funny points, (umm) but theyre scattered few and far between",0
So I mean I definitely wouldnt suggest this,0
Its definitely not a kids movie,0
Hi Im here to review (uhh) Drumline DVD starring Nick Cannon,0
"(umm) You may know him from (uhh) from All That when he was (uhh) when he was younger, and (uhh) now more recently hes been (uhh) starring in his own show on MTV called (uhh) Wild and Out",1
"(umm) Nick Cannon is pretty funny guy but (um) you know when it comes to playing a serious role as this, (uhh) hes, he doesnt (uhh) doesnt really cut it very well",0
(umm) Hes not a very good movie,0
(uhh) I mean it is good if you like watching the (um) the whole band and everything,1
(umm) Like whole black college (uhh) band battles,1
"(uhh) But I mean, really the movies only good for those scenes where theyre actually doing their (uhh) their battling",0
"The (uhh) the dialog isnt that great, the (uhh) storyline is is (stutter) pretty predictable, pretty cheesy you know",0
"(uhh) So I mean I wouldnt suggest this unless you were just watching it just to watch the (uhh) the bands, but I mean you can do that any you know college football game",0
"So all in all, dont get this (uhh) Drumline DVD",0
This DVD I have here is entitled the Italian Job,1
(umm) Its a very exciting film starring Charlize Theron and Edward Norton,1
"(umm) I really loved it, its kind of an action movie and usually I dont like action movies that much",1
"There is a very exciting scene where theyre all driving Minis, Mini Coopers, and theres a bunch of stuff in it and theyre going through all these little alleyways and down stairs, places Minis wouldnt drive and its really cool",1
The boys thought that car was cool so (umm) its a great movie if you like that car,1
Its very exciting,1
(umm) {clears throat} I think theres been great reviews (stutter) about this movie and its very (umm) fun to watch with friends and I have always had a fun time watching it,1
"Hi, this is Dave and this is my review of The Matrix Revolutions",1
"This is the third chapter, third and final chapter, in the Matrix trilogy and I would say by far my least favorite of the three",0
"(uhh) The first movie, I thought was really good",0
I enjoyed it,0
(uhh) it was very original,0
"The second movie, not so much",0
(uhh) It still had some redeeming qualities like I did enjoy the action sequences quite a bit,0
But story wise it was a big disappointment over the first one,1
"And Matrix Revolutions, the third one, really gets even worse",1
(uhh) The action sequences I thought were didnt even hold up,1
They were completely unbelievable and over the top and just not really that fun to watch,0
(umm) The story got even worse I thought,1
It just I dont really know where they were going with it,0
(umm) But I would say if youve seen the first two movies already you might as well give it a watch just to finish up the trilogy and be done with it,0
But otherwise (umm) I really think you could pass on this and not be missing anything,0
"{noise} Hi, Im here to review the (umm) House Party DVD",1
(umm) I didnt really like this movie,0
(uhh) Its a old old-school movie,0
"(umm) Its about (umm) this guy, Kid, he (uhh) hes played by Christopher Reid",1
"{noise} Hes basically a (umm) a nerdy kid, comes to (uhh) comes to live in this in a rough neighborhood and (uhh) hes trying to learn the ropes, trying to be cool",0
"And (uhh) then he meets this guy, Play",0
And they become Kid and Play,0
"And they (uhh) you know, try try (stutter) to make it up in the world",0
"And they (uhh) try to throw a big house party, like have lots of fun and everything",0
"And theres some people who (umm) who are trying, you know, like spoil their fun and everything",0
"Of course, his father is over protective",1
"Trying not to, trying to get (stutter) him focused on school and everything",1
"And (umm) you know, it wasnt that that (stutter) funny of a movie",1
"But (umm), like I said, I didnt really like it",1
"Of course, its a old movie, so that, that (stutter) could be it also",1
"So, I mean, all in all I wouldnt suggest getting, getting (stutter) this DVD",1
Its definitely not worth the money,0
"Hi, this is gonna be a review of the movie of I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry and this is one of those movie when I saw the trailer, I was all happy seeing to see that movie because it looks so hilarious in the trailer",1
"Well, unfortunately all the funny parts were apparently in the trailer (umm) and I say that only because there were other funny parts in the movie but it was all those like obvious funny parts",0
(umm) It was the type of humor that would appeal to an eight year old boy but thats what I should expect from an Adam Sandler comedy,1
(umm) There were too many obvios jokes and I felt there was a lot of stereotypes,0
"(umm) I felt it went from a lot of stereotypes to a lot of trying to force an after school special kind of movie on this (umm) and (umm) it just felt too unbelievable from going from stereotypes to trying to send a message so (umm) it, there were some funny jokes in there",0
I just felt like all the jokes were already used in the trailers so that was a little disappointing to me,0
It was a funny movie,1
(umm) It wasnt as funny as I had hoped it would be,0
"(uhh) Its one of those movie that you should definitely, you would be better off when it come out in DVD though it definitely wasnt worth going to see it at the movie theater",0
"This is Wild Wild West and it stars Will Smith, Kevin Kline and Selma Hayek",1
"And while Im actually usually a pretty big fan of (umm) Will Smith movies because I think hes, you know, hes a good actor",1
But (uhh) you know even he couldnt save this movie,0
(umm) This was (uhh) basically just not a good movie,0
I mean the plot was terrible,0
(uhh) A lot of the like you know a lot of the little gadgets that they through into the movie and you know were just bad ideas,0
(umm) I mean I guess its entertaining to watch once or once you know like ever and (stutter) just to see how bad it was,0
"But (umm) I mean (stutter) you think with actually a you know a somewhat decent cast that they pull off a you know, better movie but they dont",0
(umm) (uhh) Yeah (uhh) Theres a whole bunch of special features,0
"Theres a you know behind the scenes documentaries, Will Smith and Enrique Eglasias (uhh) music videos, director commentary and you know they threw in a whole bunch of stuff but you know it doesnt really make the movie you know it doesnt make the movie any better",1
So I give this movie a two out of five,1
"(umm) Like I said Im a huge fan of Will Smith and (uhh) (stutter) basically everything hes been in, but (uhh) this is just (uhh) this wasnt a good movie",0
Im gonna do a review on The (stutter) Best Little Whore House in Texas,1
"Dont ask me why I got this, but I thought it would be (umm) fun because it has a character that plays Gomer Pyle in it, and Burt Reynolds, Dolly Parton, and I thought it would be a good movie",0
"Dont get me wrong, it it it (stutter) has its moments, but its an older movie",1
(umm) Im not sure when it was even made,1
(uhh) It says a release date,1
"Anyways, I dont know (uhh) Pretty much its its (stutter) about this cop, and theres this whore house and they want to get it shut down and the cop is sleeping with the owner of the whore house and you know, she wants him to be on her side and he, it its (stutter) an its a weird movie and yeah it has funny moments and stuff but it just it just (stutter) doesnt keep me involved throughout the movie because I I (stutter)just know that I its just weird and Ill probably wont watch this again and I cant recommend someone watch this because its just, maybe for the (uhh) someone thats older than me that has seen it in the past or watched shows like that in the past",0
"They they (stutter) might enjoy it but (umm) I, no, I didnt like it",0
"(uhh) This is The Matrix Revolutions (umm) the third installment in the Wachowski brothers matrix trilogy, and definitely the worst",0
(uhh) I would give it probably two stars out of five,0
(uhh) I only bought this movie to complete the series,0
(umm) It goes way too heavy on the Jesus references,0
"(umm) Theres just Neo in there, trying to save the world again and stuff and just way too heavy on the Jesus references, I hated that",0
"And what made the first two movies great was like, the kung fu and hand to hand action",1
"And in this movie, its all done with machines, and its just not nearly as cool it it (stutter) gets rather stupid",0
And I I (stutter) just didnt get why they didnt stop after the second one,0
"It (uhh) like the agents once again are multiplying, big surprise, and {sigh} its just all these machines going on and (stutter) just not the human emotion that were, that was in the first two",0
"Hi, this is my review of the movie The Chronicles of Riddick",1
(uhh) This movie I really bought just on a whim,0
I had seen the original movie starring Riddick (uhh) which is Pitch Black and I really enjoyed that movie so when this came out it looked like just a big epic movie featuring (uhh) the same characters,1
So I figured itd probably be pretty good so I picked it up,1
"(uhh) Visually, its really (uhh) pretty incredible movie but the story was kind of a let down",0
Its kind of just an instantly forgettable action movie,0
(uhh) I wasnt that impressed with it and I probably would not have bought it if I had seen it before I picked it up,0
"(umm) So I really cant recommend it although I did enjoy the previous movie, Pitch Black, which you might wanna check out",0
"(umm) Yeah, so I would say for the most part, you can skip this",0
"But (uhh) if you do wanna check it out, just keep in mind that (uhh) the original was rated R I believe and this is an unrated version which (uhh) would definitely be inappropriate for children",0
Alright (uhh) this is going to be a review of a foreign film Old Boy,1
This film comes (uhh) from Korea and it is highly regarded as (uhh) just a great film overall,1
"(uhh) Im not, I cant go into the plot or the storyline without giving anything away, without giving (stutter) any spoilers away, but I can set up the story",1
(uhh) Dae-Su is a Korean man who one day gets locked up in this hotel room,1
He is basically jailed for fifteen years and he doesnt know why,1
"And the rest of the film involves him trying to find out why he got locked up, who did this to him, and he tries to see if he can exact revenge on the person who (uhh) who jailed him for fifteen years",1
(uhh) this a wonderful (uhh) masterpiece,1
"If youre not into foreign films, you probably will be after watching this",1
"(uhh) I recommend watching it in the dubbed, (uhh) not the dubbed but the subtitled version (uhh) just to get the the (stutter) entire effect, the entire feel of it",1
It is done great,1
"(uhh) the actors are great, storyline is great",1
"Hello, my name is Emma and today Im going to review this DVD that I got",1
"It is the Blair Witch Project Two, Book of Shadows, and Blair Witch Project One, I know a lot of people didnt really like it, but I thought it was pretty good",1
"It scared me a little bit, which is rare with a scary movie",0
But this movie has absolutely nothing to do with The Blair Witch Project One,1
"You know, none of the same actors, hardly even the same plot, and a lot of really, really random weird stuff that makes absolutely no sense like, you know, I wouldnt even be so angry about it if they had called it something different because its clearly not The Blair Witch Project",0
I dont even think it was directed by the same person,0
I got this DVD at Best Buy for about (umm) twelve dollars I think,0
"You know, I hadnt seen the movie yet",0
"I like The Blair Witch Project, thought Id like this too, but I didnt",1
It was awful,0
I would not recommend buying it,0
"This is a review for Black Sheep, which came out this year in New Zealand",1
(umm) I only watch this movie online but I really thought this plot was kind of (umm) was very (uhh) not well thought out,0
"(umm) It was basically about (umm) It was basically about (uhh) a man named Henry Oldfield and he returns home to his brother Angus Oldfield Oldfield(stutter), who is doing giant experiments on sheep",1
(umm) Henry Old Oldfield (stutter) was coming back from a psychiatric institute which (umm) was treating him because of his fear of sheeps,1
And (uhh) he came back to Angus and he found out that Angus had (umm) released a genetically engineered sheep that turned them into that turned the sheep into blood thirsty sheep,1
(umm) Basically it was just Henrys (umm) nightmare (uhh) came to life,1
"Overall, (umm) it was just basically this movie was basically about how Henry Angus had to avoid these deadly sheep which (umm) this one sheep turned more thousands into blood thirsty sheeps",1
So basically they had to find a way to save New Zealand and avoid these sheep,1
"(uhh) Personally I thought this movie, the plot was kind of lacking and it wasnt very fulfilling in my eyes",0
"Hi, today Id like to review Shark Tale on DVD, and this was another of the many animated movies",1
"(umm) This one features voice actors such as Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Renee Zellweger, Angelina Jolie, Jack Black and even director Martin Scorsese",0
(umm) This was an entertaining enough movie,1
It its got a pretty generic story about some fish and it (umm) features a real musical sequences to popular seventies songs,1
But overall I found it to be just kind if generic and it was just made to capitalize on the popularity of movies like Shrek or Toy Story,0
Plus it just used the voice acting cast to gain popularity even though its kind of distracting in that you just kind of hear the celebrities but not the characters,0
(umm) DVD does have a good bit of special features (umm) that kids will enjoy like bloopers and interactive things about the music and the special effects and interviews with the cast,1
"So (umm) overall I think Id recommend this for kids cause I think theyd probably enjoy it, but otherwise (umm) I wouldnt recommend it because its just pretty generic and lazy and not that interesting",0
Hi,1
This is a review for the (uhh) Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,1
"The catchphrase for this movie is mothers, daughters, the never ending story of good versus evil",1
I dont actually see how this applies to this movie,0
(umm) I didnt really find that this movie was very entertaining,0
(uhh) It lacked really any kind of (uhh) draw that some chick flicks might have for men,0
"(umm) This movies definitely just for girls and it (uhh), you know, you need to have a Kleenex box alongside with you",1
"It does happen to have some very tragic and downright (umm) depressing moments in the movie, (uhh) especially with the fact that the mother and the daughter that are the main characters, Sandra Bullock and whatever her moms name is, (umm) they (uhh) have this rift between them and the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, which is the sworn lifelong friends of Vivi, who is Sandra Bullock, (uhh) have decided to have this intervention so that they can bring mother and daughter back together",0
(uhh) It seems like an impossible task but of course because a chick flick it obviously works out,1
(umm) The title (uhh) obviously the sunflower that you see on the cover here is a little misleading cause the movie overall is rather depressing,0
"My review now is for the movie Nancy Drew, by Andrew Fleming",1
"Well, Andrew Fleming is the director, and yeah",0
"So those who are of course childhood fans, I am as I suppose",0
"I read the Nancy Drew books as a child, and yeah I thought they were really good",0
"And when I heard there was a movie coming out I was skeptical, which is not too surprising",0
"Movies from books are often, well, rushed",0
"Of course, there are exceptions",0
"Lord of the Rings, for one, and yeah",0
This one was hmm,1
I know Nancy Drew doesnt really make her appearance on the big screen quite as well as she does in the books,1
"In the books shes a very interesting character, but yet on the big screen, yeah she loses it I feel and most of the magic was in the imagination, well thats what it seems to be because (stutter) I just couldnt get into this movie",0
"Thought it was quite fast paced and yeah I just, I couldnt enjoy the movie",0
Which is sad because I was really looking forward to it,0
"And the characters try their best to act, but yeah, xxx the story just (stutter) was missing something, that kind of Nancy Drew magic and well it kind of broke my heart",0
"So if you also loved Nancy Drew as I did as a child then, well, you could try and watch this but be prepared for disappointment",1
Go in with low expectations and you might enjoy this,0
"Hello ExpoTV, today I have another great (umm) review for a movie currently in theaters",1
"Live Free or Die Hard and obviously this is starring Bruce Willis and of course I forget the rest of the characters I always forget names, but Live Free or Die Hard is exactly what it sounds like",1
"Its a mantra for an action movie and if you love the rest of the Die Hards and youve seen them and you have Die Hard movie nights like Ive had, youre gonna love it",1
Its basically the summers action hit before Transformers came out,0
"But Live Free or Die Hard basically if youre like me, if you love to see stuff blowing up, cars flipping in the air, shoot them up, everything like that, if it Bruce Willis is crazy and hardcore as usual, (umm) just like the rest of them, it definitely wont disappoint",1
"(umm) Its definitely something that is worth the money you got, youve got (stutter) to see the rest of the Die Hards",1
"I would definitely, I cant wait until it comes out on DVD and we get out the collection and have another movie night",1
"(umm) Its a perfect edition, and basically if you love the rest of the Die Hards dont even hesitate, go out and see it",1
Hello Expo TV,1
Today I have another great movie for only in theater review for you and that is Nancy Drew,1
"Nancy Drew, to be honest, I really didnt like at all",1
(umm) I took my younger brother and sister to go see it and they loved it so I guess its more of a preteen (uhh) adolescent kid movie than for (umm) young adults and adults,1
"(umm) I would say if youre babysitting and you wanna get the kids, they wanna see a movie xxx like that, Nancy Drew (umm) would be good for that",1
(umm) Its basically like the Nancy Drew books,1
The girl shes a detective and (umm) and shes really good,0
(umm) And I mean shes solving mysteries,0
Shes a little bit of an oddball,1
"She doesnt really fit in (umm) with the current times, the current kids",1
Which is kind of interesting,0
I though (umm) they kind of set her out as sort of like the books are Nancy Drew,1
(umm) She was kind of old fashioned and all the way she dressed and she is very conservative and compared to the newer kids and I thought that was an interesting contrast which the younger kids I dont think would pick up on,1
"But (umm) really I mean you have as much depth as a kids movie has and I mean, its basically you know a kids spy series",1
"So, I mean for younger kids I think its great but for older audiences, I mean again its a good family movie but (umm) definitely not a blockbuster hit",0
(uhh) The movie Derailed based on a book by James Sigel,1
(umm) I picked up because I really liked the book,1
"However (umm) I should have known with Xzibit being one of the featured actors that the acting and the, the general dialogue was gonna be awful",0
(umm) Xzibit has failed to impress me with his acting ability as most rappers who attempt to (uhh) succeed in the movie industry tend to do,0
"(umm) The first twenty minutes, half hour, work pretty well and then the movie just loses all coherence",0
"(umm) If youre looking for a mindless thrill this may be it for you, however it is lacking a little on the thrill part and all the Hollywood cliches are here, everything from the fake ending (umm) to the way that the characters are portrayed",0
"(umm) The actings subpar, the screen the screenplay (stutter) is disappointing and the directing is awful",0
"Hi, this is my movie review of the movie (umm) Twenty-Eight Weeks Later and (umm) first of all, I have to say, I saw the first movie, Twenty-Eight Days Later, and I thought it was actually quite intriguing despite being really nasty",1
(umm) Im actually quite intrigued with the kind of like modern-day zombie movies,1
Ive seen almost every one of them from the pretty good one to the mediocre one to the really really bad one,0
"Basically, zombie movies, (umm) nowadays zombie movies are based on one concept",0
"Now it doesnt matter if they call it differently, theyre the same",0
"They basically have some type of virus that they have and then they bite people and then they infect people and then they all have you know the walking dead Im gonna bite people (umm) virus, and Twenty-Eight Days Later explored that (umm) and it was set in England and this movies also set in in (stutter) the United Kingdom and its basically that they sealed off after the first attack and (umm) America and the United Nations are opening up Great Britain, theyre cleaning up the mess (umm) because they think all the zombies have died or has been fire bombed and exterminated, so they go (umm) try to bring, resettle Great Britain with the people who survived and people who escaped",0
"And the story starts out with a family, and (umm) the fathers reunited reunited (stutter) with (umm) the brother and the sister, and basically (umm) theyre really shattered that you know their mom died",0
(umm) but one of the twist is that (umm) the movie is that they find the mom and (umm) thats where the story begins,0
(umm) I think I think (stutter) the movie was its okay in terms of plot,1
"I think the mom coming back and shes being really you know advertised in the trailers as (umm) being really important person, and she is a very important person (umm) in this movie",0
"I think one of the things that kind of bothered me is that when they brought the character back, the way they did that was really annoying because they relied on the children (umm) the characters as being really idiotic",1
They relied on a lot of chance events that feels really like forced and feel very unrealistic,1
"Its like youre looking at the movie, youre like, screaming at the movie like what the heck, like, thats so stupid, like no normal human with normal intelligence would do that, so its like, when you, (stutter) theres certain parts, like in the beginning where youre just like how could they do that and it just feels so that like the film maker ran out of ideas so they used some cheap idea to, you know, create some drama to (stutter) bring the zombies into the film",1
"Hi, this is my movie review of the movie, Sunshine and this is a movie that stars Cillian Murphy and (umm) Chris Evans as people who from the Earth (umm) who realize that the sun is dying and they are trying to send a payload to the sun to rejuice the sun",1
(umm) I think the movie has been a little bit overrated,0
(umm) I didnt like the movie at all,0
I think it wasnt as good as (umm) I dont think its as good as like any science fiction movie,0
"I dont think its as good as those in space, you know movies, because I felt not only was the production really cheap, (umm) I I (stutter) just didnt really believe that you can have a whole spaceship full of people, never (umm) showing like you (stutter) no gravity scenes and that was, but that was not the majority of the problem though",0
"The majority of the problem was the movie didnt really have a good plot (umm) as advertised as being cool you know and directed by the same person who did twenty-eight days later and you know, stars Cillian Murphy whos supposed to be a good acting",0
"But you know what, doesnt matter all of those, it doesnt matter if movies look beautiful",0
"I think what matters the most is the movie has a good plot, it has a feasible plot you know, its got maybe like a message at the end thats not too cliche (umm) and the movie failed in every aspect in my opinion",0
I didnt think it was visually stunning,0
I didnt think the story was interesting,0
"I didnt even, in the end of the movie, I was like {sigh} relieved that the movie was done you know",0
I couldnt wait to not watch the movie and (stutter)I mean I just wanted to fast forward and see what happens in the end,0
"And in the end it was very predictable it was like, and there was, basically there were some parts of the movie where they questioned like you know (stutter) how mentally you know ill the people on board the (umm) spacecraft and you know, thats thats (stutter) a really old concept and its been overdone in so many movies and I just feel like thats just one of the most boring film Ive seen this year so I absolutely dont recommend it",0
"If youre that big of a fan so Cillian Murphy maybe, but overall the movie had like, (stutter) it was just like really limited",0
I dont really think they got creative,0
I thought because they were on a spaceship it really limited like the story telling and it was just really bad,0
Its not good science fiction,0
"Its not, you know, good in space or at least not good action not, its just (stutter) bad",0

Im here to review this movie and its called Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,1
And its rated PG-thirteen,1
"And its about (uhh) martial arts fighting and (uhh) believe it was really based in China and about (uhh) these two master fighers, and theyre all their abilites and the storyline that goes with its real interesting",1
"And (uhh) this (uhh) young woman here, she (uhh) comes out as a, you know another master fighter but she tries to hide it",1
"But the stories the storys (stutter) okay and the (uhh) fight scenes, you know if youre really, if youre into martial arts and that kind of thing this is a good one, I mean its really good choreographed fight scenes",1
But (uhh) it was (uhh) kind of strange and I didnt really understand (uhh) a lot about it but,0
"(uhh) If you enjoy the martial arts arts (stutter) and understand, you know a lot of the things that are behind the martial arts, this will be an interesting one for you to see but",0
"(uhh) For me it was a little bit boring, and (umm) (uhh) but you might, you might (stutter) see something different in it, so",0
Im here to review this movie called Millennium,1
And it stars Kris Kristofferson,1
And its an older movie,1
"Its been out for quite a while, but its on (uhh) DVD now",1
And (uhh) its rated PG-thirteen,0
And this is (uhh) about time travel,1
And about (uhh) people way in the future that (uhh) come back to our time and different times and (uhh) the the (stutter) things that they do,1
"I dont want to mess up the story for you, but (uhh) its interesting because, you know, its about futuristic things and time travel, but (uhh) the storys kind of, kind of (stutter) nothing",0
"You know? Its kind of boring and its so far out there and (uhh) its just kind, its just really unbelievable",1
"But if you like the idea of time travel and that kind of thing, you might enjoy this, because it gives you a little different idea about, you know, how things might be",1
"So (uhh) its been, its an older movie, like I said",1
"Its been out for a long time, but you can find it on DVD now, and (uhh) your prices will vary",0
"So (uhh) try it and (uhh) you may enjoy it, you know, more than I did",1
Hi,1
My name is Kaitlyn,1
Im doing a review on the movie Taxi with Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon,0
Okay,0
Two thumbs down,0
This movie was pretty bad,0
"(umm) Not only was it cheesy, but the storyline {sigh} was just dumb",1
"(umm) Supposedly, USA Today says its hilarious, real belly laughs, but, yeah, it was funny, but it was funny because it was so stupid",0
"(umm) I dont even know why we own this video, to be honest with you",0
"(umm) Maybe it was my husbands, but {sigh} I would not pay money to see this movie or buy this movie",0
I dont even know why they paid money to make this movie,0
"I mean, it was pretty bad",0
"I like Queen Latifah and I like Jimmy Fallon, but they just dont do very well together, I guess",0
"So, anyway, thats my review of this movie",0
"Alright, the film Im reviewing right here is a Paramount (uhh) movie",1
"Its (uhh) Jackass The Movie, Special Collectors Edition",1
This is a great movie,1
I think this is one of the funniest movies Ive probably seen in a long time,1
"(umm) I dunno, its a compilation of a whole bunch of stupid stunts by the MTV gang, Johnny Knoxville, Steve O, and all those guys",1
Its really funny,1
"Its really stupid, so you have to have an open mind because theres a lot of male nudity and (uhh) just absolutely retarded stuff so",1
"Id say its really good, and you should see it only if you have a very like, youre not squeamish or anything like that, so yeah",1
"I put that warning out there, not for younger kids",0
This is R rated and (uhh) a lot lot of crazy stuff that your kids will try to do if you dont yeah so dont let them see this at all,1
"But (uhh) yeah for me hilarious, funny",0
Watch it with the guys,1
Watch it with anybody,0
"Its hilarious, good college film",1
may also be required,1
"In negotiation with police and other stakeholders, you can identify most evidence-based treatments to apply the crime problems",1
All stakeholders should then probably agree on the division of responsibilities for the entire project,1
"So, making it clear in terms of whos responsibility it will be and perhaps trying to seek that undertaking at the beginning of the project so its clear for everyone",1
"And then, theres opportunity too, to do some research identifying effective treatments for similar crime problems in other areas or jurisdictions as well",1
The Victoria Police can support applications by providing a letter from the relevant local area commanders,1
You can even speak to your local crime prevention officers or other police as well,1

"Hi, this is mom of three for Expo TV",1
Today Id like to review the Disney DVD Hercules,1
This film was originally released in nineteen ninety seven,1
Its rated G and its ninety-three minutes long,0
"It follows the story of Hercules who has god parents, but he was raised on earth",0
He never fit in,0
"He has this abnormal amount of strength and he doesnt know where it comes from and he finally finds out that his dad is Zeus, but he has to be do a true heroic act before he can go and live with the gods in a temple",0
"He enlists the friend, the help of his friend (umm) Pegasus, (stutter) his friend Phil, rather, to help him do this",1
"But all this time, there is a villain of the the name of Hades, whos trying to come along and make it so he cant do his heroic deed",1
He uses Meg to try to get him derailed from his mission,1
"Hercules is very trusting and even though Phil does not trust Meg, they dont know whats happening",1
I found this film to be one of the worst Disney movies,0
"It, I dont even know how it got a G rating",1
Its very violent and its not one that I would recommend,1
The only bonus feature on the DVD is the making of Hercules feature,1
Today Im doing a review for Weekend at Bernies Two,1
(umm) I really liked the original Weekend at Bernies so I thought I would like this one,1
"Basically after the first movie ends and they spend their weekend with Bernie (umm) these two guys (uhh) go to their bank and find out theyre fired (umm) and they also find out that Bernie, when he was alive, had stolen two million dollars and its in the Virgin Islands",1
"So they have to go back to the Virgin Islands and, and find the money",1
(umm) This is the movie playing in the background,1
"(umm) Its its (stutter) just not as funny as the first one, I like, I liked the first one a lot better",0
"In this movie theres this, you know, in the Virgin Islands theres this lady who brings them back to life and, I dont know, I just thought that was kind of lame",0
Hello expo my name is Jocelyn,1
I have to tell you about a movie that was fantastic,1
Its Ratatouille and it was really a great animated movie,0
This movie is so good because its very real,1
"The reason its real is because the animators were actually asked to go to France and film everything culinary, just the way it would be cooked so that it could be reproduced in this movie",1
That is what is one of the things that makes it so great,1
"Remy is played by Patton Oswalt and he does a fantastic job of you can even see the expressions of Remy, but and thats quite odd, even when hes running or when hes thinking about what hes cooking",1
That really translates so there has to be some great animators to do that,1
"One prepares the food, its just as it is, was (stutter) or is to be prepared, the way that the culinary chefs do to prepare food",1
"He wants to be a chef although and, since hes a rat that sort of holds him back because society frowns on that",1
"His family is appalled because he, he (stutter) wants to be a chef because they cant seem to figure out why he just doesnt want to sniff garbage",1
"So as they would have it, he ends up in a store in France, and from there theres some hilarious wonderful authentic and funny, funny stuff that is just so right on with food network and the way cooking should be",1
"Its just a wonderful movie for all ages, so if you want to see something thats very entertaining with a lot of laughs and even get educated about how to cook, with a (uhh) profession such as a gourmet chef from France, youll love Remy",1
Hello my names Karen and Im gonna review for you the movie Elf,0
(umm) Honestly right up front Ill tell you that Im not a person that likes to watch a seasonal movies out of season,0
(umm) Elf being a Christmas movie,1
(umm) This one I dont mind watching any time,1
(umm) It stars Will Ferrell,1
(umm) I really enjoy watching Will Ferrell in this movie,1
(umm) He plays elf,1
And he has (umm) (umm) slipped into Santas bag in an orphanage so hes raised raised (stutter) in (umm) the North Pole as an elf,1
"(umm) He finds out that he was adopted, he is human and this (umm) takes him on a journey to meet his father",1
(umm) Its funny as usual (umm) Will Ferrels just (umm) out of the box on this one,1
(umm) (umm) And also stars (umm) Bob Newhart,1
"(umm) Havent seen him around for a while so hes very, funny too",1
(umm) The whole movie is a Christmas theme about an elf who (umm) learns that hes human,1
Hes on the track to find his father,1
(umm) And then he also (umm) is gonna teach some people about (umm) spreading (stutter) Christmas cheer all around the year and what the true meaning of Christmas is,1
(umm) I think (umm) this movie is (umm) (umm) PG,1
"And it is (umm) ninety-five minutes long, so its not a very long movie but even though it is a Christmas I suggest you watch it any time of the year",1
"Hey, Summer here for ExpoTV",1
Today Im reviewing for you a movie that I truly dislike,0
The movie is eight millimeters with Nicolas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix,0
"Now, the basic premise behind this movie is Nicolas Cage is a cop, and hes trying his best to find out what happened with a six-year-old crime",1
So he is reinvestigating an old crime,1
"And in the process, he finds (umm) an integrated trail of mystery, murder, thrillers",0
And all of it is being captured on eight millimeter film,1
"(umm) I did not like the storyline of the movie, first of all",1
"(umm) I I (stutter) liked even less the fact that there was actually on film violence, rape, and murder",1
"It, it (stutter) was on film, and then (stutter) they showed you clips of these films",0
"And I I (stutter) wasnt, you know, thrilled with that",0
"I mean, there can be, Ive watched many, many psychological thrillers that were really, really good",1
And they didnt need to show this,1
"I understand that the basis of the movie is the eight millimeter film basis, but it could have been done in a different way",0
"I mean, the the (stutter) people that were involved in this movie were the writer that wrote this was the same writer that wrote Seven",0
"And (uhh) Joel Schumacher, he he (stutter) was the one that directed this movie",0
And and (stutter) theyve done such great movies that that (stutter) were so successful in the past without the usage of of (stutter) this type of film and footage,1
So I didnt like eight millimeter,1
Im going to give it one star because I just dont like the the (stutter) basis behind how the movie was filmed and the way that the eight millimeter film was integrated into the footage,0
"So, eight millimeter",1
"If you want to watch something like this, you go on with your bad self",1
I do not like the film,0
And I will not watch it again,1
Its rated R,0
And it is with Nicolas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix,0
One out of five stars,1
MS. NULAND: We have seen some statements from the regime side.,1
"We’ve also seen some statements from the opposition side, Free Syrian Army, saying that they will abide by the UN Security Council and the UN Special Envoy’s call for a ceasefire tomorrow beginning for the Eid holiday and continuing into Sunday.",1
"What we are hoping and expecting is that they will not just talk the talk of ceasefire, but that they will walk the walk, beginning with the regime.",0
And we will be watching very closely.,1
"QUESTION: Right, but does it really mean anything if the government hasn’t agreed to a political transition?",1
"Hello, this is Ron Paul with your weekly update for August 8th.",1
The Super Congress created by the recent debt ceiling increase deal is a typical example of something nefarious attached to a bigger bill that is rushed through Congress without giving Members ample opportunity to consider the full ramifications.,0
This commission may turn into an early Christmas present for the well-heeled lobbyists of K Street.,1
This is because the commission presents a huge opportunity for lobbying firms to sneak their clients pet projects and issues into whatever legislation is created by the commission.,0
The fact that automatic cuts to defense are named if the committee deadlocks simply signals to the military industrial complex to bring their A game to the lobbying effort.,1
One red flag I am constantly aware of in my position as a Congressman is that highly complex and convoluted legislation frequently has dangerous provisions hidden in the fine print.,0
"Elaborate legislative packages force lawmakers to take the bad with the good, and often if they refuse, they are accused of voting against the positive provision - never mind the blatant Constitutional violations in the bill, the spending, the waste, and the unchecked expansion of government.",1
"I dont usually have to read too much of a bill like that before encountering something unconstitutional, or simply unwise.",1
Then I have to vote no.,1
"That doesnt seem to be the case with a majority of legislators, unfortunately.",1
"In order to ram through one special interests favorable treatment or giveaway, a certain amount of horse-trading is done.",0
The end result is mammoth bills with myriads of unrelated provisions that favor those with the best lobbyists at the expense of everyone else.,0
"The creation of a 12 member committee to preside over $1.5 trillion in spending decisions, and the exclusion of the rest of Congress also means lobbying firms can focus their efforts on an anointed few, which is certainly more manageable for them than having to deal with the entire Congress.",0
"Every cut considered will, of course, have a recipient on the other end whose livelihood is being threatened.",1
The probable outcome is that any cuts realized will be more a function of lobbying prowess than the merits or demerits of the actual programs on the chopping block.,1
Make no mistake - I am enthusiastically for cutting government spending.,0
The goal should be to eventually reduce government down to the size and scope of its constitutional limitations.,0
"However, the process of getting there must also be constitutional.",0
"Concentrating such special authority to fast track legislation affecting so many special interests to a small, select committee is nothing more than an unprecedented power grab.",0
"Hey there Expo tv, Summer here and today I have a review for you of Silent Hill",1
Now Silent Hill the video game was truly a scary video game,1
"I played this game and and (stutter) I was left basically with night terrors, I had no idea what I was gonna do, I couldnt sleep I was scared",0
So when I watched this movie I was ready,0
I was ready I slept half the day I was ready to be up all night frightened all out of my wits,0
And I watched the movie and was left just stunned,0
This is the least scary movie I have ever watched in my entire life,0
The movie from beginning to end does not even begin to employ the scariness of the video game and I know thats what they were trying for,0
"And I I I (stutter) didnt like the storyline, I didnt like how they explained the things that were happening in Silent Hill",1
"And I just didnt like the movie, so this is Silent Hill",0
"Its two hours long, its rated R for strong horror and violence, gore, disturbing images, some language, and I would not watch this movie again",1
I was very upset with myself for having purchased the movie and basically being left with something Im not gonna watch ever again,0
"So, Silent Hill gets one star from me, it did not scare me, there was no ha moments or anything of that sort it was just plain old fashioned bad",0
"Bad try, bad attempt with some gore thrown in",0
Not a good movie,0
"Whats up expo tv, goob here",1
(uhh) Today Im going to review Man of the Year starring Robin Williams,1
Its movie about Robin Williams playing a (uhh) late night comedian who decides he wants to become president,1
"So he runs for president and due to some computer glitches, (uhh) he wins",1
"(uhh) Thats Christopher Walkens in it, Lewis Black, (umm) few other people",0
"Its rated PG-thirteen (uhh) I would rate it NS for never see, because it is extremely boring",0
(uhh) I found myself just losing complete interest halfway through the movie,0
"(uhh) They, its like they abandoned the premise",1
"He gets elected and then suddenly he goes from a comedian to a real politician and it gets real, it just gets boring its not funny",0
"(uhh) Even the part where hes running for president is not funny, its just, theres hardly any jokes",0
"And its weird because I like (uhh) the real life character that hes, you know, portraying, John Stewart or Stephen Colbert",1
You know I love those guys but,0
"Suddenly when Robin Williams takes over in the movie its just like wow, hes not boring, hes not funny like they are",1
Its just not interesting,0
"(umm) I dont even remember how it ends, I got was so bored with it I was, wasnt (stutter) even paying attention",0
I started doing other stuff,0
(umm) And it was a struggle just to make it all the way through it,0
"So if you want to, you know, watch a bad movie and bore yourself to death, check out {laugh} Man of the Year",0
"Hi this is a review for the movie Blue Collar Comedy Tour, its playing behind me and actually what this movie is about is you have (umm) the four stars of the movie and thats Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, Ron White, and Larry the Cable Guy, and its actually a movie about their comedy shows (umm) and with little bits and pieces mixed in its like their stand up routines and than some ins and outs between it",0
"(umm) Unfortunately I didnt think that this was the funniest movie, so I guess what it really comes down to is this movie is sort of like it takes stand up comedians doing their act you put it into a movie and ya throw in some separate parts where their you know youre going into sidelines of of (stutter) whats going on and thats kind of what this movies about",0
(umm) Unfortunately it falls pretty flat for me,0
Its rated (umm) PG for some sexually related type of humor,1
I want to tell you about a DVD,1
(umm) Its Gosford Park,1
"Now this is, you know, award winner",1
The cast is just incredible,1
(umm) Helen Mirren and just everybody,1
"I really, really, really wanted to like this movie",1
(umm) I am not a fan of it,0
"I bought the DVD basically because (umm) I heard it was really, really good, it got a lot of good ratings but I was not, Im not thrilled with it at all",0
(umm) I found a lot of the acting to be quite pretentious and it was (uhh) supposed to be a mystery and I pretty much figured out who was gonna die and who did it (umm) well before the movie (stutter) was even halfway through,0
I thought it was kind a heavy handed storytelling,0
But its very pretty to look at,0
(umm) The costumes are great,0
The acting is for the most part pretty good,1
"Theres a few people on there who was, I thought was a bit ham handed with their acting",0
(umm) I really cant recommend anybody buying this film because its not something you want to watch over,1
"Its one of those oh, okay, Im done with this type of movie and (umm) so I really wish I had (uhh) maybe previewed it, or someone had given me an honest review of it",0
Cause I just found it (umm) boring,0
Honestly it was boring,0
"(umm) and Im a fan of British mysteries, a big fan of British mysteries and of British (umm) {noise} in the countryside type of shows so I was very unhappy with how bad this one turned out to be",0
"Hi Expo friends, this is Jill",1
"Id like to take a minute to tell you about one of my favorite movies, the silliest Ive ever seen",1
"My family loves it, especially my four year old, it is called Dinosaur",1
This is a Disney movie and we love it,1
This movie (umm) stars many different (umm) characters we have here a family of lemurs,1
And this family of lemurs raises a dinosaur named Aladar,0
And Aladar (umm) is the only one of his kind left (umm) his egg was in an unfortunate accident,1
All of the eggs in his nest were destroyed which left him by himself,1
The egg was taken by a big pterodactyl like bird and dropped into several different situation by different animals and what not and ends up in this tree and the lemurs find him,1
And this movie is about Aladar living with his family of lemurs,1
They go through many many different adventures and trials including (umm) a comet that comes and hits the Earth and their home island is destroyed but they end up moving to another one,1
"And (umm) we just love it, its a great story and theres Aladar when hes just a baby",1
"(umm) We love it, I cant say enough good things about it",1
"There are though a couple, two or three scenes that are extremely loud and intense and may scare small children",1
"(umm) But other than that, its just great, we love it",1
"Once again, this is Dinosaur by Walt Disney, the colors on the movie are fabulous, the story is great",1
We watch it all the time,1
"As the world has become more integrated economically and the relationship between economics and politics has become tighter and tighter and more interesting over time, I think this has been one of the really interesting growth areas.",1

"My name is Jesse, Im 33 and Im from Pensacola, Florida.",1
Im a basketball player from an early age.,1
I’m here to share with you my testimonial about the jump manual and how it helped me to increase my vertical.,1
Before I discovered the jump manual and started using the jump manual workouts I was pretty much an average jumper.,1
"I could reach the backboard jumping off of One foot with Two hands and I could also touch the rim when jumping off of One foot with One hand but still, I was nowhere close to dunking.",1
and I started looking for ways to improve my vertical beacsue that just wasnt OK with me.,1
I wanted to be a jumper that people would want to gather around in the gym and watch him dunk.,1
I wanted to be able to catch alley-oops and throw the ball down like a hardcore proffesional basketball player.,1
So I started doing some research because I just wasnt happy with where I was and I knew that I had to do some research to find a program or to find something that could really help me improve my vertical so that I’ll be able to dunk.,1
‘cause this was my dream.,1
and I did some research online and I found the jump manual.,1
and I knew right away that this was going to be the program for me.,1
I knew that this gonna be the program that would take me to the next level.,0
About the program... when I started the program immediately I noticed gains in my vertical.,1
and I didnt measure my vertical before I started using the jump manual but I’m using the rim on the basket as a gauge to how high I’m jumping and how much I’m improving.,1
and before I started using the jump manual I was barely reaching the rim on a good day jumping off of One foot.,0

” The attitude and the description are all bound up together,1
"Now, maybe you have opinions and reasons for those opinions that you feel justify using this word",0
"But it might also be the case that you don’t actually think there’s anything wrong with having casual sex, or wearing certain kinds of clothes",1
"So, you might want to think twice about using a word like that",1
"Because when you use it, you’re signaling a specific attitude to other people",0
"So if it’s an attitude you don’t really hold, and one you don’t think others should hold, you should take care not to spread it through your speech",1
Now let me make just one more point,1
No one is telling you what you should or shouldn’t say here,1
"Hi, Im John Green, and this is not Crash Course: World History because were taking a week off",1
"However, we do have four episodes of World History left",1
"After that, we will be done",1
We will be done learning about the history of the world,1
We will have completed it,1
We will know everything that there is to know about world history,1
"Stan has just informed me that, apparently, there is more world history than just what we talked about on Crash Course: World History",0
Thats disappointing to learn,0
"He also says that some stuff happened today that we havent covered, and that stuff will happen tomorrow, and et cetera…hhuuhhh",1
"It just keeps happening! Anyway, speaking of Stan: starting in a few weeks, Stan is going to be hosting a Crash Course miniseries on intellectual property and copyright law, which is hugely important to all of us who care about making things and art and the quality of internet, so Im very excited for that",1
"Also, theres going to be Crash Course: Economics",1
"Adrian Hill &amp; Jacob Clifford will be teaming up to teach you economics so that you can understand, you know, why you are oppressed by the system of capitalism",1
Apparently Stan says that I cant say that,1
So that you can understand why the system of capitalism has been so beneficial to you,1
Apparently Stan says I also cant say that,1
"Thats why Im going—Im going to, to learn as well",1
"As for me, in the coming year Ill be popping into Crash Course videos here and there, but I have this other job, writing books",1
"Come to think of it, its both an intellectual property problem and an economics problem",1
"So I, Im going to try to write a book in the coming year, so you wont see quite as much of me, but enjoy Crash Course: Economics and Crash Course: Intellectual Property",1
Stan says that I have to leave the frame now so that he can enter it,1
"Bye! Stan: Hi, Im Stan Muller, and Im a real person",0
Im very excited that this April Im going to spend a few weeks teaching you about intellectual property,0

Second you can use your controller to protect your tank and home,1
Most controllers allow you to connect float switches to make your own auto top off operated by the controller,1
There are a few nice aspects to this,1
"One you can put a float in much higher where it is less likely to have issues as a third fail safe, controllers like the Apex also have leak detectors which detect spills and can turn off pumps and notify you",1
Lastly advanced controllers also have the ability to monitor salinity so it can also turn off the top off pump if the salinity were to get too low,1

Hi Omaha Chiropractor Dr. Christine Zorad.,1
The article today is from the Doctors Resource on my website.,1
The title is The Sugar Industry Makes Headlines. The sugar industry may have a shady past.,1
"JMA Internal Medicine and the New York Times recently reported on in the nineteen sixties, the sugar industry trade group (which is now known as a Sugar Association) paid off some Harvard scientists to downplay the effects of sugar on heart disease.",0
Theres a link below the video so click on that and you can read the article yourself.,1
Any questions you can call me at 402-210-8490 Im available to help you.,1
In the office we talk about foods of course.,1
Sugar is one of the things thats on the list of any healthy diet to eliminate or at least reduce added sugars to foods.,1
I encourage you to become a label reader and everything that you buy thats processed may have some sugar in it.,1
"So that would be one way that you could start reducing how much sugar you take in, would be to read your labels and just choose something different.",1
Im a proponent of real food and whole food and to make more of your food at home from scratch.,1

But recently a friend of mine was having a lot of success with Forskolin,1
And actually before trying Forskolin I had never taken any weight loss supplement,1
"But it was pretty obvious that this was working well for Anette, and she has a similar body type to me so I figured, why not give it a try",1
"Ive been taking it for 9 weeks now, just over 9 weeks",1
And Im down 13 pounds,1
And honestly I feel so much healthier,1
The biggest difference I think is my appetite,1
I dont have the same urge to eat like I did,0
I just feel a lot better,1
"I dont believe Forskolin is some magic pill, because its not",1
You still need to develop good eating habits,1
But there is no doubt that it has worked really well for me to control my appetite,1
So I would definitely recommend giving it a try,1

"Hi, Im here to review the movie The Babe starring John Goodman",1
(umm) This tells the story of Babe Ruth from his (uhh) rough beginnings as a incorrigible little boy dumped by his parents into a Baltimore orphanage,0
"(uhh) While he is at (stutter) orphanage, his life is pretty miserable as the kids tease him for his body type and (uhh) the brothers (uhh) the religious order back then, believed in corporal punishment and got away with it",1
(umm) He grew up to be a strong athlete,1
(umm) Was signed by the Baltimore Orioles,1
"(uhh) When he showed a little bit of talent, he was sold to the Boston Red Sox, who eventually sold him to the New York Yankees",0
"(uhh) Leading to the one of the great curses in baseball, the curse of the Bambino",1
Where the Red Sox didnt win the World Series for ninety-some years,1
(umm) But I find while the story of Babe Ruth is (umm) a a (stutter) very good story of a young man making something of himself (umm) the portrayal by John Goodman,1
"Babe Ruth was not a fat pig, slob",1
He was a gifted athlete,1
He had a barrel chest and spindly legs,1
We get the impression of him that he was this behemoth his entire life because most of the pictures we have of Babe Ruth are from his later years in life,0
Hi {laugh},1
Im here to review the movie The Door in the Floor starring Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger,1
"(umm) This is a very disturbing melodrama about a {sigh} (uhh) estranged couple, I guess, I mean they still live together but they are (umm) very distant from each other",0
Jeff Bridges plays a childrens author and in the beginning of the movie he hires a summer intern to help him,1
(uhh) The young man is probably colleged age,1
He comes into (uhh) to try to help Jeff Bridges but like I said Jeff Bridges character is very bizarre and Kim Basingers character is very bizarre,1
"(umm) This movie goes on to attempt to explain their weird behavior (umm) but it is, there are some very disturbing scenes in this movie and it is (uhh) kind of difficult to understand and then really wonder why it was made",0
"Hi, Im Liz and Im here to talk about The Great New Wonderful",1
"Its not that great or that wonderful, actually",0
"The thing about The Great New Wonderful is its an independent movie, but independent movies thats been around for a while",1
"And they cant trade on cute and quirky anymore, they need to have some meat to them",0
Theres not a lot of substance to this movie its just sort of following a trail of people that are sort of distantly connected to each other through other characters in the movie and theres not a lot of payoff at the end,0
"(umm) I think some of the story some of the (stutter) storylines are tired out, theres theres (stutter) a psychiatrist whos driving his patient crazy you know, by analyzing him too much",0
"I mean we never we never (stutter) heard that joke before and (umm) theres just strange things that dont seem to really mean anything or make any sense, and I think weve moved past that, especially independent film needs to have more to it than just, oh look at all this chaos",1
"Yeah life is chaos, life is boring we know that",0
"It needs to be something some art to it, and theres not a lot of art to this movie I dont think",0
"(umm) Youve got youve got (stutter) a great cast, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Tony Shalhoub, Edie Falco from the Sopranos, Stephen Colbert, obviously the Colbert Report",0
"(umm) Colbert Report, sorry",0
Its its (stutter) Theyre all good in their individual ways and yet it doesnt add up to much,0
"And I think thats the problem this movie, it doesnt really leave you with anything",0
"So, not recommended",1
Today what Id like to review is the movie Michael Clayton starring George Clooney as Michael Clayton,1
(uhh) Id like to state that this is Michael Clayton who is the fixer of (uhh) court cases and not Michael Clayton the wide receiver for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers,0
You go into it thinking its a football movie (uhh) youre definitely going to be in for a little surprise,0
This movie I did not enjoy whatsoever,0
It was extremely long and boring to me,1
"It was like a courtroom, a courtroom drama type movie which I definitely would not recommend, but thats just my taste, you might enjoy it",0
So basically the story is about this guy named Michael Clayton who is a fixer and I wouldnt really say that he enjoys his job but I definitely think hes good at it,0
And hes got some family problems,0
(uhh) Hes divorced,0
Hes not doing so hot (uhh) cash wise in the beginning,0
"(umm) This movie, I dont know, I I (stutter) kinda I I (stutter) started to zone out because the movie seemed like it lasted so long",0
I had to look it up online cause I couldnt even tell you,0
It said its two and a half hours long,0
Honestly when youre in the theater its going to seem like about six to eight,1
The movie never ends,1
"Its like it drags on and its one of those movies where you really have to be thinking the whole time, so when all youre thinking about is god when is this gonna end? its hard to concentrate on the movie, which is why I got really confused towards the middle and the end",1
Started off okay but I think the movie got progressively worse,0
Hi expo TV this is Vasili and I am going to be reviewing Fred Claus,1
"I have to say even though I knew I was going to hate it, I was not proven wrong I mean it was a really horrible movie",0
Vince Vaughn plays Santa Claus Nicolas Claus brother the quote on quote black sheep of the family and apparently due to some saint mythology the family and spouses of a saint do not ever die or grow old so Vince Vaughn is preserved even as its hundred of years later he appears to be the same age and hes dating Rachel Weisz who I have no idea why she was even in the film,1
"I though she does a lot better films than this sort of one and even though its a horrible, holiday film I maybe this could be good but no it was bad",0
"The jokes werent funny, they were really cliche, you know a lot of elf jokes and anyway I just dont recommend it",0
"Hi, ExpoTV",1
"This is Vasily, and I am going to be reviewing Mr",1
Magoriums Wonder Emporium,0
"And after just seeing a horrible movie for a class, I thought, Maybe Ill go see a better movie, maybe Mr",0
Magoriums Wonder Emporium will be better,0
"But {laugh} I have to say, it was, like, five-hundred-thousand percent worse",0
I have no idea what that movie was about,0
"You know? I think it was trying to emulate Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, but it really just didnt make sense",0
"It was just a very imaginative, very boring movie starring Dustin Hoffman and Natalie Portman",1
"And, you know, Natalie Portman, I like her usually",0
I dont know why she did this movie,0
"And Dustin Hoffman with a lisp, you know, is not a pretty sight",0
So I dont think this movie was good for kids or adults,0
"And I think everyone will be really, really bored",0
"So, unfortunately, I have to give it a zero out of ten",0
It was the worst movie I think Ive ever seen in my whole life,1
"Hi Expo TV, Id like to review a movie currently in theaters that I saw",1
"This was the movie Fred Claus, starring Vince Vaughn",1
(umm) This is pretty much your typical holiday movie,0
I wouldnt go to this expecting anything extravagant or mind blowing,0
Its gonna be some cheap laughs (uhh) crummy plot and thats about it,0
"I wouldnt expect much more I mean, its Christmas time",0
They have to come out with these movies it seems like,1
Kind of disappointing that Vince Vaughn is in it cause I thought he was funnier than that,0
"But if you can get over the fact that it is a crappy holiday movie, you might actually enjoy it sort of",0
(uhh) As you may or may not know the plot is of Santa Claus brother (umm) is also privileged to live forever like Santa and thats pretty much all you need to know,1
"Hello, my name is Sarah, and I will be doing the video review for the movie Josie and the Pussycats",1
"(uhh) Basically, I really did not like this movie at all",0
(umm) I felt it was kinda cheesy,0
"(umm) Of course I had low expectations at that, and hose expectations werent even met",0
"So you know, to recommend this movie, you know I really wouldnt",0
"(umm) I, I (stutter) found one thing about this movie that I thought was kind of interesting how (umm) these record companies put (uhh) subliminal messages in music to push products to get people to buy certain things",0
"(umm) That part of the movie was pretty cool, but (umm) for the most part you know, it was, again it was too cheesy for me",0
You know (umm) it was actually expected to be kind of corny,0
"So I really wouldnt recommend this, this (stutter) movie to anybody",0
"(umm) No, I mean, basically the movie was just you know, trying to put you know, just",1
"I just again, really just did not like this movie",0
"I dont recommend it for people and the actors on this movie, they didnt really do a good job either",0
"It was you know, kind of expected as well",0
"These you know, girls that played in this movie just they didnt really do a good job",0
Hi my name is Will and this is my video opinion of the movie Catwoman starring Halle Berry,1
"Its a fullscreen edition (uhh) which means you get some special features including two documentaries, the many faces of Catwoman, profiles the (stutter) evolution of the character",1
(umm) You get an exciting alternative ending in the (stutter) additional scenes as well,0
(umm) I thought that Catwoman was horrible,1
"(uhh) Quite honestly I thought that the big budget you know, film, it should have, the, you know, computer generated images should have worked more seamlessly with the stunts and things like that",0
"I thought that it was (uhh) it relied too, too (stutter) much on the CGI",0
"I didnt (umm) you know, I didnt really like the way that they made her come back to life",0
"I thought you know it, you know while it did stay true to its origin, its just when she did come back I thought her powers were a little unreal for me",0
"(umm) I just you know, just didnt really enjoy it",0
"Her costume of course was great that was one of the highlights having Halle Berry in the movie, you know getting some eye candy",0
But to me that wasnt enough to make a great film,1
"Hey Expo Tv, this is Victor and I have for you a review on this movie entitled Crazy Beautiful",1
Its got (uhh) Kirsten Dunst and Jay Hernandez and its a really good movie,1
"Its (umm) primarily targeted towards like the teenager kind of audience, but the cool thing about this movie is that it has a really cool soundtrack",1
"(umm) And and (stutter) it also features one of my all time favorite bands Oskar, in the movie",1
So I thought that was really cool,1
"(umm) But, its a really cool movie because its very its very (stutter) real, you know",1
"You can tell (umm) I mean, (stutters) you really start to believe in these characters, that theyre going through these (uhh) experiences and stuff and I know that a lot of teenagers in high school can relate to this",1
"Its got you know, a lot of real kind of stuff you know? I I (stutter) definitely relate to it and so (umm) Chicago Tribune gave it three stars, but Im giving it five stars",1
"Its just I, I, I (stutter) enjoyed the movie Im not gonna lie",1
I know its kind of cheesy but,0
My name is Sarah and I will be doing my video opinion of the movie Bring It on Again,1
"(uhh) Its the sequel to the first one, (umm) basically I really did not like this movie at all",0
(umm) I you know it was of course expected being that it was a straight to dvd movie,0
"(umm) I think it was kind of corny, you know I mean some of the the (stutter) jokes in here were just outrageously you know dumb for me",0
"(umm) It, you know I mean I guess basically if you like cheerleading and you know, its something that you do yourself, pick up the movie",0
"But you know, I, it was not my favorite at all",0
"It was basically about (umm) two girls going to college and joining (umm) one of the you know, great qualifying (uhh) cheer teams in the country",0
(umm) And basically they didnt like how things were going so they decided to start their own cheer team,0
"And you know, then there was a competition that they had to compete for that school because that you know, school could only have one cheer team it couldnt have two",1
"So they go through different things of you know, trying to start their own team (umm) you know, doing their own routines, pretty much starting from scratch where the first form routine had already been there",0
"(umm) I mean I, that (stutter), you know again to me it it (stutter) was kind of boring, it just you know, didnt really enthuse me at all",1
(umm) You know I was kind of hoping for a little more excitement like the first one,1
"Hi, my name is Mike and Im here to do a movie review for Thirty Days of Night, which is a moderately new (uhh) film thats still in theaters and it stars Josh Hartnett",1
"(umm) My wife and I saw it (uhh) believe it was two weeks ago, and (uhh) it was pretty terrible",0
"It was not a good film, (uhh) whatsoever",0
"(uhh) The main reason behind it was (uhh) there just really wasnt a lot of action, the colors were pretty drab",0
"(uhh) Even though it was set in Alaska during a period (uhh) in which you get constant night, (umm) everything just seemed to not flow really well, the plot was kind of boring",0
"And they really didnt do a lot with the (uhh) with the new slant on everything that they were going for, which was having the vampires be (uhh) the bad guys in this (uhh) horror movie",0
"(umm) Just overall the flow was awful, (uhh) the audience seemed to not enjoy really anything as well as if (uhh) me or my wife didnt enjoy anything",0
"Halfway through the film, (uhh) (uhh) quite a few people left because they were pretty bored",0
And (uhh) just overall it wasnt really enjoyable,0
The acting was pretty stiff and stilted,0
"(uhh) There was hardly any suspense, and just overall (uhh) not a good film {noise} so",0
Hey Expo,1
"This is Jennifer, and today Im reviewing Gladiator",1
This is an epic movie about a man who was a general in an army,1
And the man is played by Russell Crowe who is just very macho in this movie and does an excellent job playing the role,1
"He is a general in the army and he comes home and he finds that his village has been destroyed, his home has been destroyed, and his wife and chilled, child (stutter) killed",1
So he goes about to exact his revenge and instead is captured and becomes a slave,1
"He is forced to become a gladiator for the empire, and this is a movie about personal triumph and even though your body can be captured by someone, your spirit adheres and that its how, its how (stutter) you choose to live your life no matter what your circumstances are",1
Russell Crowe excels in this role and it just makes you want to stand up and cheer for him when youre watching this and you see what he goes through and what he overcomes,1
"In the back, in the sub ground there are different scenarios that are playing out with the king and his sister and things that are going on there to watch",1
I dont want to give it away in case you havent seen it,1
But this is definitely a movie that you can enjoy,1
Its a little bit long but theres a lot action and it will really just draw you in and the time will go by quickly,1
"The DVD of course has deleted scenes and the directors commentary, always fun to see these things",1
And its overall just a good movie,1
Id give it five stars,1
Definitely fun to watch,1
Enjoyable and a escape from reality,1
"Whats up Expo, this is Adam here again and Im reviewing Underworld",1
"This is the widescreen special edition, I find it to be very entertaining in widescreen, much less than the full screen actually",1
"But a little bit about this movie, it has retaken the idea of vampires and werewolves and they have them pitted against each other in a more, in a (stutter) mortal battle",1
"Theyre fighting each other for wars on end and then this movie, they, the main plot is about a, (uhh) is about a guy who is a descendant of one of these great, great (stutter) ancestors and he hold the key to a more higher power within his blood",1
"So a little bit about that is just the, I mean Im not gonna reveal too much about the movie",1
But Underworld its definitely gonna get five out of five stars,1
"This movie is full of action, intensity, I really like what they do with the vampires and the werewolves",1
Everyones got their own little spinoff,1
"This one, this one (stutter) has a good spinoff of them so youre not gonna be disappointed by that",1
"So Underworld, give it five out of five stars, look for the sequel Underworld Evolution",1
"Its all good, everythings good in this movie",1
Pick it up as soon as you can,1
Alright so next up weve got Chicago,1
Academy Award for best picture winner of two-thousand and two which it definitely should not have won,0
"The Oscar should have gone to Gangs of New York, (uhh) Scorseses masterpiece, or one of his masterpieces I think with (uhh) some other great movies, Taxi Driver and Goodfellas which I think a lot of people love more, but Chicago I thought was a terrible movie",0
"(uhh) I like (uhh) I think the performers are good performers, Richard Gere and (uhh) Catherine Zeta Jones and Rene Zellweger",0
"I find the ladies very attractive (uhh) and very talented actresses, I just didnt like them very much in this",1
"To me this was like a made for TV (stutter) movie, they were trying too hard to try and reinvent the Hollywood musical and it just fell flat",0
"I think the choreography a lot of very hard work went into it, but as a piece of entertainment I personally did not enjoy it",0
"I thought that (uhh), you know, (umm) its just overdone, dumb, silly, ridiculous",0
"I thought the lighting was unbelievable, I thought the style was (uhh) hokey and contrived",0
I thought the story line was a little too (uhh) too (uhh) too much,0
"So I give this a half a star out of five, and again I think the Oscar should have gone to Gangs of New York",0
"Hi, its Jason and Ill be doing a review on the movie Delta Farce coming right up",1
Thank you,1
Hi its Jason and Ill continue my review on Delta Farce,0
"(umm) Basically its a (stutter) comedy that stars three different people, it stars Larry the Cable Guy and Bill Envall and D",0
(stutter) Qualls,1
"(umm) Basically they are (umm) some army, they are mistaken to being army reserve troops",1
And theyre (stutter) hussled away to what they thought was Iraq but what end up happening is they drop them off in Mexico instead and they try to liberate Mexico,0
"(umm) This is by (umm) the blue collar comedy tour director Stevy Harry and (stutter) as some of you may know from the, the (umm) touring for the blue collar comedy tour",0
(umm) If you like these three people you might like this movie,0
I found this movie absolutely dumb,1
"It just, it just (stutter) wasnt good nothing worked",1
(umm) These arent my three favorite comedians,1
(umm) The movies rated PG-thirteen,1
"(umm) Its eighty minutes eighty-nine (stutter) minutes long and it was it was (stutter) (umm) filmed in two thousand seven it was completed and released, so that tells you a lot about how, how (stutter) good this movies I remember when it came out at the movie theaters it wasnt a hit at all",1
"(umm) And also costars Danny Trejo, (umm) but thats about it I mean I dont wanna give away too much but I had a hard time sitting through this",1
"I (stutter) just, I didnt find it funny I actually found it really stupid and as you can see in the background its just a menu with some small clips from the movie",1
(umm) But if youre thinking about buying this movie I probably think twice again,1
Hello I would like to tell you about an excellent new movie from Disney and Pixar and thats Ratatouille,1
(uhh) Its about a little rat named Remy who dreams of becoming a chef,1
"And I mean, but what restaurant will allow a rat to be a chef",1
"So he (umm) you know, really thinks that hes never you know, that hes not gonna go anywhere",1
(umm) But one day he finds himself in Gustos restaurant,1
And Gustos is a (uhh) famous restaurant in Paris,1
And there is a boy that works at (uhh) Gustos named Linguine who cant cook at all,1
"(umm) So they team up together and they (umm) try to become a you know, chef together",1
"(umm) Will it work out though, I mean can a rat actually be a chef",1
"So watch it a find out, theres some good twists and turns in there",1
(umm) Brad Garrett plays the voice of Gusto,0
I love Brad Garret I think hes an excellent actor,1
"(umm) Just, its, its (stutter) a hilarious movie",1
I mean you have to watch this movie it is so good the animation is excellent,1
"(umm) You know, Disney and Pixar although you wouldnt expect anything but excellent and you definitely get that let me show you a quick clip",0
This is the kitchen of (umm) of Gustos,1
{movie} Really good movie you watch it youll have lots of laughs,1
I think youll really enjoy it,1
"Hi, today Im presenting the movie that is in theaters",1
Its called Borat,1
"(uhh), I would give this movie a five out five and two thumbs up",1
It is a hilarious movie,1
"I loved it, and I laughed my butt off while I watched it",1
"(umm), Its mostly about this guy named Borat who is a Kazaky reporter in America, and hes trying to learn about the culture and stuff here, and because hes so different he ends up making a fool out of himself and its hilarious",1
"(umm), Its kind of in a, mock documentary kind of style reality show kind of style where they follow him around with their cameras, and you see the wonderful interactions he has with Americans",1
"Of course its all a big joke, but, its hilarious to see him",1
"And he goes to like different places, and (uhh), and (uhh), country rodeos in the south and things like that",1
"So, I definitely recommend you going and seeing Borat the movie",1
"Its hilarious, and youll laugh your butt off",1
Hi,1
This is a review of Good Luck Chuck,1
I managed to catch this at the dollar theater at my local place,0
(umm) And its a good thing I did because its not a very good movie,1
"(uhh) Basically its about a guy who gets cursed when hes a kid by a goth girl and now every girl he meets and gets with (umm) will marry the next man that, that (stutter) (uhh) that she meets",0
"Or or (stutter) something, its its (stutter) kind of ridiculous",1
"Its got Dane Cook as the main guy, Charlie, its got Dan Fogler as Stu, its got Jessica Alba as (uhh) the love interest Cam",0
"And (umm), you know, shes beautiful and everything but this is, its (stutter) just stupid",0
"Shes just running into stuff the whole time and its just, its ridiculous",0
"(umm) Not really that funny, kind of stupid, (umm) actings not that great",0
"I dont know, I just, I really didnt enjoy this movie, I thought it was dumb",0
"Hey there, ExpoTV there",0
I have the scariest movie in a decade,1
Its called Hostel,0
Its unrated,1
(uhh) But if it was rated it would be rated R because its really bad for you and bad for the kids and theres a lot of killings and a lot of blood and a lot of gore,1
(uhh) Its presented by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Eli Roth,1
So if you know them they have sick minds and they like to make sick movies,0
(uhh) This movie first starts off as like a x rated because you see a lot of girls who has and a lot of guys ding dongs,1
So if you can get past that its not that bad,0
"(uhh) But the movies about how two Americans go backpacking through Europe and theyre just trying to have a good time, but they go to this hostel and eventually they get kidnapped and they get tortured, tortured (stutter)",1
"So you should see if they survive, if they die if they bleed to death, if they get their heads chopped off, limbs chopped off, if youre into that stuff",1
"But check it out, its called Hostel part one, because there is a part two now",1
Hello expotv,1
(umm) Im here right now reviewing the movie currently in theaters called The Heartbreak Kid,1
(umm) This movie stars Ben Stiller,0
"(uhh) Its about this guy that marries this girl and while theyre on his (stutter), while theyre on their honeymoon he finds someone who he loves more, or he begins to fall in love with and so its kind of about that",0
(umm) This movies awful,0
(uhh) {laugh} Its probably the most predictable comedy Ive ever seen,0
(uhh) You dont you dont (stutter) have to be clever to know whats about to happen,1
(umm) Most of the jokes I can put together before they were finished and it was just bad,0
I mean Ben Stiller is usually pretty funny,1
"His movies arent always, dont always have the best plot but at least they make you laugh",0
"And this one, I mean, you can laugh about it being so bad but (uhh) thats about it",0
(umm) Dont see this movie,0
Its not a good movie,0
(umm) Its incredibly predictable and Carlos Mencia is in it who steals jokes,0
So dont see it,0
"Hello Expo TV, Im here to review Beowulf in three D",1
(uhh) This movie was a little bit disappointing to me,0
"(uhh) After reading the book the classic, its obviously an amazing tale",0
(umm) But when you go and its adapted to film I I (stutter) just dont think it was done as well,1
The animation was excellent,1
(umm) It took my eyes a few minutes to adjust to the three D at the theater I was at when (uhh) after I adjusted I thought it looked beautiful,0
"(umm) Especially the last fighting scene, I thought that was the best part of the movie",1
"But on the overall, (uhh) I was kinda disappointed",1
I I (stutter) thought it should have been a little bit deeper,1
"(umm) So if I were to go see this full price, I I (stutter) would not recommend it",0
(umm) I kinda only recommend (uhh) going to see it in matinee,0
"(umm) I know youll miss the 3D, but I would wait for the DVD",0
Hi,1
"Im Liz and Im here to talk to you about The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, based on the beloved series of books by Douglas Adams, may he rest in peace",1
(umm) Im not entirely convinced that the people who made this movie understood the books at all,1
"(umm) Part of, I think, that the remarkable thing about the books is Douglas Adams wrote them sequentially, with no planning ahead of time as to what was gonna to happen",0
"And yet, they all come around into an incredibly tight plot and theme",0
(uhh) Thats part of what makes them so amazing,0
And this movie destroys all of that by sort of creating its own (umm) self-contained plot because I guess they werent planning on making more movies,0
"Theyre certainly not going to now, I dont think",1
(umm) Since no one really liked it that much,0
(umm) They just {sigh} its hard to explain if youre not a Douglas Adams fan,0
"You havent, you know, read all the books and seen the movie",1
"To really feel what it was they got wrong, theres just a feeling missing",0
"Everything that he intended and all these sort of (umm) jokes that he meant to be funny in a particular way just arent the same, and theyve added a lot of their own jokes that are funny in a very different way, not not (stutter) what he would have wanted",0
(umm) Its not a great adaptation,1
"Is it a good movie? I suppose its kind of amusing in its own way, but its not a good adaptation of the story",0
"And I think the greatest example of that is the line at the very end, when Alan Rickman as the robot says, theyre (stutter) heading to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, which is the name of the second, the second (stutter) novel in the series, and is an actual setting in the novel",0
"And he says, not that anyone cares, or asked me, or whatever, but the restaurant is at the other end of the universe",0
"The restaurant was not, even if you casually read Douglas Adams, you know the restaurant is not at the physical end of the universe, its at the temporal end of the universe",1
"Its a place where you can go, utilizing time travel, you can go to this particular point in time, at just the point the universe ends, and watch it end",0
And thats sort of the main attraction of the restaurant,1
Its like their evening show,1
"Thats just a really, really obvious, stupid mistake",0
Why did they have to make that joke? Its not that good,0
"Considering it got something so completely wrong, I think Douglas Adams fans would just grit their teeth",1
(umm) And thats the kind of thing they do in this movie,0
And I think that makes it kind of painful,0
(umm) The only up side is the special effects are fantastic,1
The previous adaptation of Hitchhiker was done by the BBC on a shoestring budget,1
It looks awful,0
"Its great, but it looks terrible",0
"This movie is terrible, and looks great",0
"So, you know, whatever you want to sacrifice, I guess, but, (uhh) no, this movie doesnt capture the spirit of the story at all",0
Hi I will review for you the special collectors edition of Tae Guk Gi,1
"A Korean war film, (umm) the title actually translates to The Brotherhood of War",1
(umm) The movie itself is a lot like Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers,1
"(umm) Its a really stylized film, so you can really get the grittiness of war thats going on all the battles and stuff in this, in the movie",1
"(umm) It is about a the story between of two brothers who are forced to join a war going on in Korea, between the north the north (stutter) and south",1
"(umm) As far as the actual disc, (uhh) DVD collection goes, (uhh) it comes in a two disc set, (uhh) the first disc is the widescreen version of the film and the second disc is a bonus disc that comes with about three hours of footage of behind the scenes, cast documentaries, and outtakes",1
(umm) It is a really well made movie and a really well made (uhh) DVD collectors edition,1
Hi,1
This is my review of Message in a Bottle,1
"(umm) This is a movie starring Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn, and Paul Newman which was based on the best-selling Nicholas Sparks novel (umm) also entitled Message in a Bottle",0
(umm) Im probably in the minority of people,1
"(umm) I know its got a lot of good ratings and stuff when it came out, but, really, not one of my favorite movies",1
And (umm) not surprising,1
"I mean, I did watch",1
This was actually given to me as a gift,1
But (uhh) I dont really care for Nicholas Sparks (umm) writing that much,0
"(uhh) It always seems really cliche to me and (umm) tries to be deep, but its really not",0
"(uhh) So I, you know, wasnt (uhh) crazy about watching this movie in the first place",0
"And it (uhh) I mean, it was okay",1
"I, I (stutter) watched it through",1
Its not like I shut it off in the middle or anything,0
"It was worth (umm) watching on a, you know, boring afternoon",1
"But (umm) (uhh), you know, I would recommend it if you like the Nicholas Sparks books",0
"And (uhh) also, not a huge Kevin Costner fan, so (umm) not really up for that",0
"I didnt find him, I did read the book before I saw the movie, and (uhh) he didnt really fit",0
"I dont know how I saw the character exactly, but (uhh) (umm) thats just my personal opinion",0
(umm) But the movie itself is one-hundred-and-thirty-one minutes long,0
Its a pretty long movie,0
"And (umm) the DVD is available on Amazon dot com, along with pretty much any DVD retail",0
Hi,1
Today on ExpoTV Im going to be reviewing the movie Mr,1
Magoriums Wonder Emporium,1
And Mr,1
Magoriums Wonder Emporium is (umm) a movie thats in theaters now and it stars (umm) Jason Bateman and (uhh) Natalie Portman and Dustin Hoffman,0
"And (umm) basically its about (umm) this guy, Dustin Hoffman, named Mr",0
And he has this huge magic shop,0
"And theres, like, tons of stuff going on",0
"And (umm) he, he (stutter) says (umm) its time for him to leave, which kind of implies, like, hes going to die",0
"And (umm) so he leaves, hes going to leave the store to (umm) Natalie Portmans character to, you know, run and keep it going",0
"And (umm) also, this other guy is going to help (umm) do the bills, the character who is (umm) played by (uhh) Jason Bateman",0
"And (umm) this guy is really, like, drab and doesnt believe in the magic of the store and (umm) is just generally a jerk",1
"And (umm) the movie kind of goes, follows (umm) the decisions and how they affect (umm) those two characters in relation to, like, who owns the store and (umm) how the store handles (umm) each one of those characters",0
"So its really a fantastical, fantasy-like movie and (umm) its not really that good",1
(umm) The story is kind of blur and drab and its just so so,1
So I dont really recommend it,1
"I give it, like, two stars",1
Its not very good,1
"(umm) Even though theres a lot of, like, famous good actors and actresses (umm) it still doesnt make up for just the bad story",1
"Corbitt here, reviewing the movie Reign of Fire",1
"Reign of Fire is a movie starring Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale and its about this dragon thats found in the earth and (uhh) basically all hell rains loose when it gets freed, the world is pretty much being destroyed and (umm) {sigh} theres not much to say about this movie",0
"You know, Im a huge fan of both the stars, Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale",0
Christian Bale has done a lot of good movies and {sigh} I dont know what happened but (umm) this isnt that good of a movie,1
"(umm) Youd think even these two great actors could save it, but thats not the case",0
(umm) Its just not that good of an action movie,0
"The conversations with the people are just, like, they dont sound right, they dont sound real",0
(umm) It seems a little over the top even for having a dragon in it and (umm) its just not that good,0
"(umm) Surprisingly with this movie they added a lot of extra features including a making of dragons, a pyrotechnics featurette, (uhh) conversations with the director, a trailer, and surround sound",0
But (umm) I really wouldnt recommend this,1
"I guess if youre a huge dragon fan you might wanna check it out, but (umm) this definitely a pass for me",0
Hi today Im reviewing the DVD movie All Dogs Go to Heaven Two,1
"I did not particularly enjoy the first All Dogs Go to Heaven movie, so needless to say I was less than thrilled when my mother in law got my kids this next All Dogs Go to Heaven movie",0
"(umm) My kids really didnt enjoy this one, either, and I didnt",0
Definitely,1
"It includes the dogs from the first movie, Charlie and Barkin",1
It does not include the little orphan girl from the first movie Anne Marie,0
"And this movie has a little boy in it, so I guess it would be good (umm) for (umm) little boys to relate to this guy more than the girl in the first one",1
(umm) (uhh) Theres supposed to be a lot of thrills in this movie I didnt find it that thrilling and theres some villains in the movie that kind of make it a little bit dark so I dont really think its that great for children,0
"(umm) So I definitely would not recommend purchasing this movie, if you have to see it then I would definitely recommend renting it before {laughter} you (umm) spend the money to buy it",0
"Jo Jon: Okay Im John Brodd, CEO of Cima NanoTech.",1
I think the geo-political issues certainly have the defining factor certainly in the regional area and it does have a layer of complexity to the financial situation.,1
Hi,1
"Im Liz, and Im here to talk to you about Moonraker",1
This is a ridiculous movie,0
"(umm) It is the eleventh James Bond film, fourth to star Roger Moore as James Bond",0
"It is available by itself, or as part of the Ultimate Edition Volume Four in the James Bond Collections, this nice silver one",0
"It also contains Octopussy, Tomorrow Never Dies, You Only Live Twice, and Doctor No",0
"This movie, as I say, is completely ridiculous",0
Its very loosely based on the novel Moonraker by Ian Fleming,0
"(umm) It was actually chosen (uhh) for release at this moment (uhh) in time because of the popularity of Star Wars (stutter) at the time, had been very recent",0
"They originally were going to do For Your Eyes Only as the next film, and they put that off until after, because they wanted to get this out there",0
That was a really bad idea,0
"(umm) The character of Holly Goodhead yes, thats an actual Bondgirl name, a lot of people think thats a parody or something from Austin Powers no Holly Goodhead, that was her name, is a complete",1
"(umm) Shes of course a NASA scientist, because what bond girl wouldnt be? (uhh) She is a total invention of the film",0
"Theres no such character in the novel, shes completely ridiculous",0
"Who, who (stutter) on Earth would have, have (stutter) that name and act like that, I dont know",0
"(umm) Apparently, (uhh) shes shes (stutter) quite dull, (uhh) the actress who, who (stutter) played the part",1
"Well, the characters dull",0
"Presumably, the actress, and the entire rest of her family are just as dull, because she claims shes able to convince her grandmother that the name of Goodhead referred to her having a good head on her shoulders, I dont know",1
(umm) James Bond in Space,1
"How much more ridiculous can you get? I saw this movie on TV when I was about ten, but this is the most ridiculous thing Ive ever seen",1
"Jaws, from the Spy Who Loved Me, (uhh) played by Richard Kiel, is brought back as like a good guy in this for some reason",1
"I guess he was a popular character and they wanted to reuse him, and he has like a love interest with Pigtails, and its so so very, oh oh its just upsetting",0
(umm) Its bad,0
"(stutter) I think there are people who get some sort of sick enjoyment out of this movie, but its not quite in the so-bad-its-good category, especially if you are a James Bond fan, its very painful to watch this at times",1
"On the other hand, if youre a really devoted fan, you need to own this anyway",1
"Hi, my name is Anaj, and today Im reviewing the DVD of the movie Screwed",1
"Screwed stars (uhh) Norm MacDonald, Dave Chappelle, and Danny DeVito",1
"(uhh) Well nothing much to tell about this movie that, you know, but its its (stutter) bad",1
"Its its (stutter) not good, I mean",1
"So they have tried to make this as a kind of cheesy comedy movie and, you know, something from the team of Saturday Night Live or something like that",0
(uhh) Got this DVD from a friend and (uhh) watched it,0
I didnt like it at all,0
"I mean, (uhh) the jokes are kind of old",0
"(uhh) You know, theres not much laughter",0
"I mean you have to kind of make yourself laugh if you have to but theres they have build up a story, its a little dramatic but (uhh) most of it is old and theres nothing not a new idea in there",1
(umm) But this DVD has some special features that come along with this movie,0
"Theres (uhh) like the production notes, the cast and the filmmakers, and the theatrical trailers",0
"So in fact believe me I preferred the trailers over the movie, thats how bad I (uhh) you know I thought this movie was",0
Didnt like it at all,0
Hi,0
Im Liz and Im here to talk to you about Kingpin which is from the guys who brought Theres Something About Mary and Dumb and Dumber according to the back of the DVD case which should give you some indication about (uhh) what kind of movie this is,1
"(umm) It stars Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid, and Vanessa Angel, whoever she is",0
"(umm) I saw the trailer for Kingpin many years ago, it was attached to some (uhh) DVD that I watched pretty often and every time I saw it I thought man that movie looks so stupid",0
"And then (uhh) I saw that (uhh) my boyfriend owned it and he said oh you should give it, you should give it a shot",1
"Its (umm) its a lot funnier than the trailer cause in the trailer they couldnt use a lot of the, you know, more raunchy humor and its like okay, fine, you know",1
Ill give it a chance,0
When will I learn to trust my instincts? I dont know,0
Anyway (umm) Kingpin I I (stutter) didnt think was particularly funny,0
"It has a few sort of chuckle moments with kind an aww ending, but other than that no way",0
Kingpins not funny to me at all,0
"And (stutter) granted it is a kind of Theres Something About Mary, American Pie style of humor that has never appealed to me really (umm) and its not that its vulgar because I dont mind that at all, its that that is what is supposed to be funny about it",1
"If it was a movie like Superbad (umm) which came out recently, very, very funny and its incredibly vulgar but thats not the basis of the humor",1
The basis of the humor is the delivery of the line and how people sort of interact with each other,0
And theres just so much more realism to it and more heart to it and this is just bleh,0
I dont know,0
"(umm) Bill Murray is in it, (stutter) that might be why",0
"Ive never really liked a movie with Bill Murray in it (umm) that I can recall and (uhh) its not that I have anything against him, I just have never liked him",0
And maybe he ruined it for me,1
"(umm) Anyway (uhh) to talk really more in detail about this movie Woody Harrelson is a pro bowler who loses his hand, cant bowl anymore, finds a (uhh) naive Amish guy who can bowl really well and his plan is to win some prize money for a bowling tournament using this (umm) this Amish fellow",1
"And of course everyone learns a valuable lesson about not using people or whatever, I dont know",1
"I just dont like this movie and (uhh) Im sick of talking about it so quite frankly if this kind of movie is your style, (umm) if this is the kind of movie you like and you know if it is then Im sure youll love this movie",0
If youre not a big fan of this type of movie dont even bother,0
Its not any better than any of the others and (uhh) youll find it quite dull and unfunny,0
Hi expotv,1
My names Lindsay and Im here today to talk to you about the DVD movie Stuck on You,1
"This stars Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear as (stutter) conjoined twins (uhh) who are combined, who are adjoined I guess at the liver",1
Therefore they cannot be separate because they need their liver to survive,1
"(umm) This movie is made by the Farrelly brothers, who also made Theres Something About Mary and all I have to say if you like Theres Something About Mary you will hate this movie",0
"It is stupid, ridiculous, slapstick, like really cheesy, cheesy lines that they think theyre funny and I dont think theyre funny",0
"So I really cant recommend this movie {laugh} (umm) but on the DVD it has (umm) a audio comedy by the Farrelly brothers, (uhh) has deleted scenes, a bloopers reel, (uhh) a theatrical teaser and trailer, things like that",0
(umm) But I dont like this movie (uhh) but you can check it out (uhh) anywhere you buy DVDs,0
"Again its Stuck on You, the DVD movie starring Greg Kinnear and Matt Damon",1
"Hi ExpoTV, Im here today to talk to you about the DVD movie Jackass The Movie",1
(umm) The only part that I could find to play for you was the opening credits because everything else is insanely crude and terrible,0
And this is the least offensive part that I could find to play,0
(uhh) So that should tell you something about the movie,1
"This movie is not for children, it is rated R, R, R",0
Should be rated more if theres rating more than that,1
"(umm) It has a (uhh) restriction on it, it says (uhh) that it is rated R for dangerous sometimes extremely crude stunts, language and nudity, and that is an understatement",1
"(umm) It is raunchy at its best and lots of people getting hurt and doing insane things that you and I would probably never imagine to do, but these guys did",0
"(umm) So if you like that kind of stuff, (uhh) go out and get this movie, (uhh) it is again Jackass The Movie on DVD, and its rated R for your entertainment",1
"Fred Claus, a current movie in theaters, is about Santa Clauss older brother, Fred Claus, who is forced to move to the north pole",1
"A movie kind of suitable for Christmas and families, but (stutter) ultimately falls flat because Fred Claus just isnt a really good movie",0
(umm) The actors many of you may know,1
"Its kind of like, a good set of actors but an awful script, bad directing, and the, the story is nothing to really talk about",0
"(umm) The, its basically a comedy, right? And when you go to see a comedy you expect to laugh, you expect to have a good time, and although Fred Claus is very silly and you shouldnt go in expecting much, its really not funny",0
"(umm) So I guess I would recommend this only to people who have families that they like to go see it with, and have a decent time",1
"But theres a lot of other comedies out there, even if theyre not suited for teenagers and people in their twenties and thirties",1
"(umm) Fred Claus is a movie I definitely do not recommend, unless youre taking children to see it, and with such actors you wouldnt imagine having such a bad script and directing and everything like that",0
Fred Claus,1
"Hi Expo TV, this is Melissa",1
You can (umm) check out my profile at PM three two one,1
"Im here today to review for you the movie Mallrats, directed by Kevin Smith",1
"(umm) {clears throat} This is, you know, got the classic Jay and Silent Bob duo in here, Jason Lee",0
"(umm) Shannen Doherty, Basically theres just a bunch of guys, they just hang out at the mall of the time",0
"(umm) as it says on the front of the (uhh) DVD, theyre not there to shop, theyre not there to work, theyre just there",1
"And thats basically what they do, they just hang out at the mall all the time",1
Theyre mallrats,1
(umm) We do have some good special features,1
"We have feature commentary with the director Kevin Smith, cast members Ben Affleck, Jason Lee, Jason Muse, producer Scott Mosier, and Vincent (uhh) and I cant pronounce his last name, Im sorry",1
"(umm) over an hour of deleted scenes, live footage from the feature commentary (stutter) session, featurettes, theatrical trailers, (umm) soundtrack presentation, (uhh) by the Goofs Build Me Up Buttercup and production photographs",1
"(umm) once again {clears throat} Im not really into this (uhh) type of (uhh) genre, I guess (umm) my husband was helping me out and he said, if you give this one a bad review I dont know what to say and I was like well, I didnt say anything, but Im definitely giving it like a two out of five",1
"Definitely not my cup of tea, but if you like that (uhh) genre then youre gonna like it",1
"Hi, this is Dan with a review of The Golden Compass, available in theaters nationwide",1
The Golden Compass in my opinion was a turkey,0
Absolutely thought it was terrible,0
(umm) Partially probably because I never read the book,0
(umm) But even so (uhh) if youve seen The Chronicles of Narnia think of The Golden (uhh) Compass providing the action that Chronicles of Narnia missed but none of the story line,0
"(uhh) The Golden Compass spent so much time trying to (uhh) lucidly (uhh) portray and introduce new characters that there was really never any character development, nor do you really get a sense of what was going on",0
"(umm) Basically you have a little girl who ends up going to the north in this fantasy world with friends Iorek, (uhh) which is a ice bear, (umm) played by a (uhh) Ian McKellens voice and (umm) runs into (uhh) unraveling (uhh) secrets of her past and of her future as she meets a variety of different people",0
(umm) Unfortunately after she meets all this a brief scuffle occurs and the movie ends all too quickly,0
"(uhh) For example one of the star features in there, who you know, I thought was (uhh) one of the main leads in the movie doesnt even show up for most of the movie, and that would be our friend (uhh) (stutter) Daniel Craig, better known as the new James Bond (umm) who plays a (stutter) major character in this movie",1
"Oh wait, in the next movie in this installment",0
"So it was a big downer, especially since I did not realize, you know, this was the beginning of (uhh) a blockbuster (umm) hit that was supposed to (uhh) go into effect",0
Well blockbuster it was not,1
(uhh) Not recommended,0
Well see if they continue this terrible series,0
Would not recommend seeing The Golden Compass in theaters this season,1
{noise} Hi ExpoTV my name is Lindsey and I am here today to talk to you about the DVD movie A Clockwork Orange,1
Hello,1
"Today Im reviewing Munich directed by Steven Spielberg, starring Eric Bana and Daniel Craig (uhh) from the most recent double-oh-seven movie",1
(uhh) This movie basically is about (uhh) the nineteen-seventy-two (uhh) Olympic massacre of the Israeli (umm) Olympians,0
(uhh) There were eleven of them that were assassinated and Eric Banas character (stutter) and a group of (umm) other Israeli soldiers are hired to go and track down the Palestinians (uhh) that are believed to have killed (uhh) these eleven athletes,0
(umm) And its really that story (umm) from cradle to grave,0
It works it from the very beginning all the way through,0
(umm) I got to say for this to be a Steven Spielberg movie I wasnt really thrilled with it,0
(umm) Again (stutter) maybe its just I didnt get it,0
"(uhh) But it was definitely praised by the critics, it actually got (uhh) five Academy Award nominations (umm) when it came out",0
I didnt like it,1
"(uhh) That doesnt mean that you wont like it, it just means that I didnt like it",1
I would not recommend this one though,1
"(umm) Its long, its drawn out, it takes a long time to even get started",0
"(umm) If you like to see random things blow up, well this one might be for you but I I (stutter) really didnt see much plot in it",0
Very slow,1
(umm) So I would not recommend this one,0
"Hi, tonight Im reviewing The Ice Harvest starring Billy Bob Thornton and John Cusack",1
"(uhh) This movie is kind of a crime spoof, (uhh) for lack of a better word",0
I (uhh) guess you could say a comedic gangster movie,1
"(uhh) Essentially you have John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton who pair up to actually steal money (umm) from a crime boss played by Randy Randy (stutter) Quaid, who actually does a really good job providing some comedic relief (umm) to this one",0
"(uhh) When they steal the money {clears throat} excuse me, they have to go through and do (uhh) go through the night and cross all kinds of stuff",1
(uhh) Parts of it are really really farfetched,1
Parts of it are bust your gut funny though,0
(umm) But its only small parts,0
"Pretty much what they showed in the previews that looked funny, thats whats gonna be funny in this video",0
(umm) So not a lot above that,1
(umm) It does have an alternate ending in the bonus features,1
(umm) I dont know that it makes it any better though,0
(uhh) But take a look at that (stutter) alternate ending,0
"Also some outtakes from Billy Bob Thornton, some directors commentary, bloopers, (uhh) things like that",1
(umm) So if I had to recommend this one I would probably stay away from it just because its blah,1
Theres nothing to it,1
(umm) So I would probably not recommend this one,0
Hello everyone,0
"Playing over my shoulder here is Alien Resurrection, (uhh) and its a pretty stupid movie",0
(uhh) The first Alien is a good movie,0
(uhh) Aliens is a very good movie,0
"Alien three is not so good of a movie, and this is the worst of the four (uhh) in my opinion",0
"(uhh) Sigourney Weaver, who died at the end of Alien three, is (uhh) genetically (uhh) brought back to life so she can star in another sequel that (uhh) tries very, very hard to be funny and just ends up being not funny at all",1
"(umm) It has really good cinematography and a really good visual style the guy who directed it (umm), Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Im not sure if I pronounced his name properly, I dont speak French, so pardon me, (umm) he also directed (umm) City of Lost Children and Delicatessen and (uhh) Amelie, (uhh) which is a pretty good movie",0
"He directed this and I dont think he spoke English when he directed this, otherwise he may, might might (stutter) have have noticed how terrible a lot of the dialogue in this movie is",0
"(umm) It was written by (umm) Joss Whedon, thats right",0
"He (uhh) wrote, I think, some episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer",1
I dont know,1
I really didnt care for this movie,0
(uhh) It doesnt add anything new to the franchise,0
(umm) Some of the actors are okay,1
"(umm) Weaver does her best with what shes given, and (uhh) but it really doesnt amount to much in my opinion",0
"(umm) As far as (umm) special features go on this disc, (uhh) the only thing thats on here is (umm) some interviews with the cast and crew, so if you, you know, are looking for some special features, this is not the edition to go for",1
(umm) I really dont like this movie,1
Hello,1
"Today Im reviewing Flight of the Phoenix, starring Dennis Quaid, (uhh) Tyrese Gibson, and (umm) Giovanni Ribisi",1
(uhh) This movie also has Hugh Laurie in it (uhh) before he became House and really became famous,0
(uhh) So its interesting to see him in some of these old roles,0
(umm) This movie at at (stutter) its core is about (umm) a cargo plane with some mismatched passengers on it,1
"Its flying over a desert, (uhh) runs into a storm and crashes",1
(uhh) So the survivors that are left are all stranded in this desert and theyre trying to find (umm) a way to get out,0
"(umm) The way it ends and the story line of it altogether is really, really, really farfetched",0
You really have to buy into (uhh) movie magic to go along with this one,0
"(umm) Dennis Quaid (uhh) he used to be a really good actor, all of a sudden it seems like every single movie hes in he has the same exact expressions on his face (umm) so Im not sure whats going on there but Im definitely getting tired of seeing his scowl",1
"(umm) Movie not all that great, like I said really, really farfetched",1
"(uhh) When you see the ending, if you ever see the ending, you will probably think its the stupidest thing youve ever seen before because (uhh) its its (stutter) really over the top the way they ended this one",1
A few (umm) bonus features on this one,1
"(uhh) Some directors commentary, some (stutter) deleted and/or extended scenes, (umm) and some making of the movie documentary diary type (umm) entries",1
So as far as this one goes I would say definitely (uhh) leave it on the shelf,0
I probably wouldnt even waste my time to (uhh) to watch it,0
This one was definitely a disappointment for me,0
"Hello, today Im reviewing the movie Showtime, starring Robert Deniro and Eddie Murphy",1
"(umm), I gotta say that when I heard Robert Deniro and Eddie Murphy I actually thought it was going to be the funny, one of the funniest things Ive ever seen before and it just didnt work",0
"(umm), I dont like this movie",1
"(uhh) Essentially the premise of it is, (umm), Robert Deniro is a, you know, a cop, defined by what you see on television, I mean, just a mans man",0
"He goes out and he, you know, he does what hes supposed to do by the rules",0
"I, hes kind of bully, bullied (stutter) into (umm), participating in a (stutter) reality show",1
"And hes not happy about that, so cameras are following him around night and day, (umm)",0
"On the opposite end of the spectrum you have (stutter) Eddie Murphys character whos kind of, arrogant, and all about being on TV, (uhh) ready for his time in the spotlight",0
"And (umm), the chemistry between the two as friends just didnt come off",0
"(uhh), Not very funny at all",0
A couple of one liners here and there,1
(uhh) But I definitely didnt think it was one of the funniest things Ive ever seen,1
"I thought, you know, worth watching, maybe once, and then that was it",0
"(umm) As far as bonus foot, footage (stutter), there is actually some behind-the-scenes footage on here",0
"(umm) The HBO first-look at this movie, (umm) some deleted scenes, some extended scenes, and even a blooper real, but even those things really dont help this movie out",0
"So, for me, this ones only gonna pull a one out of five stars",0
"If you can see it for free, Id see it for free",0
"Hello, today Im reviewing the movie A Bronx Tale, starring Robert De Niro and (stutter) Chazz Palmintiri",1
(uhh) This movie is actually the directorial debut (uhh) by Robert De Niro,1
(umm) Its classic De Niro in the fact that its kind of got a mafia overlay in everything thats going on,1
"(uhh) Essentially Chazz Palmintiri is a crime boss and Robert De Niro is a bus driver, so you have two opposite sides of the tracks and in between these two gentlemen is Robert De Niros son who is seeing the best of both worlds",1
"(umm) He has his father that has everyones respect because he earned it, but he has to work hard for it and he sees the crime boss who has everybodys respect because theyre all scared to death of him",1
(umm) So he gets to see both sides of the story and has to make a decision on which way hes gonna go with it,1
(umm) Its a very very good movie,1
(umm) One that kind of makes you think,1
"(uhh) you can sit back, you can enjoy it and for a directorial debut its definitely impressive on the side of Robert De Niro",1
"(umm) A couple of bonus features, not a whole lot",1
"(uhh) Just some cast bios, (uhh) its dubbed in multiple language and (uhh) multiple languages and (uhh) it has the original theater trailer",1
"(uhh) So nothing big there, just a couple of things",1
"But definitely one that you want to add to your collection, especially if you are a gangster (uhh) movie fan",1
"Hello, today Im reviewing the movie Vanity Fair starring Reese Witherspoon",1
(uhh) This movie is a Focus Features release which means its an independent film (umm) and you can really tell this is an indie film,0
(umm) It may just be me but I didnt get this one,0
(umm) I love Reese Witherspoon,0
"I think, you know, she does a great job in acting",0
"Love Sweet Home Alabama, (umm) all those movies",0
This one was kind of horrible for me,0
Essentially she plays a girl who is poor,1
Shes down and out on her luck and decides to lie and cheat her way into another English class during the eighteen-hundreds,1
"(umm) Of course, you know, along the way she ends up meeting a guy and things, you know, one thing leads to another and (umm) that gets in the way of what shes trying to do",1
(umm) so really the basic story thats already been told,0
Weve seen it before,0
Its just she did not pull this role off,0
"(umm) The movie, I didnt like the writing, I didnt like the premise behind it",1
(uhh) Definite only a one out of five stars for me,1
(umm) (stutter) Few special features on this one,1
A look at the women behind Vanity Fair,0
"(umm) Some directors commentary, some deleted scenes and even a behind the scenes look at the movie",1
(uhh) But even those bonus features arent going to make it any better,1
Were looking at one out of five stars on this one,1
If I were a rich man,1
"{singing} You ever wonder where that came from? Its not Gwen Stefani, If I Were a Rich Girl",1
{singing} This is the original,1
Its the film of course,1
"(umm) My parents have both seen this (uhh) multiple, multitudes of times in actual, like, play form",1
"So, my dad bought this for my mom",1
"I had never seen it before until this film, so, I was not let down",1
It is very well done,1
(umm) It has a lot to do with Jewish culture and things like that,1
"(umm) Some other great songs besides the (uhh) If I were a rich man song is (uhh) matchmaker, matchmaker make me a match",1
(umm) Yeah,1
Its its (stutter) a great story,1
Its its (stutter) one of those movies that until you see it you really cant describe it,1
(umm) Its described as the most powerful movie ever made,1
"I wouldnt, (umm) (stutter) movie musical ever made",1
"I wouldnt say that, because I really like Phantom",1
"However, it was really good",1
Its one of those must-sees,1
"(umm) I really liked this movie and I would recommend it to everyone as, (uhh) like, whos a fan of musicals or is a fan of just Jewish culture or who just wants to see a really good movie",1
This is the widescreen special edition version of Underworld: Evolution,1
"Starring Kate Beckinsale, its the sequel to the hit movie Underworld",1
In which she plays a vampire,1
(uhh) And in this (stutter) movie she has to fight a new group of (uhh) vampire werewolf hybrids which are trying to take over the world,1
(umm) Movie wasnt that great,1
"(uhh) on the DVD the best (uhh) comment they can get is explosive entertainment from someone at FoxTV so they know, (uhh) wasnt that well received",0
But Kate Beckinsale looks fantastic in this movie,0
Shes super hot and youll enjoy the movie for that aspect,1
(uhh) In terms of the DVD features it does have (stutter) a few special features (uhh) directors and filmmakers commentary,1
"A few documentaries about (stutter) how the visual effects were made, how the stunts were made",1
(uhh) How the creatures were thought up,1
"Hi, Im Liz and Im here to talk about Manos: The Hands of Fate",1
Quite possibly the worst movie ever made,0
I think its a great candidate for it (umm) because it is generally so bad that it cannot be enjoyed,0
"It is, it is (stutter) like sour milk",0
"No matter which way you swirl it in your mouth its just, its just (stutter) awful",1
"(umm) Manos I think is a better candidate for the title than, say, Plan Nine From Outer Space which you can actually watch and enjoy",0
"Manos is nearly unwatchable and I think the only, the only decent excuse for watching it is either watching the episode of Mystery Science Theater or being Quentin Tarantino (stutter) and enjoying it for some reason",0
(umm) Hes clearly demented,0
(umm) Manos is (umm) The story about some (uhh) it doesnt make any sense,1
"(uhh) There theres (stutter) a guy called the master whos played by this (uhh) menacing fellow here, who played a trucker kind of (umm) who (uhh) owns a house and (umm) a very strange satyr named (uhh) named (uhh) Torgo takes care of it for him",1
You cant really tell that Torgos a satyr because you dont see his hooves so he just looks like a guy with very large knees and walks funny,0
(umm) Incidentally the guy who played Torgo killed himself a few months after the film was released,0
(uhh) Family members and friends believe it was unrelated but Im not so sure,0
"(umm) A a (stutter) vacationing family runs across this house, basically (umm) fall under this spell, this strange cult that owns the, I dont know",0
"It doesnt make any sense, its ridiculous, its hilarious and yet a little creepy at the same time",0
"(umm) Which of course is the intent seeing as it is a horror movie, yet (uhh) the creepiness just kind of adds to the badness of it somehow and (uhh) it it (stutter) overall its a very unlikable {sigh} movie",0
Although the lore about it is (umm) is fantastic,0
(umm) If you just go online and read about this movie its its (stutter) quite interesting and hilarious how it came to be,0
"(umm) And (uhh) thats really the only good thing about it is the sort of cult following that is has, the movie itself is just awful",0
And its even more unbearable to watch this uncut version,0
"You know, watching Mystery Science Theater is bad enough",0
"(uhh) This versions even worse, its just this long sequences of nothing and (umm) I dont know what they were thinking when they made this",0
(uhh) It was made by a fertilizer salesman so take that for what its worth,1
Hi today Im reviewing the DVD movie Rush Hour Three,1
This movie like the previous two Rush Hour movies stars Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker,1
This one actually takes place in Paris,1
"(umm) Theyre after a Chinese mastermind, theres (uhh) lots of action in this movie (umm) I did not find this Rush Hour Three to be as funny as the other two Rush Hour movies",1
I really think they shouldve stopped at the first one because in my opinion they kind of got progressively worse after the first one,0
(umm) If you are just (umm) (uhh) diehard fan of the Rush Hour series and just wanna see what happens next then thats probably the only person that I would recommend this DVD to,0
"(uhh) (umm) Otherwise I just really wouldnt waste your time, it just did not measure up to the first two movies at all (umm) (uhh) especially the first one",0
Hi,1
Today Im reviewing the DVD movie Sweet November,1
This movie is a romantic movie,0
"It stars Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron, and Charlize Theron plays a woman who just kind of wants to escape through life, escape to relationships, not having any strings attached",1
(umm) So she invites men into her life for one month only and Keanu Reeves just happens to be her November man and (umm) well its kind a cheesy romantic movie,1
I really didnt enjoy it that much,0
"(umm) A lot of parts of it were very predictable and (umm) I for the most part like romantic movies, but this one I just thought it was really a little bit too cheesy",0
"(umm) It its (stutter) just really, really predictable",0
"You cant, I mean, like most romantic movies (umm) not really a lot to (umm) the plot and I just really didnt enjoy it that much",0
"So (umm) if youre a real sap and really like romantic movies, any kind, then check it out",0
But if not then dont waste your time,0
Hi Im here reviewing Aliens versus Predator: Requiem,1
This is the sequel to Alien Versus Predator which came out two years ago,1
"(umm) This movie, it was, I, it was a pretty good horror movie",1
(uhh) There were a lot of frightening parts,0
I know but this whole alien versus predator thing is just way too commercialized,1
"(uhh) I felt like its not doing justice to the original Alien, the original Predator movies",0
"(uhh) In this movie, a predator lands on earth to kill the aliens that escape from the ship at the end of the last movie",0
"And (uhh) couple of new things in this movie, theres a pred-alien combination predator alien thats kind of a, cheesy and expected (uhh) you know, next step for this franchise",1
And some of you were just kind of cheesy,1
I dont like the whole Alien versus Predator franchise,0
"But it was you know, an entertaining horror movie if youre just looking to have a good time",0
"Not really looking for you know, very well done movie",0
I guess this movie will do,0
Im personally gonna give it a two out of five,0
I dont think it ever deserves more than that,0
"Hi, (umm) so Expo",1
Time to review a movie,1
"(umm) I really like Hilary Swank, I think shes a great actress and I think she was fantastic in Boys Dont Cry",0
I didnt see the boxing movie cuz (uhh) I just heard that it was too grim,0
"But (umm) I thought she was tremendous in Boys Dont Cry, so I really wanted to see what she was up to",1
So I went to see P,1
I Love You,0
Heres my little thingy,0
Alright,0
Let me be frank,0
Shes just not sort of a romantic heroine in my mind,1
(umm) Its a sort of sickly sweet love story about a a (stutter) woman whose (umm) husband dies and leaves her letters that (umm) try to help her get back into life,0
"And you know, its a sweet idea and it was definitely worth seeing if youre looking for something (umm) kind of schmaltzy {laughter} but (umm) Id recommend waiting for the DVD or (umm) yeah",1
Definitely its more of a renter,1
"And she just doesnt have the (uhh) sort of, romantic heroine look",1
I found her kind of (uhh) harsh and (umm) it just didnt capitalize on her strengths,1
"So not a highly recommended movie, probably like a two star movie",0
Hi my name is Anesh and today Im reviewing the movie Aliens versus Predators requiem which is currently running in theaters nationwide,1
(uhh) Now this movie is a sequel of the earlier movie and (uhh) sorry to say but its not as good in fact its terrible and I rate this movie two on five to start with,0
"(uhh) The movie is the same you know theres this war between the predators and aliens theres only one predator (uhh) left on earth and you know he contacts the base station and then ask for backup (uhh) there lots of (uhh) you know, action sequences",1
"(uhh) But none as good as the one that would and you know, in the earlier movie",0
This one is you know disappointing the scenes repeat again and again,0
(uhh) The same kind of action and you you (stutter) would not expect them to come up with something new something different that would actually gather the attention of the audience make it more interesting but (uhh) nothing that you can see in this movie,0
"(umm) Really disappointing, (uhh) two on five again and (uhh) you know if youre really big (stutter) fan of sci-fi these kind of movies go to theaters otherwise you know just wait and maybe watch it on DVD later on",0
(umm) Totally not recommended at all,0
Hi expo,1
"So I think I finally hit the wall, movie wise",1
"(umm) I (stutter) you know, I was thinking okay, Diane Keaton, (uhh) (uhh) Queen Latifah, Katie Holmes, how bad can it be? You know? Diane Keatons awesome, and Queen Latifah is totally cool, and Katie Holmes shes cute",0
"Okay, here are the good things I can say about this movie",1
(uhh) They all had really good hair and (uhh) it was nice to see Katie Holmes with a man her own age {laugh},1
I wish I could take credit for that comment but (uhh) somebody else said it,1
(uhh) So anyway (umm) Im talking about Mad Money,1
Really not a great movie,1
In fact I think it speaks to the moral bankruptcy of our culture {laugh} and my own bad taste that I would go to this movie,1
"So (uhh) I cant begin to tell you how bad I think this movie is, and Im really sorry because it actually could have been kind of good",0
"So (uhh) Ill give it one star for (uhh), actually half a star for their hair, (uhh) everybody had good hair, and (uhh) half a star for (uhh) Katie Holmes dancing",0
But thats about it,0
Hi,1
"Today Id like review Bee Movie, which is an animated movie currently in theaters",0
"This is (uhh) written by Jerry Seinfeld and it stars Jerry Seinfeld and Rene Zellweger, or the voices of them cause its computer animated",1
"(umm) But this is an okay movie but overall I just found it to be not very interesting, like I didnt see the point",0
It wasnt any different than all those other animated movies about bugs or toys or stuff like that,0
"(umm) I love, you know, Toy Story and Ratatouille and most of the Pixar movies (umm) but this was just really generic and maybe it had a few funny one liners and Seinfeld was his normal self, but (uhh) overall I just didnt see the point",0
"I mean besides the good animation (umm) I really cant recommend it unless you have little kids cause theyd probably enjoy it, but other than that not a great movie",0
So I give Bee Movie a four out of ten,0
Hi,1
I am here to review the movie Platinum Blonde,1
(umm) This is a movie directed by Frank Capra (uhh) starring Jean Harlow,1
"(uhh) This is a movie about a (uhh) newspaper reporter, hard working, lower class, honest to the fault, newspaper reporter investigating (umm) something that happen in a rich family (uhh) who with their (stutter) daughter Jean Harlow",1
(uhh) The Jean Harlow character (uhh) (stutter) seduces (uhh) the young innocent (uhh) crusading (uhh) newspaper reporter and (uhh) also in this movie we have the young Loretta Young who is incredibly beautiful and our intrepid reporter for whatever reason ignores her,1
"(uhh) The problem I have with this movie is, despite how old I look, Jean Harlow is before my time and I dont sense the appeal of the Jean Harlow",0
"(umm) big west was before my time and I can see her appeal and what she meant to the audience and why men were intrigued by her (uhh) and as far as Frank Frank (stutter) Capra goes, he has made much better movies after Platinum Blonde",1
"Good evening, ExpoTV",1
Tonight Im going to be reviewing the DVD three hundred,1
"Right here, I have the two-disc special edition",1
Its a very good movie,1
Its a story (uhh) about {sigh} King (stutter) Leonidas and (uhh) his battle with three hundred Spartan warriors,1
Its a titanic crash and (uhh) definitely makes for a good movie,0
(umm) Pete Hammond from Maxim says its a spectacular visual feast that is inventive and groundbreaking,1
Those are noble words about a movie right there,1
"(umm) Like I said, its about King Leonidas taking on three hundred Spartans",1
We have some special features here,1
"We have additional scenes that (uhh) theyre going to say, you also have commentary with those scenes",1
"Theyre going to tell you why they dont have those scenes in the movie, why they made the scenes originally, but didnt end up putting them in the movie",0
We also have Frank Millers vision realized on film with three hundred Spartans,1
Fact or fiction,0
The shocking life of a Spartan,1
"And actual Spartan, they tell you about the life of them",1
We also have Who Were the Spartans? A little look into how they how they (stutter) casted for the characters that play the Spartans in this movie,1
This movie is rated R,1
Its got some graphic battle sequences throughout and some sexuality and nudity,1
Not stuff youre going to want your kids seeing,1
Its a bloody mess at points,1
Theres sexual stuff going on,1
"Definitely a good movie for adults, though",1
Im going to rank it one of the best out there,1
Im going to give it five out of five stars,1
Im going to suggest that you definitely pick up three hundred,1
Do not forget those words,1
"Expotv, how you doing? Nick B here",1
"Today Im going to be reviewing the DVD The Silence of the Lambs with Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, and Scott Glenn",1
This is the (uhh) special edition DVD here that I am reviewing tonight,1
It is (uhh) a great movie,1
"It, it (stutter) won an Oscar for best picture in nineteen-ninety-one",1
"It is rated R, its a very disturbing movie, not anything you want to let your kids see",1
"I saw this when I was a kid, it gave me bad dreams for weeks",1
"So definitely, definitely keep this for the grownups",1
(uhh) The approximate run time on here is an hour and fifty-eight minutes and like I said it came out in nineteen-ninety-one,1
The DVD is in color,1
We have some great special features here on it,1
"We have a brand new inside the labyrinth documentary including all the interviews with the cast, featuring Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster, and more",1

"We also have teaser trailers, TV spots and more",1
"Very, very good movie",0
"Very, very interesting to watch",0
"It keeps you on the edge of your seat, you never know whats gonna happen next",1
Hannibal Lecter is one twisted character and this movies all about him,1
"(uhh) Im going to give Silence of the Lambs five out of five stars, Im going to recommend that you see it out there expotv",1
Hi Expo this is Nicki,1
This is my review on (stutter) Johnson Family Vacation movie,1
(umm) I thought this was not all that great,1
(umm) I expected a lot more out of it,1
(umm) Especially with Cedric the Entertainer,1
"And dont get me wrong, theres some funny parts in it",0
"But overall, I think my expectations of it really were a lot higher than what I got",0
"(umm) Its rated PG-thirteen for crude humor, so forth",0
(umm) And its ninety-six minutes long,1
(umm) I think towards the end I was just really hoping it would end pretty quick,0
"(umm) Its (umm) got Bow Wow, Steve Harvey, (uhh) Cedric the Entertainer, (umm) Vanessa Williams, just to name a few of the actors that are in this movie",1
"But (umm) I, I (stutter) mean I would check it out its not a bad movie, Id probably give this a two and a half",1
"(umm) But (uhh) some funny parts in it, so check it out",0
Hi expo,1
{clears throat} This is Nikki,1
This is my review on My Date with Drew,0
(umm) Dont waste your time,0
This is a terrible movie,0
(umm) A guy (umm) whos had this lifelong (uhh) crush on Drew Barrymore (umm) decides twenty years later that hes going to make his dream come true and go on a date,0
"Okay, thats all Ill say, but thats all that matters",0
(uhh) Its terrible,1
Its actually terrible,1
"Its not funny, its not interesting",0
"(umm) Im actually kind of sad I own this movie but anyway (umm) its ninety minutes long, its rated PG",0
(umm) Who knows? Somebody might like it,1
(uhh) I wouldnt recommend it,1
"Id probably give this one a one, if that",0
"So (umm) if youre wanting to see a terrible movie just to see how bad movies can get, (uhh) this would be the one to check out",0
(uhh) My Date with Drew,0
Hi,1
Im Liz and Im here to talk to you about The Rules of Attraction,1
This is a movie that was based upon a novel by Bret Easton Ellis who of course wrote American Psycho,0
(umm) and also this,0
(uhh) Wow,1
I hated this movie,0
And I like American Psycho a lot,0
"I think its, I think its (stutter) very good and (umm) There",0
I could not hate this movie any more,1
"Well, I could probably hate it more",1
But (umm) I dont want to think about how I could hate it anymore,0
(uhh) because my head will explode,0
"(umm) Apparently, Time Magazine asked, What more could you want in a movie",1
"Well, Id like a movie that isnt completely (uhh) disturbing, disjointed, uninteresting, doesnt engage me with the characters, (umm) doesnt really have much of a plot, and just kind of meanders around",0
"This supposed, you know, world of, of, of (stutter) college, that isnt really like any actual college environment anywhere and I hate that I hate that (stutter) stories that were supposed to accept as like a dead on satire of how we live, when theyre completely off base",0
I dont like that,0
"And (umm) I dont know if its how these how these (stutter) writers, Bret Easton Ellis, if that how he perceived, perceived, I dont know, I assume he went to college",0
I dont know if thats how he perceived it or if thats how he believes it is now,0
"(umm) I dont know how much of course it was all through the movie, because I couldnt get through it",1
"I love American Psycho, and Im certainly not going to try Rules of Attraction",0
(umm) I dont really know what it was that disturbed me so much about this movie,0
It just annoyed me,0
"Part of it was (umm) the lead, James Van Der Beek, (umm) who plays Patrick Batemans (uhh) brother",0
(uhh) Its just awful,1
Hes (uhh) not charismatic at all,0
"The total opposite of, of (stutter) Christian Bale",0
Hes completely uncharismatic,1
Hes so bland and uninteresting,0
Not a good actor,1
"Kind of (umm) upsetting, not interesting at all",1
"(umm) And maybe maybe (stutter) I suppose its possible, that the whole point of (umm) this movie is just to unsettle you and make you not like it",1
"(uhh) Maybe maybe (stutter) Im just missing that, but I felt like the behavior of these characters was completely out of touch with reality and that I dont find that interesting or attractive in a movie",0
So (umm) (uhh) you may like Rules of Attraction,0
(umm) But I cant quite conceive of liking it,0
Im sitting here holding the DVD,0
Apparently my boyfriend liked it enough to buy it,1
Im going to have to have a talk with him about that,1
"(umm) This, this (stutter) just really (uhh) I just, I beg you dont go into it like I did, thinking Oh I loved American Psycho, Im gonna love this",0
Its a totally different creature and you might not like it at all,0
Hello Id like to tell you about a movie that I recently saw,1
This is a Bee Movie starring Jerry Seinfeld,1
"(uhh) This has a list of characters in here, theres Kathy Bates, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Richards, (uhh) Chris Rock, Ray Liotta, the list goes on and on and on",0
There are so many cameos of voices that you cannot keep up with them,0
"(umm) Actually I wrote them down because theres so many, Rip Torn, Larry Miller, (umm) Patrick Warburton, Larry King who often plays cameos",0
(uhh) This bee (uhh) is called Barry bee,1
"He (uhh) is the voice of, (uhh) is Jerry Seinfeld",1
"He breaks rule number one, he talks to people",1
"And so he actually talks to a florist, she saves his life and therefore she helps him find a lawyer who (uhh) basically hes going to sue humans for stealing his bee honey and from then on people are worried, the bees are worried that hes going to with people and his mother at at least (stutter) talking to the woman, that hes talking to his bee life or bee-ish",1
I thought that was kind of cute,1
"There are so many actors and actresses in this it could have been so good, it could have been like Ratatouille but it wasnt",0
So thats all I have to say for it theres a lot of one liners and they absolutely hit flat bottom theyre not funny,1
"So this is not a kids movie, its an adults movie, its a Jerry Seinfeld movie Jerry could do better",1
"Hello, Id like to tell you about Untraceable",1
"Its a movie Ive seen recently starring Diane Lane, Billy Burke, and (uhh) Colin Hanks",1
"Colin Hanks is (uhh) the son of Tom Hanks, and hes been in quite a few movies but until recently he has (uhh) had very small roles",0
(uhh) He is a very good actor and I was glad to see him in this movie,0
"As far as the movie, its about (uhh) the FBI, the the (stutter) special unit that investigates murder plots or any types of crime on the internet",0
"Welcome to the agents of cyberspace, where (uhh) Diane Lane who is a special investigator for the FBI",0
"(uhh) Actually, (umm) (uhh) she plays as Jennifer Marsh and her coworker is Colin Hanks",1
"They come across a very (uhh) terrible website where a predator actually kills his victims and its up to the (uhh) audience, or the people that work with him on the internet because the more hits he gets (uhh) by people watching the crimes, the faster the people die",0
"Its a very gory plot, he shows (stutter) (umm) some terrible scenes, some graphic, terrible, awful scenes",0
"Theyre not entertaining, theyre gross, theyre not really meant to be seen",0
"(uhh) Its sickening, its a sicko movie",0
"Its, theres nothing about it thats good",1
"(uhh) Its, the movie, first of all the plot is not plausible",1
"Second of all (umm) (uhh) Jennifer Marsh, or Diane Lane, comes across a website of I believe it was called (uhh) kill with me dot com and it actually shows a starving cat",1
The cat has actually been starved to death,1
"It shows another scene where a person is bound and it has the the (stutter) persons name branded on the persons chest, and it just gets worse and worse and worse",1
This movie actually is pitiful,0
"(umm) Its not scary, its sick, and youre going to have nightmares if you watch it",0
"Some people gave it a two, a few people were generous with a one, some people even dared put down one and a half, Im not even gonna give it a twinkle",0
"Name is Mike and this is my ExpoTV review of the film Meet the Spartans, which is basically a spoof, primarily of the (uhh) the movie three hundred",1
(umm) The film doesnt have a lot of what youd call really big stars,0
(uhh) I think the closest (uhh) big star that they have in there is Carmen Electra and only a couple parts of her are big,0
"(umm) The, this movie is pretty much a waste of time",0
"Its a spoof movie sort of like a Scary Movie (umm) and (uhh) the Airplane movies, where just its a lot of (uhh) fast paced quick one liners and things along that nature",0
"(umm) Overall, I cant give it a good recommendation",1
(umm) Most of the jokes were pretty predictable,0
(umm) There was an unfortunate situation where that Chris Crocker guy who says leave Britney alone is in the movie with a clip and then that pretty much sort of sold me on (uhh) the fact that this was pretty much a bad movie,0
So (umm) they (uhh) they probably maybe will do a sequel to this,0
Hopefully they wont,0
But if youre (uhh) looking for a good movie to see this weekend or next weekend (uhh) this is one to definitely avoid,0
"Hi, Expo",1
This is Melissa,1
You can check out my profile and my reviews at PM three two one to see what I have been talking about lately,0
{Cough} Excuse me,0
We are talking about today Naked Gun thirty three and a half: The Final Insult,1
"And I agree, this is horrible",1
It is a final insult,1
"(umm) The first two movies, I hated",1
"This one, I hated even worse",0
"So my husband and I were just joking around that if there was an option on Expo, I would click a zero out of five",1
"But theres not, so I had to go with one out of five",1
Its that bad,1
"(umm) Created by the Zucker brothers, we have the whole gang back again, Leslie Nielsen, Priscilla, Priscilla (stutter) Presley, O",1
Simpson,0
"This time, you have Anna Nichole Smith, which they (umm) in the previews, say her name over and over and over again",1
They must be so excited that shes given them her presence,0
But she doesnt do the best job acting in this at all,1
"(umm) Basically, you have Lt",1
"Frank Drevin, who is stopping a terrorist plot that could mean curtains for him, or will a simple simple (stutter) window shade be enough? (umm) Basically, we have a state of the art advance and sequel numbering are the filmmakers you love, the returning stars you adore, plus others",0
"(umm) We have Fred Ward, Anna Nichole Smith, as I said, (umm) O",0
"Simpson, just everybody from the Police Squad Files",0
"(umm) Its just not a movie I would (uhh) spend my five dollars on, basically",0
Hi guys,1
(uhh) my name is xxx and today Ill be talking about the movie Hitman,1
"(uhh) this movie was released last year and its about an agent who in the, in this (stutter) film (uhh) the name of the agent if forty-seven",1
"(umm) whose role is being played by Timothy Ol Olyphant (stutter) and he hes (stutter) basically (umm) kind of an agent who works on the other (umm) so and he he (stutter) like he is in a xxx of control and russian (uhh) kind, russian agents because (umm) he was like (uhh) he was about to kill (uhh) president and what (uhh) he was being seen by one of the witness",1
So he chased him and so this movie was quite (uhh) full of techno stuff and was kind of a blue movie where like things moved sometimes fast and sometimes slow but I would just say this movie was just an average movie and Im going to give this movie like (umm) maybe two out five,0
"Today Im going to review One Missed Call, and this is a new horror kind of movie that I guess is most similar to similar to (stutter) horror movies like The Ring The Ring (stutter), which was centered around a video tape",1
This ones obviously centered around a cell phone and one missed call,1
"Now these movies, they seem to, (stutter) like theyre not really gonna stand the test of time",0
Like you know thirty years from now most people arent going to really remember this movie,1
"And (uhh) yeah, no ones really going to think its is the best movie of all time",0
And (uhh) unfortunately you know thats the case,0
(uhh) Some people might wanna check it out for like (uhh) a popcorn kind of flick,0
"Just see it once in theaters, or maybe rent it (uhh) you know, for a night time viewing and (uhh) see if you can get scared essentially",1
(uhh) Is it an entertaining movie? That depends on what you (uhh) what your tastes are essentially,1
"If you found movies like a Jeepers Creepers or (uhh) Final Destination to be entertaining, you might find One Missed Call to be entertaining as well",1
"If youre looking for a well done kind of horror movie (uhh) you know, with goo (stutter) with high production values and stuff like that (uhh) you know, I would recommend something like The Shining or even The Ring more so than this",0
So it really depends on your tastes and how much youre interested in the horror kind of (uhh) thriller suspense genre,1
This is my review of Walt Disneys Beauty and the Beast,1
(uhh) This is the special edition two disc platinum edition,1
(uhh) This is probably my all time favorite Disney princess movie,1
(umm) I watch this with my daughters,1
"(uhh) They all love it, even my seven year old still really liked it",1
She can still watch it over and over again,1
(uhh) And looking forward to watching it with my two year old as well,1
(umm) A lot of the neat features on the two disc (umm) version are (uhh) theres a Celine Dion and xxx music video,1
Theres never before released behind the scenes footage,1
(uhh) Theres some games and (uhh) there are three different versions of the film,1
(uhh) You do get a lot of extra stuff by buying the platinum edition,1
And (uhh) But really the best part is the classic Beauty and the Beast movie,1
(umm) Definitely cant go wrong with this one,1
Its wonderful animation and the cutest characters and (uhh) really really good music,1
(uhh) My favorite songs are in this movie from (uhh) out of all the Disney princess movies,1
So (uhh) definitely one of our favorites in our Disney library and I highly recommend it,1
"Hello, my name is Sarah and I will be doing my video opinion of the Walt Disney movie Underdog",1
"(umm) This was absolutely my favorite movie (umm) of, of (stutter) the year (umm) I really enjoyed this movie",1
"(umm) Basically the title says underdog, the movie was about a canine who had an accident in a lab with (umm) a doctor (uhh) a mad scientist, and end up getting the ability to talk and have the ability to have all these great superpowers",1
"(umm) He can run really fast, and he do these really cool flips, (umm) you know it was just a lot of different things that you know, a basic superhero might have you know, strength, speed",1
Basically the dog had it,1
(uhh) He end up coming across a (umm) family who took him in,1
"And (umm) you know, basically he was just going around town and and (stutter) saving people and and (stutter) you know, trying to understand what he was going through and the abilities that he had",1
Trying to figure out how they worked and what to do with them,1
"(umm) This movie was just unbelievable (stutter) it was hilarious, it was family, it was friend, you know you can watch it with friends, family, (umm) all ages",1
(umm) It made you laugh so I really enjoyed this movie,1
All of this other stuff is irrelevant,0
"And if you want to talk about that stuff, but youre not focusing your time on ministering to others or witnessing or explaining the Gospel to other people, youre wasting time",0
We dont have time for these irrelevant controversies that detract from the Good News of the Gospel,0
People are breaking my brain because youll go onto any Christian YouTube channel,0
"Youll go onto any Christian Website and youll have somebody who is ready to fight, Oh, what are your thoughts about flat earth",0
What do you think about Flat Earth,0
"If you dont believe in Flat Earth, youre not a Christian",0
"This is What Women Want, with Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt",1
"This is supposed to be a very romantic comedy, but I find it to be ridiculous and stupid",0
"(umm) Dont rent this or buy it or ever watch it, ever, ever, ever, because its dumb",0
"And if you are dumb then you can watch it and you can be like, oh I like this movie",0
"But if youre not dumb, youll stay away from it because its stupid",0
(uhh) Its PG-thirteen,1
Its a hundrend-and-twenty-six minutes long,1
"(umm) Mel Gibson (umm) is trying to (uhh), hes in advertising and hes trying to (umm) think like a woman and he (umm) so hes dresses like a woman and whatnot, and he ends up getting like electrocuted or something, and (umm) he can hear what women think, and (umm) (uhh) so he uses that to be able to (umm) woo Helen Hunts character",1
And then he finds that he really does love her,1
"Hi, Im Valerie, and today Ill be reviewing the film Saving Private Ryan",1
(umm) Its starring Tom Hanks and its winner of five Academy Awards,1
Its a very very amazing movie,1
"(umm) It takes place during (uhh) one of the World Wars and (umm) Tom Hanks, hes in the military and he is sent on a mission to save this (uhh) Private Ryan, who is still out in the (uhh) war zone",1
And so they have to locate him and bring him back,1
"And so (umm) along the way they encounter all these different scenarios and you really see (umm) a very realistic glimpse of what the war was actually like, the end and stuff",1
"Its very very (uhh) realistic, powerful war type movie",1
"So if youre interested in films like this, and even if youre not, its definitely worth giving it a chance",1
(umm) I really enjoy this movie and its a very very nice film,1
(umm) It even has a some special features,1
"(umm) It has an exclusive message from Steven Spielberg, hes the director of this film, and (uhh) they have the cast and filmmakers bios",1
"So, its really fun to see, you know, what other films these actors have worked on",1
"So, the special features are also very fun",1
"Hi guys, (uhh) my name is Sumit and today Ill be talking about the latest released movie, One Missed Call",1
(uhh) This movie was released few weeks back and (uhh) it was not not (stutter) (uhh) good movie,0
"It was supposed to be horror, but its not that good a horror movie",0
(uhh) This is origin (stutter) (uhh) basically (uhh) movie release in Japan (uhh) in two-thousand-three and this is a remake (umm),1
Its an English version of that movie,1
(uhh) This movie starts with a story that a few people get a call or get a voicemail that how they died,1
"Like what time, what date, what place (uhh) in their previous life and they got horrified and then some sudden deaths happen and theyre all like surprised and too scared to tell everyone, And then they (umm) there was a spirit, (uhh) some sort of, in this movie, so",0
"I didnt like this movie much, so Im going to give this movie like two out of five",0
Hello and welcome to my review of the movie at the theater (uhh) Bee Movie,1
"(uhh) this is an animated film done by Jerry Seinfeld and (umm) apparently Jerry Seinfeld was working on this movie for a few years, (uhh) since hes been finished with the Seinfeld show and so I was expecting a lot more out of this movie",0
(uhh) overall I was very disappointed in the movie,0
(uhh) I thought it would be more along the lines of maybe a Shrek where it would be a movie that the kids would like but the adults would like too,0
(uhh) however its much more for the kids which was really surprising (uhh) considering it was Jerry Seinfeld (uhh) Chris Rock,0
"Another thing I didnt like about the movie is (uhh) it was kind of billed in the previews that Chris Rock was, you know, the co-star of the movie but I mean he literally probably has ten lines in the entire film and (uhh) just nothing earth shattering so (uhh) overall I was very disappointed in Bee Movie",0
"(uhh) your kids may like it but (uhh) it its (stutter) just not a movie for adults, theres no you know a lot of kids movies are do some clever things that (uhh) you know some double entendres, you know, things like adult humor slid into a kids movie",0
"Hi, I am reviewing the movie Eragon, which is currently in theaters",0
"Now I was a, Im a fan of fantasy movies so when I saw some of the commercials for this I thought alright, Im gonna go check this movie out",1
"If you youre (stutter) a fan of fantasy movies, or any type of movie for that matter do not see this movie",0
It was a horrible ripoff of The Lord of The Rings,0
(umm) It was just a mess,0
"The dialogues were horrible, performances were (stutter) awful if you ask me",0
"(umm) I thought, I dont understand how some people could approve this movie and put it out for production, it was just awful",0
"(umm) Id say about halfway through the movie, I had enough, I had to walk out",0
People before me were walking out of this movie,0
"So you know, even little kids with parents were leaving this movie",0
Thats how bad I thought it was and (stutter) apparently other people thought it was too,0
"So you know, if youre looking for a movie to see, then do not see this one, because it will disappoint and you will lose your money",0
Expo Im gonna talk about the movie Fred Claus,1
"(umm) Its still in theaters, I dont know if it is or not and (umm) it stars Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti",1
Vince Vaughn you really disappointed me with this one,0
"He usually, Vince Vaughns a hilarious guy",0
"In Fact, thats why I went to see the movie, cause Vince Vaughns in it",0
"And thats why I guarantee a lot of people went to see the movie cause they thought Vince Vaughn was in it, its probably funny",0
Its probably a hilarious movie,0
But its really not that funny,0
Its really kind of a stupid movie,1
"I mean, its not the worst movie Ive ever seen but it is it is (stutter) not that great of a movie at all",0
(uhh) I wouldnt recommend seeing it (uhh) in theaters,0
I wouldnt recommend paying full price,0
If you wanted to wait until it came out on DVD I I (stutter) would I suggest doing that,0
"But if you didnt see it at all in general, no, no (stutter) harm no foul",0
"I mean seriously, its not that great of a movie",0
"So basic plot, (umm) Vince Vaughn is, his names Fred, and he is the older brother of Santa Claus and they have the whole family thing you know cause hes brothers and they got parents and then this whole dramatic structure of how their in a relationship with family and how Freds supposed to be more like (stutter) Santa Claus, which is his brother",0
"But his his names Nick, obviously you know Saint Nicholas, his names Nick",0
"So Its this whole family kind of comedy thing about how they how they dont get along and then (stutter) the main plots really about how you know Fred (stutters) he should be more like his brother and how but Fred kinda keeps messing up with his brother and like he marks everybody on the on the (stutter), he believes everybody shouldnt get a president present (stutter) on Christmas and I mean, its just its just crazy stupid",0
"Its just stupid, okay",0
Its really not that funny,0
I dont even know what I was saying when it was a decent movie,1
Its really stupid,1
"In fact just thinking about it just makes me mad because I went to go see it and Vince Vaughn really disappointed me and I hope his next movies not like that cause if his next movies like that, Im gonna be disappointed and his Wild Wild West show just came out recently and Im not gonna go see it because of that",0
"You disappointed me and I dont know, you know",0
"So, I dont know, Vince Vaughn you disappointed me",0
"But the movies not that great, okay",0
Its terrible,0
"Expo, Im gonna get really insane about this one",0
Im gonna do a review here on Meet the Spartans,1
"Somebody kill me now, who keeps making these movies? Seriously",0
Who keeps making these movies,0
Theyre terrible,0
Dont go see it,0
"If somebody comes up to you and is like, hey, you wanna go see the movie for free? Ill pay you to go see the movie",0
"Dont go see it, its not worth it",0
"Its not worth it, youll question life",0
Youll seriously question living,0
"Seriously its terrible, it is terrible",0
Okay its another one of these movies that parodies movies and its just stupid,0
"You think they would have learned this after all the scary movies, what they made like four already? They made four Scary Movies and made this epic, epic (stutter) movie, they made this date movie",0
And this is supposedly one of the sequels to like epic movie I think,0
"But they had to be, call it, they had to call it Meet the Spartans because every movie did so bad",0
"Just, just stop making the movies",0
Just stop making them,0
Okay come up with something more original than copying other people or trying to make fun of them,0
Its just stupid,0
"So, it just made me so mad just even talking about this",1
"Giving this review just makes me so mad about this movie, so",0
"I mean here is some movies they did: Three Hundred, Chainsaw Massacre, Spider-Man Three, they parodied Britney Spears",0
"You know, they just did all this stupid stuff",0
What can I say I mean thats really about it,0
"I mean seriously just drop these parodying of movies, just a whole bunch of recent movies they parodied and (uhh) you know, who was in it",0
"(stutter) It wasnt Pamela Anderson it was, I dont know what her name even was",0
"(uhh) Carmen Elektra, (stutter) thats whos in it",0
"Just made me so mad, seriously, just stop making these movies, thats all I gotta just to say",0
"I give it like, zero out of five if I could",0
Like I give it negative,0
"Okay, I give it negative its terrible, its all I gotta say",0
Dont waste your life,0
Dont see it on DVD when it comes out,0
"Dont, if your kids like, if if (stutter) youre a parent and your kids like hey, oh well Im gonna go out with (uhh) my friends were about to go see (uhh) theyre like ten years old it doesnt even matter, but like Im about to go see it just be like no, youre grounded",0
"Like you are grounded, you go to your room for the rest of the night",0
Just because they were even thinking about going to see it,0
"Just be like, go to your room, seriously",0
"Hey guys, Im going to be reviewing The Golden Compass today",1
I saw it in theaters a few weeks ago,1
(umm) I read the book,0
"I read it several times, its one of my favorite books in the whole world and the movie is just terrible",1
It really doesnt do the book justice at all,1
(umm) They changed things in the plot around,1
They added new things,1
They took away really important facts,0
They ended it (stutter) early,0
It was just not good,1
"I mean, not even close to how good the book was",1
(umm) It did have some things going for it I guess,1
The acting was pretty good,1
"Nicole Kidman was a, she was a good Misses Colter",0
"She was pretty much how I imagined her, except for the blond hair",0
Misses Colter was supposed to have black hair but thats okay,0
(umm) The lead actress was okay I guess,0
She wasnt exactly how I had pictured Lyra as being but she was okay,1
She did a decent job,1
And they did pretty good special effects with the demons and things like that,0
"So, I guess it has those things going for it but, overall I was definitely not impressed (umm) and I really wouldnt recommend it",0
Id just read the book instead,0
Hi,1
Today Im reviewing a movie called Fourteen-oh-eight (umm) and this movies pretty sweet,1
(umm) I cant go any farther without telling you its a five out of five stars,0
Its really sweet,1
"(umm) Its a good movie, its really weird and twisted but its a great movie",0

And he doesnt believe in em cause nothing ever happens to him,1
"He writes books and stuff about it, hes a writer",1
"But (umm) yeah, basically (umm) he hears about this place and hes kind of famous, not really famous, but so so",0
(umm) People know who he is but his books are always in like bargain bins and stuff like that,0
"But (umm) yeah its really good, (umm) and (umm) oh yeah",1
"So he (umm) hears about this (uhh) hotel in New York that like anyone that stays there, like they closed it down because people always die when they theyre (stutter) in it even for like a few minutes, so (umm) cause it just makes them insane and stuff like that",1
But (uhh) yeah its a great movie,1
I dont want to give away too much but definitely check out Fourteen-oh-eight,1
"(umm) He ends up going and he stays (umm) in it, but Im not saying how long or any of that",1
"Just gotta watch it, but its (uhh) Fourteen-oh-eight and Ill show you the little clip",1
"This is more at the beginning, and theres some language and haunting sights so not recommended for kids",1
"{movie} And this is the, (stutter) he has kind of like a meet the author kind of thing going on, and hes just showing up a little bit early, whatnot, getting the deal going",1

"(umm) I dont know, it was different so I was like sweet",0
Its gonna be rad,1
"Yeah, its not that good",0
Pretty cheesy,1
(umm) Kind of dumb everything,0
(uhh) The actings okay but the snakes are so ridiculously fake,1
Like I dont know Ive seen other people say oh theyre so real,1
I think theyre so fake,1
Like you can even tell its fake,1
But (umm) basically I mean thats what the movies about obviously,0
Theres (umm) passenger plane and (umm) somehow snakes get loaded on and then they just go crazy,0
"So yeah its its (stutter) pretty adventurous and (umm) Yeah, so I dont know, Its a little different",0
Im gonna give it two out of five,0
So heres a little scene,0
"504} And this is at the beginning of the movie, (umm) well towards the beginning",0
Right before they leave,1
700} Theres a lot of language and stuff,1
Hello and welcome to my review of (uhh) Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,0
(uhh) This is an unusual movie,1
Johnny Depp seems to like to do these weird characters and just weird movies,0
(uhh) He tends to play the roles well,1
I will say that Johnny Depp again does a good job in this movie although I did not like this movie,0
(uhh) It its (stutter) kind of an unusual movie in the fact that its a musical,0
"So first off Im not big into musicals myself, you may be, so you may like it a little better but (uhh) actually my parents love musicals and they hated this movie as well, is what they told me so (uhh)",0
"I dont know, I just I didnt think the movie was, you know, it was well acted, Johnny Depp, you know, he just plays a good weird guy but other than that (uhh) the story, you know, you may be familiar with the story",0
"A guy, you know, tries to get revenge (uhh) and kills a lot of people (uhh) as a barber because hes got a mess of a willing victim sitting there in his chair so (umm)",1
"But it just, the movie didnt do it for me and (uhh) I certainly would not waste my money going to see it in the theater",0
Hello expotv land,1
"Its me, Danny Ericson, and Im here to talk to you about the film currently in theaters The Golden Compass, with Nicole Kidman, Dakota Blue Richard, and Daniel Craig, (uhh) the list goes on",1
"But I think, well I havent read the books, but the movie didnt, was really not that intriguing",1
"It was, it was (stutter) kind of an intriguing (umm) idea kind of thing",0
(umm) The soul of a person connected to a animal but I feel like the movie did not pull anything off,1
"It really wasnt its own entity, so to speak",0
"It didnt really, it it (stutter) seemed to rely too much on the viewers background knowledge of the book",0
(umm) It really wasnt that engaging and it just kept going on and on,0
It was a long movie,0
It seemed like more than two hours and (umm) probably it was (stutter) unknown to me it was only the first part of a series of movies so it didnt really have any resolution at all,0
The acting was actually pretty good,0
"Hi Expo TV Land, its me Danny Erickson here to talk to you about a movie currently in theaters",1
(umm) August Rush,1
"This has Freddie Highmore, (stutter) the up and coming young actor, as well as Robin Williams whos consistently disappointing in my opinion",0
"(umm) This movie, (stutter) it was recommended to me by some people who I thought had a good opinion, but I guess they were wrong because this was really a disappointing movie",0
Even as a family movie its just way too predictable,0
"I mean, I like the part about, I liked the musical part of the movie",0
"Because hes a music prodigy and he can create music and just has, is in tune with music and (uhh) in a special way",1
"But, the whole premise of the movie is just, just so cheesy, and its so predictable the whole movie",1
(umm) twenty minutes in I felt like I knew what was going to happen like every every (stutter) part of the movie,0
So I just thought it was (Uhh) good performance by Freddie Highmore and a lame performance by Robin Williams,0
"But it was just overall pretty disappointing movie because it got such high appraisal from some people, and I just think that its just too corny and predictable for most viewers who are looking for a, interesting movie",1
Oh Hi Expo TV I am here to review the DVD of (uhh) a great comedy from the early nineties Groundhog Day,1
"Starring Bill Murray (uhh) and Andie MacDowell and (uhh) directed by Harold Ramis who started with Bill Murray and stripes (uhh) seven years before (umm) this is one of my favorite comedies of the last say twenty years its a very simple premise done extremely well, and the simple premise is that a man gets stuck re-living the same day over and over again until he gets it right (uhh) in this case its a weather man (uhh) played by Bill Murray who gets stuck in Groundhog Day in Puxatony, Philadelphia or excuse me Puxatony, Pennsylvania (uhh) until he gets the day right",1
"(umm) Somehow they found a way to make each new iteration of the day (uhh) different, fresh and it never gets boring in fact (uhh) as you go on you wait more and more to see (uhh) the familiar scenes play out in a different way and thats a lot of that credit goes to the script a lot of that credit goes to Bill Murray (uhh) and Andie Macdowell for keeping things fun",1
"(uhh) Chris Elliott does a really nice supporting job in here as the camera man (umm) I would really recommend getting this DVD (uhh) and if you rent it, or buy it, or whatever you do (uhh) Youve got to listen to the Harold Ramis commentary track its very informative, (uhh) very funny tells you a lot about the movie (umm) little tidbits like they assumed while theyre making the movie that (uhh) Bill Murray is is (stutter) stuck in this day for about ten years",1
"So you get a sense of how long this is going on, even though you see maybe fifteen (uhh) versions of the day throughout the movie hes stuck in it much longer so you get a much greater sense of it",1
"Okay ExpoTv, its a DVD review its really bad",0
Its Dungeons and Dragons on DVD,1
Its like dont watch it,0
Its not good at all,0
I dont know why they made it,0
"It wasnt entertaining, it wasnt even like the funny kind of bad",1
I guess for the plus side (umm) its got two audio commentaries and two documentaries and deleted scenes and (uhh) special effects deconstruction,0
But why would you want to watch any of that when the movie is absolutely horrible,0
"So (umm) {noise} how do they finance this, who said, who who (stutter) was like, Dungeons and Dragons thats a good movie",0
"Marlon Wayans, yeah lets get him in there, hes hes (stutter) great at these serious roles",0
"Who, Dungeons and Dragons shouldnt have been made a, oh man, whats next, like Risk the movie? Okay, so (uhh) time for the rating",0
Zero out of five,0
Zero out of ten,0
Yeah,1
"Dungeons and Dragons, dont watch it unless youre an idiot",0
"(uhh) Its harsh words but its really not good, Im Im (stutter) bummed out I just watched it and wasted my night",0
Dont watch this movie,0
Hey expotv land,1
"Its me, Danny Ericson, and Im here to review the movie Alvin and the Chipmunks (uhh) with Jason Lee",1
"This is (uhh) a newer adaptation with computer animation of the old TV show Alvin and the Chipmunks where theres three chipmunks who sing music and perform, become an overnight sensation and if I had the choice I would not watch this movie ever again because its really cheesy and even cheesier than I thought it would be and it really didnt even, wasnt fun like the original was, the original TV show",0
"So just really wasnt what I, didnt have the same feel that I hoped that the original TV show had and its just probably not even that fun of a movie for the family to watch",0
"Kids, younger kids, dont even relate to that TV show",1
"So I would say if you have the choice to go to it, dont go cause its kind of just a disappointment",0
But (uhh) so yeah,1
"Well hello expotv land, its me Danny Ericson and Im here to talk to you about the new movie in theaters Alien Versus Predator: Requiem",1
"Now this is the sequel to the movie Alien Versus Predator which came out a couple years ago and when I watched that movie I was kind of excited because Im a fan of the Alien movies and the Predator movies and I was very disappointed by that, so Im not sure why I watched the second one but I was still surprisingly even more disappointed",0
(umm) It does include the characters the Aliens from the Alien movies and the Predator from the Predators movies but once again its just pointless seeming,0
I didnt really understand why they were fighting each other,0
"It was rated R, (umm) compared to the last one which was rated only PG-thirteen and it had a lot more blood",0
So if youre into (umm) a lot of gore thats really pointless I guess youd like this movie but overall I didnt really see a point in watching it because it just didnt seem like there was {laugh} any point to it,0
Hi,1
Im Chris and this is a review of the DVD for the movie The Hulk,1
(uhh) This movie came out a couple of years ago and I have to say that it wasnt at all what I expected and I was a little bit (uhh) disappointed with this movie,1
(uhh) I was expecting sort of a (uhh) big screen version of the (uhh) eighties television series (uhh) The Incredible Hulk (uhh) the one that starred (uhh) Lou Ferrigno as the Incredible Hulk,1
(uhh) I was always a big fan of that growing up and I really liked that show,1
This movie focuses definitely more on the comic book side of the character the Hulk,0
"(umm) Hes definitely (uhh) larger, larger than life type of superhero slash monster",1
(umm) Whereas in the TV series he was accessible and (stutter) a lot more human than he is in this movie,0
"(umm) As far as stars go, not really a lot of big name stars",0
Although Nick Nolety is in this movie,0
Im not really sure he managed to stumble into this,1
"{clears throat} (uhh) Sam Elliot is in this, (uhh) hes always good and Jennifer Connely is in it as well",1
The star is (umm) Eric Bana,0
(umm) Hes not really a well-known actor that they got to play the (stutter) lead character here,0
"Its directed by Ang Lee, an excellent director (umm) of (uhh) comic book type movies",1
(uhh) Hes done that before,0
So I wasnt really thrilled with this,1
I guess (umm) if you were a big fan of the comic book character of The Hulk you might enjoy this more than I did but (umm) I was actually looking for something else,1
"As far as the DVD goes itself, this is a two disc set",1
"(umm) On the second disc are a bunch of (uhh) deleted scenes and also a level for the Xbox game, (uhh) stuff about the motion capture suit",1
Its fairly interesting but its (uhh) nothing spectacular,0
Thats The Hulk on DVD,1
"Whats up Expo Ben Mazo here again, today Im reviewing the movie of Save the Last Dance",1
Starring Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas,1
I didnt enjoy this movie at all,0
"So if I was you, I would not buy this or rent this, its just a waste of money",0
Its (uhh) its just pretty much a chick flick about dance and drama,0
"(umm) I am, Im just not into those type of movies I mean thats just me but, if you like dance and drama movies go for it",0
"I mean, I dont know",0
And pretty much just about this girl who wants to just be a dancer and everything and she meets a friend and he helps her out and everything but,0
"Not going to ruin the plot for you or anything but I dont I dont even know if I should just ruin the plot because its not that great of a movie, I dont even want you to see it",1
"But I dont know, Im giving it one out of five stars for this movie",0
"Not a very good movie, so (uhh) dont pick it up today I guess",0
"(uhh) I mean if you like Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas I guess you could try it, I dont know",1
"I didnt like it but Ill let, everyone has their own opinion so",0
"Save the Last Dance, one out of five stars",0
Have you ever held someones dream in your hand? Hey welcome back for another episode of The Bootstrap Boutique where beginners build businesses,1
"Im glad youre here because today I want to talk about something a little meta, which is making these videos for you every week",1
"And to do that I have to tell you about one of my YouTube mentors, Amy Schmittauer",1
Thats her right there,1
"I found Amy and her YouTube channel SavvySexySocial back when I was looking for how to schedule a post to YouTube, or how to schedule a video to YouTube",1
Because I was that green and I was that new and I didnt know how to do it,1
"See back in the early days of The Bootstrap Boutique I used to shoot a video, kind of edit it, and immediately upload it and I knew that if I was going to keep doing this week after week then I was going to have to find a better way",1
So I go to YouTube and I search how to schedule a video to post on Youtube and Amy was there with a tutorial,1
I went and looked up how to do something else and Amy was there with a tutorial,1
"Every question it felt like that I had about how to do something on YouTube, Amy had a tutorial",1
She was out there providing value and showing her expertise in a way that was truly helpful for what I needed so I became a fan immediately,1
"Her videos were not only informative, they were also entertaining and that led to me binge watching them",1
"Shes got 700 and some, I havent seen them all Im sure, but Ive watched a lot of them because I was learning something with each new video",1
"One thing that I really picked up on, and I didnt know it was a thing was the way she structured her videos",1
"Her short intro, immediately giving you all the information you need, a call to action and end it",1
So theres not all this extra fluff in her videos,1
"Oh, and look, there it is right there on page 87, its Amys Authority Video Formula all about how to do a YouTube video",1
And I have borrowed from it,1
"Its why youll notice now in my videos I try to really just jump into the content, cut to the chase and not give a whole bunch of fluff and talk about whatever I was talking about in those early videos that probably had nothing to do with Amazon or selling on Amazon",1
Its also why I end with a much more clear call to action,1
"Do you remember when I used to spell our my Twitter handle at the end, whos got time for that? Nobody",1
"But if I say hey, leave me a comment you can do that",1
"Its not, leave me a comment, like this video, check out the checklist, heres my twitter handle, let me spell my email address for you I dont know what I was thinking",1
"So thank you Amy, because I needed that",1
Amys videos are all about giving value and that is absolutely something that I try to emulate in my videos for you guys,1
"So hey, heres my crystal clear call to action",1
I have a link to Amys book in the description below,1
Go click that link and buy her book,1
"Because Ill tell you, I actually am a member of Amys book squad and I got an advanced digital copy to read for a review, and I loved the book so much and I got so much out of it that I went and I bought this book myself even though I already have it in pdf",1
"One, I like paper, but also I wanted to support Amy because shes given me so much through her channel and its an awesome resource",1
"Its something that is going to be dogearred, underlined, and sticky noted all over",1
So heres that call to action again,1
"Check the link below, buy the book",1
"Hello Expo TV, how you guys doing today? I am here (uhh) to review the new blockbuster movie Vantage Point",1
(uhh) I think this movie got number one over (uhh) the weekend,1
Probably because there much else there,0
Because this movie I I (stutter) wouldnt recommend at all,0
"(umm) It does have some good actors in it though, Forrest Whitaker, Dennis Quaid (umm) etcetera etcetera",1
"Theres tons of it, but (uhh) it it it (stutter) doesnt really go anywhere",0
"(umm) It just keeps, you get tired of it kind of keep repeating itself to see these different vantage points",0
"I thought itd do that even a little bit different and better but, it didnt even do that",1
(umm) I cant recommend at all going to this movie,0
(umm) I Id (stutter) say wait for TV,0
(uhh) This just just was a bad movie,1
"(umm) Maybe a couple good spots, but not worth the (uhh) ticket price",0
(umm) That is Vantage Point,0
I am reviewing Stephen Kings The Mist and its now currently playing in theaters,1
"This movie was, it was okay",1
I mean I like Stephen King stories (umm) but this movie wasnt scary,0
"Usually scary movies are filled with psychological terror and stuff, but this one was just shows you a bunch of monsters",0
"It (uhh) the story line is basically (uhh) a mist attacks, like, an island, a small island and a bunch of people crowd into a grocery store to try and avoid the mist and, and (stutter) I wont spoil the end but the ending was (umm) {noise} kind of touching I guess, but the ending was okay",1
"(uhh) Nicely planned, (umm) just the fact that they ended up showing all the monsters that were in the mist (umm) just made it (uhh) it it (stutter) just wasnt scary anymore",0
I dont know if you can call it a horror since the monsters werent really scary,0
They were just basically like giant bugs and giant lobsters,0
Hello,1
Today I would like to review for you a movie currently in theaters called Mad Money,1
"It stars Ted Danson, Queen Latifah, and (uhh) Diane Keaton",0
"(umm) Its basically, its a light comedy",1
Its sort of like an adult contemporary comedy,0
"(umm) Its about (uhh) these three women that that (stutter) work for the national reserve and (umm) theyre just like, you know, normal women, theyre not like (uhh) thieves or gangsters or anything like that",1
"Theyre just, you know, your normal everyday women",1
"And theyre plotting to steal (uhh) this money thats going to be destroyed by the national reserve cause (stutter) of course the national reserve controls the money and, you know, sometimes money just has to be destroyed",1
"So (umm) they plot to steal this money for themselves and, you know, comedy ensues",1
"So its, like I said its a light comedy so it was, when the movie was over I was somewhat pleased and entertained but it was sort of one of those take it or leave it kind of things",1
(umm) Its a very forgettable film and like the casting isnt that great,1
"Like Ted Danson is in it so, I mean, if that says anything then I know you know what Im talking about, but yeah",1
"(uhh) Mad Money, (uhh), its okay",1
"If youre in the mood for a light comedy, if theres nothing else playing at the theater",1
"{cough} Hi, Im Mike with expotv and this is my movie review of The Hottie and the Nottie",1
And this is (uhh) easily one of the worst films ever created,0
"(uhh) For those of you not familiar with it, it is (uhh) features Paris Hilton and I believe she received top billing, so she is the star of the movie",1
"(umm) She plays a girl who (umm) years ago, when she was about six or seven years old, had a mutual crush on a little boy about the same age",1
"(umm) And we now grow up (uhh) twenty, twenty-five years later, and (uhh) we pick up the story where that boy goes back to find her and realizes that she is beautiful or perfect in his eyes but, and she would be considered the hottie, but there is a nottie who is not hot, for those of you not up on these terms",1
"And it is a girl wearing obviously bad makeup, (uhh) bad hair, bad fat suit, all this kind of stuff and the minute you see her you can tell that somewhere underneath there a makeover is going to occur",0
So (uhh) its just coming down the turnpike,0
"(uhh) This movie should be avoided like the plague, its completely awful",0
"(umm) All the (uhh) the writers (uhh) should be indicted (umm) and all the actors (uhh), you know, (stutter) tortured to some extent",0
So definitely avoid this film at all costs,0
"Hello, expo",1
Id like to tell you about a movie called The Hottie and the Nottie,1
This is a movie starring Paris Hilton,1
The only thing that really saves this movie is that Paris has her clothes on,0
"Its really a terrible, terrible movie and it shows that, once again, Paris has to be in front of the camera",0
"Shes very narcissistic in doing that because, after all the trouble shes been in and after all the terrible (uhh) X-rated that movies shes been in, Im real, not even, I dont even understand why she would want to be in a movie",1
"Why I went to see this? Actually it was a matinee, so I paid around five dollars to see it",0
"Actually, it wasnt worth a dollar to see",1
I suppose I was just curious to see if she could redeem herself,1
Shes not an actress,0
She,1
The story plots lame,0
Its a silly really it (uhh),0
Shes supposed to be the gorgeous girl that a school mate has had a (stutter) long-time crush on,0
Her girlfriend is supposed to be (uhh) uglier than ugly and cant find a date,1
"(uhh) Paris decides that she will not date anyone until she can find a date for her girlfriend, so she goes to all means to make her girlfriend (uhh) accessible and thats basically is the plot of the story",0
"We do see a lot of Paris, but thank goodness she has her clothes on",0
Thats really the only good thing I can say about it,0
Hi expotv land,1
"Its me, Danny Ericson, and Im here to talk to you about this great new movie called The Hottie and the Nottie, starring Paris Hilton and (uhh) Joel Moore",1
(umm) This is just a great movie,0
(umm) Just had great themes in it,1
I (umm) its about this guy called Nate who is (umm) Who is (uhh) who has liked this girl since he was a little boy and hes had a lot of other girlfriends but hes finally realized that Paris Hilton is the one for him,1
So he tracks her down but realizes that theres this girl thats really ugly that (umm) (stutter) that Paris Hiltons always hanging out with and that she wont go on a date without her friend whos ugly but then he (stutter) then so hes trying to find all these guys to go on dates with her,1
But (uhh) it turns out its one of the best movies of the year and I would say definitely go and watch it if youre planning on having the worst time of your life,0
"Paris Hilton in a movie? Please, come on",0
This is not a good movie,0
I dont think you should watch it,0
"One out of ten, if that",0
Hi Im Jesse and (uhh) today Im going to talk to you for just a brief moment about Stanley Kubricks two thousand one A space Odyssey,1
And I took the word brief very poignantly because this movie is anything but,0
"Its (uhh) about, yeah it says here, four thousand minutes long which it translates to over forty hours somehow and (umm)",1
"Sure its a classic and theres a lot of symbolism that you see all over in in (stutter) our culture, (uhh) especially The Simpsons",0
But (uhh) And and (stutter) of course that whole Im afraid I cant do that Dave is from this,0
"And so, you kind of have to see this at some point on your life just so you know what its about",0
"But (uhh) if youre looking to have like a nice relaxing time or if you really enjoy science fiction, (umm) spend your money elsewhere",1
This movie is immensely boring,1
Theres one part where they (uhh) go to Mars or something and they show the entire trip to Mars like unabridged,1
Its its (stutter) like four days where theyre just in stasis and the camera moves around occasionally,0
Its like a surveillance camera on a spaceship,0
Its (uhh) incredibly boring,1
"But theres (stutter) I guess theres some neat ideas or something cause I (uhh) {laugh} I couldnt, I was asleep for most of it but people just, thats what Im reading on the internet",1
Ten thousand B,0
"(umm) Im not sure what I miss more, the five dollars I spent to go see it or the two hours I spent watching it",0
"(umm) This movie was absolutely abysmal, is the only word I can think of to describe it",0
"(umm) Just the first line of the movie was just, it was just ridiculous",0
"It was (umm) (uhh) The only err only time will tell the difference between legend and truth, and youre just like, what the heck does that even mean? Does that Mean that this whole movie is just a lie? Anyways, (umm) this movie follows the story of (umm) this one guy whos like the chosen ,you know, guy, to like overthrow these Egyptians",0
"I dont, its really unclear, as they go from like Himalayas to like, a rain forest to a desert in like three days, just walking",0
"And its just its, its (stutter) really ridiculous and then theres theres (stutter)",0
"Okay theres this one part where like, where hes in like, this pit, and theres like a saber-toothed tiger in there and he was just like, Im gonna kill you",0
"Aww but wait, youre sort of trapped in these sticks, Im not gonna kill you so dont kill me",0
"And the saber-toothed tiger is like, alright thats cool",0
I dont know,0
"Anyways, the xxx in it like, werent even that cool and I mean there were like, mammoths, CGI mammoths that were sorta neat I guess",0
It wasnt visually that stunning,1
(umm) The girl wasnt even like that attractive,0
"It was just an overall disappointment but, I mean it was funny to see just cause we could make fun of it afterwards",0
Right now Im going to be reviewing The Descent,1
The (uhh) movie came out last summer and I watched it recently and I feel that it was kind of a lackluster effort by the (uhh) people who made this movie,0
Basically its about a group of women who annually go on an adventure,1
This year they decide to go exploring some (uhh) underground caves and (uhh) they get lost due to a cave in and proceed to be attacked by some weird kind of creatures,0
"The movie is really fast paced, kind of lacks a plot",0
"Theres a little twist at the end, which I didnt really care for and had a little trouble understanding and seemed a little disjointed there at the very end",0
"Hi, Im Mike with expotv and this is my movie review of College Road Trip, which was a complete utter waste of time",0
"(umm) Ever since the American Pie movies came out around ten years ago (uhh) people have been coming up with movies like Road Trip and College Road Trip, all this type of (uhh) different stuff",0
Well this one basically stars (uhh) Martin Lawrence and hes reconnecting with his daughter whos getting ready to go to college,0
"(uhh) And because Martin Lawrence is in it (uhh) its kind of funny because hes hes (stutter) a seasoned, funny, professional guy (uhh) but the movie is just watered down",1
"Its got that (uhh) really awful RV meets Are We There Yet type of vibe to it where its so family oriented, it has such, such (stutter) moments every five or ten minutes of just unfunny stupidity that its just a real challenge to enjoy",0
(umm) I would say I cant really think of anybody that might (uhh) enjoy the movie,0
(uhh) If if (stutter) you were sleeping or comatose in the film you might enjoy it,0
"(uhh) If you were in the bathroom during the whole film (stutter), you know, you might like it too but if youre forced to watch it then youre pretty much not gonna enjoy it at all",0
(umm) I definitely think Martin Lawrence needs to go back to some other funny things,0
"(uhh) Its kind of sad but, you know, you probably thought a year or two ago when you saw (uhh), if you did see, Wild Hogs youd probably think well wow, he cant get any lower but he actually did",0
"(uhh) So maybe he needs to go back and do Wild Hogs Two or just do something to get his career back on track, but but (stutter) this is just a big mess",0
Hi,1
"My name is Mike, and this is my ExpoTV movie review of the film Over Her Dead Body, which is a movie that I guess (umm) I I (stutter) dont know, words really cant describe",1
It wasnt very good,1
It might make a good date movie,1
"(uhh) But basically, the plot (umm) is just kind of, it seemed sort of TV movie-ish, like (uhh) like something that even Lifetime might even reject",1
"But basically in it, you have (umm) Eva Longoria Parker, from Desperate Housewives, and she plays a bride that accidentally gets killed on her wedding day and (uhh) her fiance slash husband from that wedding day is Paul Rudd",0
"And (uhh) he (umm) basically takes it pretty hard, as most of us would",0
(umm) And then (uhh) what happens from there is he decides to go consult a psychic and go sort of deal with the with the (stutter) whole situation in therapy,0
"And, as you might expect, the psychic is an attractive female, because it is movieland, and he starts to fall in love with her",0
"(umm) And then (uhh) from the grave, Eva Longoria Parker decides to (uhh) torture him and, and (stutter) try and break them up and everything",1
"And it it involves a lot of scenes where she (umm) is sort of, like, hovering over them or watching him and her as the new romance develops and stuff",0
So (umm) it all wraps up (uhh) toward the end as you might expect,1
I wont give anything away,0
"But (umm) just overall, its just a painful exercise to watch, not a really good movie, something that you should steer clear of (umm) even if (uhh) Im not a fan of Desperate Housewives, but even even (stutter) (uhh) the the (stutter) person that I went with (uhh) she is, and she even hated the movie",1
So just overall just steer clear of this movie,1
"(umm) If you have to entertain yourself this weekend, (uhh) buy a puzzle, maybe dogs playing poker, put it together or something, you know",1
Whats up Expo Tv,1
I have a movie review called College Road Trip,1
Came out March two thousand eight,0
(uhh) Went to see this with my younger sister,0
It was absolutely terrible,1
"It was directed by Roger Cumble and its (uhh) about how (stutter) this high student which is (stutter) Raven from (stutter) Thats So Raven (uhh) goes around the country to choose a college that she wants but her dad whos a cop but played by Martin Lawrence, (uhh) goes along with her to try and find the perfect college for her",1
"And (uhh) its just a really terrible movie to and, terrible attempt at a comedy",0
Its definitely directed towards like a younger generation cuz of like Raven was in it,0
(uhh) But it was absolutely terrible,0
I do not recommend checking this out,0
If I could give it a zero I would but I know theres no option for zero so Im going to have to give College Road Trip a one out of five and recommend that everyone stays away from this movie,0
"I dont know why they released this in theaters, it doesnt deserve to be in theaters",0
"Whats up Expo, I have a movie review for you, its Step Up two the Streets",1
Came out February two thousand eight,1
It was directed by Jon by Jon Chu,0
"Basically its like the romance, but with like dancing involved",0
(uhh) It doesnt have like the like like (stutter) (uhh) Channing Tatums not in it which pretty much made Step Up I cause like (uhh) because like the storyline was decent,0
"But this one its just like, not that good",1
People in it are like Robert Hoffman and other like people that Ive never even heard of before,1
(uhh) I wasnt too impressed with the movie,0
(uhh) It really really wasnt that good,0
Its Its (stutter) just like (uhh) like they go to the same school and like dancing brings them together,0
"(uhh) But this sequel, not good",0
Its not a good sequel at all,0
I do not recommend seeing this movie,0
Hello,0
"(uhh) For my review today Ill do Semi-Pro, the Will Ferrell new comedy out in theaters",1
"I caught this about two days ago in the evening, I went to my local theater with my friend and both of him and myself were big fans of, like, Old School and even Ricky Bobby and Blades of Glory were okay",1
"But Ill have to admit for this review that Semi-Pro xxx on the same kind of comedy and jokes all the rest of them worked on, but its almost getting a little stale",1
I hate to say it cause I love Will Ferrell but the jokes are all kind of the same youve seen before,0
"Hes attacked by an animal in one scene, the downtrodden like, you know, ABA team youve got to win games to rally the crowd and the team and I dont know",0
You you (stutter) want to like Will Ferrell but my reviews have to be mixed but negative,0
"I dont want to say skip it or, you know why not get it as a rental later on? It may not be worth the full ten dollars or nine dollars they charge for a movie nowadays",0
As the price gets up there I have to be more and more picky about what I go to and this one I probably wouldnt go to again,0
There are some funny moments but theyre far and few between,0
So Will Ferrell Semi-Pro I might recommend you just see this at home instead of in the theater,1
My name is Eric Nederland,1
And I am reviewing the movie Twenty-Seven Dresses for Expo Tv dot com,1
Yes,0
I did see this movie,1
"Not by my own choice, I was forced to",0
It was everything you might expect from such a movie,1
"Romantic comedy, about a woman who has been a bridesmaid twenty-seven times",0
"Now, I dont know about you, but I dont think Im going to be a wedding attendant twenty-seven times and I dont know how many people really will be",1
That in itself was a little bit unbelievable,1
But unfortunately that was one of the more believable plot points,0
"Now, I dont have anything against the actors, the director, I just dont think it was a movie that was worth being made",0
Everything was romantic comedy-ish,1
It was cliched,1
"Unbelievable leaps of the imagination you have to suspend your disbelief like, I dont know",0
Like an elephant was stepping on your pants,1
"If you like that sort of thing, go see it",0
Hey Expo tv this is my video review of the movie ten thousand B,1
"(umm) If you know anything about the director you know he directed Independence Day, and he also I believe directed The Patriot",0
Both those movies were excellent and I think ninety-nine percent of the population will agree with you on that,0
"However, if youre like me and you use that to say, hey, lets go see ten thousand B",0
its by that guy who directed Independence Day,0
Youre going to be highly disappointed,0
This movie is horrible,0
Its about these like people just running around doing pointless stuff that you dont care about,0
{cough} I would almost describe it as like a reality tv show from ten thousand B,1
like I dont care about this guy running around in the jungle,1
I just want this to end,0
"{cough} Theres really like, I didnt (stutter) catch too much of a plot like theres like (umm) theres this little plot thats stupid",0
The movie has no substance,1
"Its not interesting, its not gonna hold your attention",1
"And it is really long, like I dont know I dont know (stutter) the exact minutes or anything but I would say its got to be close to two hours long and that is",1
"For a movie that sucks this bad, two hours is way too much, so",1
"{cough} I dont know I mean, you can rent this movie and just fast forward it through the boring parts but, I think you would miss about an hour and a half of the movie if you did that",0
And Im not going to necessarily say thats a bad thing,0
So this is ten thousand B,0
Hi Im Tom and today Im gonna be reviewing Tyler Perrys Meet the Browns,1
As a formality heres the movie ticket,1
"Here and heres the movie ticket sideways, thats not a formality thats just for fun",0
"Alright, now if youve seen any of the other Tyler Perry movies this is exactly like it, so if you like those, youll like this",0
Its too much for me at this point if I see another Tyler Perry movie Im never gonna go see it,0
The only one saving grace for this movie was Medea,0
Medeas always hilarious,0
"I I (stutter) dont know why but Tyler Perry dressed up as a large, tall woman makes me laugh",1
"Dont know about you, but it does me",1
"Now this movie is yeah, as I said, exactly the same as the other ones, its like a love family type story",0
"(uhh) Way too many stereotypes, I I wanna (stutter) I wouldnt recommend this movie",1
Not one bit,1
I would just wait for it to come out on a network television when it gets replayed three times for a weekend and then every other weekend for the rest of its life,1
"So no, please dont go see this movie its horrible",1
"Unless you like the others then go see this, otherwise wait",0
"Hello, ExpoTV users",1
I am here to review a movie that is currently in theaters called Tyler Perrys Meet the Browns,1
"This movie, it has a good heart",1
Its about family and love and drama and has some (stutter) comedy,0
"Its basically the story about a single mother raising her children, and she really wants to keep her kids off the street, obviously",0
But she gets fired from her job and begins to get hopeless,0
"And then she finds out that a father, her father that she never even knew existed, had died",1
So she decides to take her family from Chicago down to Georgia for the funeral,1
And she meets a whole family she never knew existed,1
"Basically, it has some touching scenes",0
"It has, does have some funny scenes",0
"But all in all, it seems like hes trying too hard",0
"If youre a Tyler Perry fan, you may enjoy this movie, although I dont even like this one as much as his others and I didnt even like the others too much",1
"Its based on a play of the same name, and, I dont know, I wouldnt really waste my money unless youre a big fan of his",1
Hey Expo TV,1
Today Im here to talk about the movie Blind Mountain,1
(uhh) This movies about something you rarely rarely hear about,1
"(umm) This is about (umm) the slave trafficking, in (uhh) in particular Asia",0
(umm) This movies about (umm) young individual who is captured and sold as a sexual slave,0
(umm) This is something that goes on with reasonable frequency (umm) especially in Eastern Asia,0
(umm) This boy is taken to a remote village in China and he kinda really sees no support from anywhere,0
"Hes kind of trapped in this horrible, horrible cycle (umm) with with (stutter) no way out it seems",1
(umm) And the movies really kind of just about white slavery or Asian slavery,1
"(umm) Instead of, you normally hear about (uhh) American slavery of the African Americans",0
(umm) But this movie kind of takes another direction and kind of opens your eyes to different issues in the world,0
"(umm) As a movie overall, I thought the acting was poor",1
"(umm) The story could have been filmed a lot better I think, because its very interesting",0
I just think its hard to make that work into a cohesive (umm) watchable (umm) story,1
(umm) So the story was definitely very poor how they did it,1
"(umm) If it was purely (umm) (stutters) If it was purely historical, I think it would work",1
"(uhh) Maybe to be shown in schools, something like that",0
"But as a movie, (umm) it definitely falls short",0
"So Im gonna say one out of five stars, as a movie",0
Hi Im Tom and today Im gonna be reviewing the movie ten thousand BC,1
As validation here is my movie ticket which kinda got crumpled in my pocket I apologize,1
"There we go, yeah, front pocket",0
(umm) Okay this movie bothered me a lot just because it was really not historically accurate,0
But I dont know if they were trying to set out for that but thats the part that just confuses me,0
"(uhh) Special effects were great but the cast that, you knew nobody",1
(umm) It its (stutter) a good movie,0
"It it (stutter) follows the story of this (stutter) mammoth hunter and it, trying to do better for his tribe, or trying to get his tribe a better life",0
(umm) Its got a lot of really good action,1
"They were trying to push this as a like, the next big epic movie just like three hundred but no it didnt come anywhere close and the best part is, if you (uhh) look back to the release dates, three hundred was released the same weekend just a year prior to it",0
"(umm) So I think thats what they were really trying to push for was like the same audience, the same, oh this is going to be huge and epic",0
It wasnt that good,1
"(uhh) Three hundred was completely epic, this if if (stutter) you want a comparison just three hundred here, ten thousand BC here",0
(umm) I would rent this one or maybe ask for it for like a holiday present just so I dont have to spend money on it,0
"But the special effects are great, historically accurate no",1
Im going to give this a two out of five,0
Hi Im Tom and today Im gonna be reviewing the movie Superhero Movie,1
Before I begin this is what I need to do,0
"{slaps palm on forehead} Ok, Ill explain why in a minute, but as always I hold on to it, heres the movie ticket",1
Im ashamed I have this,1
"Alright, I dont know why I went to see this",0
I really shouldnt have,1
"I shouldve learned my lesson from four Scary Movies, Epic Movie, Date Movie",0
I shouldve learned my lesson,1
"No, I like slapstick though",0
"So I figured, okay this could be good, its got Leslie Nielson in it again and he always amuses me every single time",1
And yes he was funny in this one,1
"Airplanes amazing, (umm) yeah thats why I just like him so much",0
"Okay this kind of has Drake Bell in his first starring role, the Nickelodeon icon or whatever",0
"Hannah Montana, Nickelodeon, okay maybe not",0
(umm) He (uhh) gets into a freak accident and turns into the new clumsy superhero know as Dragonfly,0
"Okay, thats about it for the plot",0
"Yes, it is in depth as a paper bag",0
(umm) Look I got an apple,1
(umm) Okay the slapstick in it is funny,1
"As always, its not worth spending as much as I did to go see this",1
"I just had a few friends who wanted to see this, Im like alright fine, Ill go",1
"If you get into that situation, dont do it",1
Learn from my mistake,1
"As (stutter) as I had to slap myself over the head, I should have learned from the first eight mistakes",0
somewhere in there,0
"(umm) Its, as I said its slapstick funny",0
"Makes fun of all superhero movies, at least for the most part",0
(umm) What more can you really say about a really dumb movie,0
"(umm) Stick with Airplane, Leslie Nielson, you did that one great",0
Youre funnier than the rest of em,0
Please dont tag on to horrible movies cause then Ill go see them,1
I wasted so much on this,0
Dont go see this,0
(umm) Wait for it to become a budget renter,0
Not even a budget theater,0
"Not even a regular rental, wait for the rental to be there so long its now cheaper",0
Go for those,0
Just wait for that long if you actually want to see this movie,0
Thats my advice,1
(uhh) One out of five,1
Kelly and Ryan which Im super excited about its Gonna be with Colleen um,1
I just need to get an outfit so were going to go shop around you can get it up serve a look serve a look shall I,1
Whats up Expo,1
"Ive got a Denzel Washington movie right here, Out of Time",1
Didnt like this movie,1
Im a huge Denzel fan,0
I love every Denzel movie I think hes an amazing actor,1
"And he, he (stutter) is a good actor in this movie",1
(umm) Like he plays his character well,1
"Its not that, I just dont like the movie",0
The movies terrible,1
He plays his character good,1
He still is an amazing actor,1
(umm) But this movie was not very good,1
"(umm) Its got Eva Mendes in it though, which is, shes beautiful you know that",0
"And Sanaa Lathan from Blade, and Dean Cain from Lois and Clark and Ripleys Believe It Or Not",0
"So if youre into any of those, those (stutter) people I mean check it out",1
I didnt like it but that doesnt mean you wont,1
(umm) Its a cop story,1
"Denzels the, the good guy",0
Look at him on the cover,0
Hes the good guy but,0
"I just, I wasnt feeling Out of Time",1
"Expotv, lets talk about Nims Island",1
"Alright, now, its a kids movie okay? But now overall though kids movies usually are pretty good overall, like as movies",0
This movie was not,0
"Let me tell you why, alright? Now, well the acting was good, especially Abigail Breslin",0
That was the only good thing about the movie,0
"Now other times its just like the story line wasnt that good for a kids movie, you know? Normally you can go see a kids movie no matter what age you are and love it",0
"Like, I mean, all Disney stuff, everything",0
"Pixar, whatever",0
This one just it just didnt have that many elements,0
"I mean there definitely was not like any like adult humor, you know, that only adults get and stuff",0
(stutter) I dont even know if kids would like it,0
"Its just, I mean its a really fantasy movie, theres a lot of like weird stuff",0
"I mean thats cool but Jodie Foster doesnt do a great job, you know, so the only good thing about the acting is Abigail Breslin",0
And like some of the camera work is just like oh this is horrible,1
I mean on a on a (stutter) scale of like stars I would give it definitely like two stars out of five,1
"I mean if you have to see it go see it because your little kid might want to see it or something, or your little brother or sister",0
But overall its just really not worth seeing,1
I mean you could definitely take them to see something else,1
"If theyre enthusiastic about seeing it take them because, I mean, maybe they might like it but you will have to sit through something thats really youre just like I do not want to be here",0
"So I mean if you if you (stutter) have to, go see it",1
Hi guys,1
"(uhh) Today I am going to talk about a new released movie, Superhero movie",0
"(umm) This is a spoof movie of Spider Man but you can also say something, something (stutter) into account like X-man and (umm) some other movies",0
(uhh) This spoof movie is like (uhh) not that much interesting because (uhh) I dont like spoof movie that much but (uhh) I like the movies (uhh) Meet the Spartans but this movie doesnt (uhh) I I (stutter) dont like this movie much,0
"Hey, ExpoTV",1
This is Aubs eighty four,1
"Today, Im going to talk about the movie, Nims Island",1
And this stars Jodie Foster and Gerard Butler,1
"(umm) Many of you will recognize Gerard Butler from movies such as three hundred, where he played the main character in that film",1
"He plays a little more of a bit part in this film, so if youre going to go rush out to see the movie for Gerard Butler, youre going to be disappointed",1
He plays the role of a a (stutter) father,1
Nim is the main character of the movie,1
"She is a little girl who lives on this island with her father, Gerard Butler",1
(umm) Theyre kind of secluded from everybody,1
"(umm) The father is a scientist who does a lot of research and needs a lot of time for his experiments, so he doesnt have a lot of time for his daughter, Nim",0
"And to counter this, Nim has a lot of fanciful creatures that shes created",1
She has a very active imagination in this one,1
She loves to read books,0
Thats her favorite hobby,0
And her favorite author is played by Jodie Foster,0
"And what happens is, Nims father goes out to sea to do a experiment",1
A storm comes out,0
He gets lost out at sea,0
"Nim writes her favorite author for some help, saying that her fathers lost, what does she do, how does she get through life, I mean, whats her next step And Jodie Fosters character comes out to the island to hang out with Nim and try to help her cope and do things like that",0
"Now, this is not a very realistic story at all",0
"(umm) First of all, who lives on a deserted island, a deserted volcanic island, with (uhh) just a father and a daughter? Nobody does that",0
And especially when the father sails away to do science experiments and leaves Nim all by herself,0
"I mean, she cant be more than, I dont know, twelve or thirteen",1
"And for her to be alone on this island is ridiculous without a father or a babysitter, anything",0
So thats the first (uhh) ridiculous part of the movie,1
The next ridiculous part is that a letter written by a little girl to a famous author would actually solicit a visit,0
"I mean, maybe the author would write back and say, you know, thanks for the letter, blah, blah, blah",1
"But, no, the author actually comes out to the island to be with this little girl",1
(uhh) Thats also ridiculous,0
(umm) So its not very believable,0
"Its very fanciful (umm), lots of crazy stuff going on in the way of imagination",1
(uhh) Its definitely a little kids movie,0
"And if you have a daughter or a son who is probably under the age of ten, I think theyd love it because theres some imaginary creatures",1
Theres a little bit of action,1
It can be a little scary,0
I would say the storm scene might be a little frightening for some younger kids,0
(umm) But its just kind of a fun movie for the younger generation,0
"And definitely if youre an adult, dont go in prepared to believe everything",1
"I guess when I went to the film, I didnt know what to expect",0
"I didnt know that this was supposed to be, you know, a joke and supposed to be all creative and imaginative",0
"So I was expecting a lot, and I was disappointed",1
Im only going to give it a one out of five stars because theres not a lot of redeeming quality to it,1
"(umm) One of the best scenes is just kind of a touchy moment (umm) where, you know, a father and daughter have to say goodbye to one another",1
"And, you know, if thats the best scene in the movie, I think that says a lot",1
"Hey, ExpoTV",1
This is Aub eighty four,1
"Today Im going to talk about the movie College Road Trip, starring Martin Lawrence and Raven Symone",1
"(umm) Before I go into character detail, Ill give you a little heads up about what the movie is about",1
"Martin Lawrence plays a police officer who decides to go on a road trip with his daughter, playing by Raven Symone, to check out colleges",1
"And hes very worried about the kind of trouble that shes going to get into when shes away at college (umm) you know, drugs, sex, parties, things like that",0
"So basically the movie revolves around how he tries to keep her away from these kinds of things while theyre on the road trip, and he definitely is trying to pick out a college that is clean and well-run and not going to lead her astray",1
(umm) Many of you will recognize Raven Symone,1
She was a child actor on a lot of TV shows,1
(uhh) She has a couple of movies out,1
And I was actually surprised to see how much shes grown up,1
"(umm) Obviously, shes of college age for this movie, and I think she does a much better job of acting now than she did when she was a kid, (uhh) maybe understandable, a little more training, a little more experience could do a lot",0
"(uhh) Martin Lawrence is in his typical role, kind of a wise-cracking humor (umm) lots of situational gags, some physical comedy",1
"(umm) I would say that if youve seen a Martin Lawrence comedy, youve seen this movie",0
Its very similar,0
(uhh) One of the best parts of the movie is a scene where (umm) Martin Lawrences character finds these coffee beans and he thinks theyre drugs,0
And so he feeds them to this pig and the pig goes crazy on caffeine,0
"So that was kind of a situational, physical, ha, ha, ha bit",0
"And that was one of the funnier scenes of the movie, unfortunately",0
I guess theres just not much that hasnt been done for kind of the college road trip type deal,0
"For instance, theres a movie called Road Trip, a movie called Eurotrip",0
"And while those were all teenagers and, and (stutter) more a little about drugs and getting drunk and sex, its still the kind of same humor, where people drive around and they say funny things and theres a parent you try to avoid because they will get you in trouble",0
And that just felt like the same thing for this movie,0
Definitely not one of my favorites,1
There wasnt anything new in terms of comedy,0
No real humor that really got me rolling or anything like that,0
No special effects,1
Soundtrack is debatable,1
"(umm) There was one good song, many okay songs, and a couple songs I just wondered why they were even on the soundtrack, what a waste of my life",1
(umm) Im only going to give this movie a two out of five stars for all of those reasons,1
"If you do have to see it, I would say rent it",1
Dont rush out to see it in the theaters,1
"Hello, everyone",0
Playing over my shoulder is this,1
This is Freejack,1
This is a terrible movie,0
(umm) I first heard of this movie (uhh) when a friend of mine in grade school decided to (uhh) rip off its storyline for a (uhh) short story that he had written (uhh) in grade school,0
He (uhh) lifted (uhh) large elements of the plot,0
"And (uhh) as he was explaining this in front of the class, I thought to myself, huh, that sounds an awful lot like Freejack",0
"And (uhh) (uhh) this movie storyline and his storyline are as follows: (uhh) Emilio Estevez plays a race car driver who (umm) just as he is about to die in a (uhh) horrible race car driving accident, he, his (stutter) body is snatched into the future, (uhh) thanks to (uhh) a billionaire Anthony Hopkins",1
"And (umm) the reason Anthony Hopkins character does that is so he can take his (uhh) mind and implant it into the body of Emilio Estevezs character, thus giving him eternal life or some nonsense",0
"(umm) Also in this movie is Rene Russo, who was in Lethal Weapons three and four, and the Thomas Crown Affair",0
"And (uhh) also in this movie, in addition to her, is (umm) Mick Jagger here, who was in The Rolling Stones and still is in The Rolling Stones",0
And his performance is terrible in this movie,0
"(umm) He has one facial expression, and it pretty much consists of this",1
"(uhh) Anthony Hopkins is in this movie very, very barely",0
"(umm) I think for like the first half of the movie, at the very least, hes not even in the same room with any of the other main characters",0
He communicates with Rene Russos character (uhh) via a (uhh) telecommunications device,0
"And hes (uhh) either in, like, China or (uhh) France or something",0
And the backdrop is just some mad painting and it looks terrible,1
"And (umm) he really, really, sincerely, honestly phoned in his performance",1
"I honestly think that in, in (stutter) like the final third of the movie, or whatever, in the latter half of the movie, I actually think its more like the final third or the final quarter, when he actually is in the same room with Emilio Estevez and Rene Russo",0
"I, I (stutter) honestly think that they just used a body double for him so that he did not have to be in the same room with anyone else",0
And I think they just shot his coverage separately,0
It just has that feel to it,0
"(umm) Yeah, this is a, a really stupid movie, and me and my friends used to get together and (umm) watch really awful movies like this and just talk over them and make fun of them",0
And (uhh) this is by far my favorite one,1
"I think this was the last one that (uhh) that me and my friends in (uhh) Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, watched before I moved to Chicago",0
And (uhh) I have fond memories of watching this tremendous piece of crap with (uhh) my friends before moving,1
"ExpoTV, lets talk about Tyler Perrys Meet the Browns",1
"All right? First of all, Tyler Perry, quit making stuff",0
Quit making TV shows,0
Youre not funny,0
No one thinks youre funny,0
Its stupid,0
Let me tell you why,0
"All right? Now, the premise of the movie, Meet the Browns, is extremely stupid",0
I highly recommend going to see anything except for this movie,0
All right? The acting was not that good,0
The writing even wasnt that good,0
"All right? All right, now, all right, the acting was okay, but the writing wasnt good, and theres nothing new about the screen shots, the cinematography",0
"All right? Theres, like, no reason to see it",0
There is not one reason to see this movie,0
"In my opinion, I think you could spend your money and, more importantly, your time elsewhere or in a different (stutter) movie in the theater, or dont even go to movies",0
"Go do something else, because this movie is not good",0
"All right? Seriously, whoever cast this movie, not good",0
"And Tyler Perry, this is a message from me to you",0
"Do not make movies, because theyre not good",0
"Everyone on ExpoTV, please do not see this movie",0
Its not worth your time,0
Hello everyone,1
Playing over my shoulder is this movie,1
This is Munich which was directed by Steven Spielberg,0
(uhh) It stars Eric Bana as a (uhh) the the (stutter) leader of a group of (uhh) Israelis who are given the task of killing the eleven Palestinians who (uhh) were responsible for the nineteen-seventy-two (uhh) Munich massacre of (uhh) eleven Israeli athletes,0
It was based on the (uhh) book Vengeance by George Jonas and (uhh) I really didnt like this movie that much,0
"It (uhh) really didnt (uhh) involve me at any kind of, you know, serious emotional level",0
"(umm) Its supposed to be about the (uhh) the toll that murder takes on, you know, normal people and (uhh) again, I I (stutter) like I just it didnt really surprise me that these people were experiencing regret that they were killing, you know, people even though those people themselves (uhh) may have deserved it",1
"(umm) That that (stutter) revelation really didnt blow me away that they were feeling that way and (umm) and I I (stutter) have a personal rule that if (uhh), you know, you dont really know the names of characters you cant really get that involved with them, and in all honesty the only two people whose names I remember from this movie are Avner who was (uhh) Eric Banas character and Carl who was played (uhh) (umm) by (uhh) Ciaran Hinds (uhh) in this movie and (umm) I really didnt (uhh) I I (stutter) like I I (stutter) really didnt have any kind of emotional attachment to any of the characters in this movie",0
(umm) I I (stutter) was really unaffected by it,1
(uhh) Geoffrey Rush is in it and (uhh) he was alright and (umm) Daniel Craig who was James Bond is also in the movie but (uhh) there there (stutter) were some genuine moments of like tension and excitement and (uhh) but in all honesty it really didnt add up to much for me,1
"It it (stutter) just, the movie just went on and on",0
"It was about two hours and forty minutes long and it just (uhh) I just became less and less invested in it as time progressed and (umm) it was, it was (stutter) just an okay movie",0
"So I I (stutter) really, I I (stutter) dont really recommend it",0
There are better movies by Spielberg,0
"Schindlers List, Saving Private Ryan, any of the Indiana Jones movies although thats like comparing apples and oranges",0
"But yeah, this was just (uhh)",0
"Hey, expo tv, this is Aubs eighty four and tonight Im going to give a review of the movie A Four Letter Word, which is currently in theaters",1
"(uhh) This is a more independent film, so many of you wont be able to find it at your major theaters",0
"If you have an independent or unaffiliated theater near you, this is where youre going to find this movie",1
It its (stutter) a gay movie,1
It follows the story of a two gay gentlemen who end up (uhh) hooking up and trying to make a relationship work,1
It starts out where one of the guys is kinda macho man,1
Hes (uhh) hes (stutter) all about the guys,1
He sleeps around a lot,1
Hes never been tied down,1
Hes afraid of commitment,1
Hes just out to have a good time,1
"And hes got a lot of (uhh), you know, friends with him who kinda do much of the same",0
"However, one time he goes into a bar and he meets this guy, and his name is Stephen, who is exact opposite",1
"Hes, you know, all about lovey-dovey, commitment, relationship and the two end up falling in love together",0
(umm) The story is mostly about how they try to deal with being in a monogamous relationship (uhh) when the one guy kinda isnt very used to that,1
It deals with a lot of homosexual issues (umm) in terms of acceptance and they try to deal with love in their own way and how the mainstream doesnt really accept that a lot of times,1
"(umm) While while (stutter) the homosexual aspect is kind of brought up in this movie, and it it (stutter) is influenced (umm) by the mainstream, most of the movie focuses just on the two guys relationship and how they try to make it work",0
"It it (stutter) pretends as though its just a normal couple who are doing a normal thing and never mind that theyre homosexual, theyre just out trying to (umm), you know, have a loving relationship and go on",1
"I think thats kind of refreshing actually because (uhh) I found (uhh) a lot of the homosexual movies focus too much on, you know, the idea that theyre being persecuted or that its so hard to be gay in todays society or, you know, theyre always looked down upon and they struggle through life",1
"And this movie, while it kind of hints at that a little bit, its definitely not its main focus and it its (stutter) barely touched upon, actually",0
"There is a lot of profanity in this movie, (umm) so if youre worried about that I wouldnt see it",0
(uhh) Not a lot of overtly sexual content,0
"(umm) Obviously, youre going to see a bunch of good looking guys in in various states of undress, but not any, you know, graphic sexual depictions, or anything like that",0
"(umm) There is a little bit of race issue in this, too, because one of the guys is white and one of the guys is a minority",1
"So its interesting to see not only are they gay and struggling to deal with that, with each other, theyre also (uhh), you know, the race issue comes into play a couple of times, as well",0
So theres kind of a lot of dynamics going on here,0
(umm) One one (stutter) of the main things I didnt like about the movie is that the two main actors arent very good,0
I dont think they get into their roles enough,0
"(uhh) Theyre homosexual in real life and so that aids them in playing gay men, but I dont think they embody their characters well enough",0
They dont make you feel like theyre actually who they say they are,0
"(umm) If youve been left feeling empty by other movies before, you know what that feels like when a character doesnt sell it right you kinda, you know, youre left hallow",0
"Youre left like, Well I paid good money for this",0
"Why arent they going to, you know, work hard for me? And I think youll get that a lot in this movie",1
"A supporting cast, I would say is equal to that or even worse",0
"(uhh) Some scenes, Ive see, I mean guys looking off just kinda bored and like theyre not even wanting to be part of this movie",0
"And I, if youve seen a lot of movies, you kinda know what that looks like and you can kinda pick up on that",0
"(uhh) Maybe if you havent seen as many movies, you wont notice some of the supporting actors being bored",0
But you will notice the main actors just kinda not flowing very well together,0
"(uhh) I havent seen any other movies with either of them in it, so I dont know what theyre normally like",0
"I dont know th if this is, you know, how they are in all their movies, or if they just werent into this movie",0
"And the two main actors (uhh) actually were writers of this movie as well, so it makes me think, that its not that they werent into the movie, its just kinda how they act",0
Which is kinda disappointing,0
"I would have liked to see it with a more well known lead actor, (umm) who really wanted to get into the role",0
Im only going to give this a one of five star,0
Dont worry about seeing this in theater,0
Rent this one,1
Theres nothing that youre going to miss,1
"(uhh) And youre gonna save a few bucks, as well",1
"(umm) If you dont like gay movies, if you dont like the homosexual issue, obviously, this isnt gonna be a movie for you",1
"(umm) But if you dont mind that kind of thing, and youre into a little light discussion about how, you know, a gay couple tries to make things work, you might be mildly entertained",0
"Whats up, ExpoTV? I saw a movie called Dont You Dont Mess With the Zohan",1
"(uhh) Its starring, I guess, Adam Sandler",1
"And (uhh) you really dont want to even mess with this movie, to be completely honest",0
"It was absolutely terrible, probably one of the worst movies Ive ever seen in theaters",0
"(uhh) Its its its (stutter) about how how (stutter) this guy, hes, like, this, like, secret agent, but he fakes his own death, and he moves to New York City and (uhh) he wants to be, like, a hair stylist, but then he also still has, like, his, like, spy skills, where he can, like, beat people up, like like (stutter) crazy, in crazy ways and stuff",0
"(uhh) Its supposed to be, like, one of those, like, I guess outrageously funny movies, and it really, like, wasnt",0
The the (stutter) preview pretty much shows you what the whole movie is,0
"(uhh) Like that trailer (uhh) he kicks people really weird thats, like, not realistic, like, hes supposed to be, like, this super super (stutter) agent, super hair stylist",0
"And its just like, kind of like making fun of, like (stutter), everyone, but its, like, really stupid",0
"I I (stutter) thought that, like, Adam Sandler was starting to make better movies, but, like, hes definitely gotten worse and worse",0
"(uhh) So I really would not bother with with (stutter) You Dont Mess With the Zohan at all, like, not even on DVD, absolutely nothing",0
"(uhh) I dont know where he got the idea for this, but it really is absolutely terrible",1
"(uhh) It has, like, the same cast as all his other movies, like, Rob Schneider, people like that",0
"But, like but like (stutter) the story and the whole plot, it was just absolutely terrible",0
So (uhh) I would have to give You Dont Mess With the Zohan (uhh) one out of five,0
Do not see this movie,0
Please dont see it,0
Hi,1
(uhh) Today I am reviewing the movie Incredible Hulk which is currently playing in theaters nationwide,1
"(uhh) Now Incredible Hulk is a sequel to the movie, The Hulk and (uhh) let me tell you I wasnt a big fan of The Hulk but I saw all these trailers of Incredible Hulk and it looked so much action packed that I decided to go watch this movie",0
(umm) I think that would be the biggest mistake that Ive done this year of actually going to watch watch (stutter) this movie and (uhh) let me tell you this again that you know all these movies that are coming out in summer (umm) you know which are really anticipated and what not,0
I am sure Incredible Hulk is the worst of all of those which have already released and which are going to release again so its really bad and let me tell you why,0
So Hulk ended somewhere that you know so he hes (stutter) (uhh) kinda running away from the army and what not so this movie starts that this guy now wants to cure himself and (uhh) hes not in North America anymore,0
Hes somewhere in Central America hiding away from the army because they still want him,0
"And (uhh) out of whatever less than two hours movie, only ten minutes is when you know the hulk is actually on the screen, the rest, its this guy planning how to, kind of you know, get away, cure himself (uhh) from being the hulk because thats basically his heart rate goes up and he turns into the hulk",0
"(uhh) Another thing that the trailers showed was was (stutter) another guy, (umm) you know the size of hulk and looked really evil and I waited pretty much the entire movie for this guy to show up and he just showed up for the last ten, fifteen minutes and I I (stutter) pretty much slept in the movie you know",0
"I was sleeping forty minutes into the movie, was that boring",0
"(umm) Because I thought of it as action packed, it was not",0
"Another thing I noticed (uhh) was the animation part, it seems that they have just focused on the bodies of these two you know the Hulk and the evil guy",1
"The rest and you know, the blast and the helicopter crashes and what not",0
The animations was really poor,0
"Like you can tell its, its (stutter) computer animated and its really bad",1
Like I would expect this kind of animations back in the nineteen-nineties but it is two-thousand eight and no one expect that kind of animations,1
It was really disappointing,0
(uhh) The the (stutter) direction was okay and the acting was okay but the story line was (uhh) (stutter) The story just didnt move at all,0
"It, it (stutter) was just there and it was like you know they could have ended the movie in ten minutes if they wanted to",0
There are two types of people in this world people who like M,1
Night Shyamalan films and people who do not like M,1
Night Shyamalan films,0
I am one who does,0
This is a completely unbiased review against M,0
Night Shyamalan,1
I actually loved his first three films,1
"I mean, I loved his first three films",0
The Village and Lady in the Water were complete letdowns for me,0
"And I said to myself, if this one, The Happening, is not as good as his first three, I am going to say Im not going to go see his movies anymore",0
And I think thats the way its going to be,1
The movie was absolutely terrible,0
"It wasnt, like, the worst movie ever made, like some people are saying, but it was pretty awful",1
"(umm) The idea, as far-fetched as it is in the movie, is probably the best part of the movie",0
"The idea he came up with for the movie, that was probably the best part",0
"But everything about the movie, the dialog, the acting, the casting (umm), the pace, the tone, the plot, where it goes, the scary moments, the gore, all that that I just named is awful",0
It is just awful,0
It is just awful,0
"Now, I have to make this review kind of short",1
And I wish I could I could (stutter) talk longer,0
"I could probably go on for, like, ten minutes about it, but I cant",0
"(umm) Im going to tell you really fast why thats all bad and, like I said, the best part about the movie was just the idea",0
"(umm) Even the, even (stutter) how long it was",0
It was only an hour and a half,1
"And I know a lot of movies are an hour and a half, but this one was really cut down",0
"It could have, it could have (stutter) gone on for two hours",0
"And I think thats what it should have been, but it wasnt",0
"I mean, it was, that was a complete disappointment",0
"You also dont care about the characters in the movie, if they die or not",1
You dont,0
"I mean, I could go on forever, but sorry",0
"The, (stutter) Mark Wahlberg is in this movie",1
"Okay? And you think hes going to be, like, this awesome actor, but, you know, this is his worst performance of his career",0
"And Im sorry, Santa",0
And he holds the movie up,0
And thats very sad,0
"Its the worst performance of his career, but yet he holds the movie up",0
"Hes probably the best one, best best (stutter) actor in the movie",0
Thats sad,0
"Zooey (stutter) Deschanel, just stop",0
Just stop,0
I dont even know what to say about you,0
"Just take a year off and get your head together, because that, that (stutter) movie, it was just absolutely terrible",0
"Your dialog, delivery, and everything about what you did, everything, everything about what you did was absolutely terrible",0
"(umm) The storyline and the way it was written, like I said, the idea was good, but M",0
"Night Shyamalan, take a break",1
Seriously,0
"Come out with a movie every three years, maybe every four years even",0
(stutter) Just take more time on your movies,0
"You seriously, this could have been, had so much more potential and it went nowhere and you didnt care",0
You really didnt,0
"It was, it was (stutter) laughable",0
It really was,0
"And the, the dialog was probably one of the, if not the worst part of the movie, besides the acting, which was really bad",0
"Dialog, delivery, and just the dialog had a, how you wrote it, it was absolutely awful",0
It wasnt realistic at all,0
"(umm) It was so bad, it was absolutely terrible",1
"(uhh) What else? {Sigh} I, Im (stutter) sorry",0
I really cant say anything good about the movie,1
"Even, even, (stutter) another thing I just wanted to end with",0
"You think its going to be a scary movie, but its not",0
"Theres only one scene where youre holding onto your seat and youre about to, you know, like, those scenes where youre waiting to jump? Theres only one of them",0
Theres only one scene,0
It doesnt even last that long,0
"And you think, well, its R-rated, so theres going to be a lot of gore, right? Theres no gore",0
Theres absolutely no gore,0
"Every time you think youre about to see gore, it just cuts to a new scene",0
You dont see anything,1
Ive seen more gore in the trailer of this movie,0
Okay? Its pathetic,0
"(umm) I really, you know, like I said, I really wish I could go on forever about this movie, but, in a nutshell, I do not recommend this movie",0
"All those reasons, plus a million more (umm) that makes this movie so bad",0
And the casting,0
"Im not saying Mark Wahlberg is not a good actor, because he is, but, first of all, not in this movie",0
"And then, he doesnt play this character at all",0
He should not play this character at all,0
Okay? Because hes a science teacher,0
"Okay? You do not, Mark Wahlberg, hes not a science teacher",0
"And it doesnt matter that its a movie, were not going to believe that",0
So I do not recommend seeing this movie,0
And I am an M,0
"Night Shyamalan fan, well, at least I was",1
Not after this movie,0
I doubt Im going to see any more of his movies,0
The only reason Id recommend seeing this movie is probably to laugh,0
"And thats, thats (stutter) completely honest",0
"And I will, I really wish I couldnt say that, because I do love the guy",1
"Like I said, I did",0
But I cant,0
I cant,0
I really cannot recommend this movie,0
I cant say anything good about it,0
So do not go see this movie,0
It is laughable,0
You are seriously wasting your money,0
Okay,0
You seriously are,0
"It is, is that bad",0
Hi guys,1
(umm) Today Ill be reviewing the movie The Happening,1
(umm) This movie just released this week and its been directed by M,0
Night Shyamalan and written by M,1
Night Shyamalan,0
And so most of you know M,1
"Night Shyamalan hes famous for some movie like (umm) the one of the great escape, (umm) Sixth Sense",1
(umm) But he also made some movies like the Lady In Water,0
"So I, so in my mind it cause kind of mixed feeling like whether its gonna be like (umm) The Sign or its gonna be like The Happening",0
"(umm) So xxx I just, I went to the theater to watch this movie and let me firstly tell you its not that good movie",1
If I were rate Sixth Sense as a ten out of ten I would give this movie just like two out of ten,0
"Because (umm) in all the movie you are just like (umm) they theyre (stutter) gonna open suspense, theyre gonna open the suspense now, now, now but",0
(umm) To a standard movie for still like a misleading (umm) a storyline,1
So in this movie (umm) the main leading character a science teacher played by Eric Moore (umm) the character Erik Moore is being playing by Mark Wahlberg,1
And he is the main leading character,1
(umm) In this movie he is shown as a science teacher and to his point of the (stutter) amusement that (umm) he found that something strange is happening all around the northeast (umm) coast of the country,1
(umm) So they they (stutter) cannot figure out whats actually happening,0
"(umm) So in the movie you see like (umm) something return two or three and depressing xxx say totally sharp so if you are taking your children be careful because there are gonna be some scenes which could be like, so many people dead lying on the street or hanging on the tree",0
So thats a little scary and you dont you dont (stutter) want your children to look at those (umm) scenes,1
So warning for that,1
"(umm) So this movie (umm) like, I do not want to disclose the suspense but there is a bit of suspense in this movie (umm) that this, only this guy was saved just from the whole northeast coast just so the guy was like",0
and then after sometime like xxx show up that this guys letting his (umm) regular life and then the same thing happens some other place,1
(umm) Thats thats (stutter) the point where the movie ends,1
So in this movie (umm) I would just say that (umm) probably gonna give this movie like a two out of five,0
"Because the movie (umm) yeah, the most important thing I wanna share about this is that the starting of the movie, it just happened like real fun that something is happening, something is happening its not like you set a bag down and then start on the storyline",1
So and in the first scene they have shown that something is happening to the city,0
And so that scene is continued to the end of the movie,0
So as I say Im gonna give this movie two out of five,0
"Hey Expo TV, today Im reviewing The Happening",1
(umm) This was one of the worst movies Ive ever seen and thats not even a lie,0
"Ive Ive (stutter) seen a lot of really bad movies, I walked out of a couple movies",0
And I would have walked out of this one if I hadnt been praying for M,0
Night Shyamalan to pull something at the very end,1
"(umm) Mark Wahlberg was terrible, he will never get a job after this hopefully, because he was so bad in this movie",1
And M,1
Night Shyamalan wanted this to be campy and like a two hour long Twilight Zone and with even worse actors than they had back in the day,0
"(umm) They were actually really good in Twilight Zone, this is this is (stutter) that was a insult to the Twilight Zone this is a terrible movie",1
(umm) I know people are rooting for M,0
"Night Shyamalan I know that you know, he hasnt made a movie since Lady In the Water, god forbid that movie too",1
"Hes just on, (stutter) he hit his peak at twenty-three years old, like this kid he he (stutter) doesnt know what hes doing any more",0
"The Sixth Sense was a beautiful movie, it was a beautiful film I love that film",0
(uhh) Unbreakable was pretty good,0
"(uhh) Signs, awesome",1
(uhh) And then there came The Village which was not great but it was still okay,0
There was the twist there we counted on M,0
"Night Shyamalan for that, we were like, oh its the twist and then it came and youre like (uhh)",1
"But you know what, that was okay",0
"Mainly Lady In the Water which was just an atrocity, and The Happening was even worse",0
Its people running away from wind,0
Yup,0
For twenty-four hours and thats it,0
"Theyre just running away from wind because its carrying, well theres actually no real (stutter) explanation really but they think the trees are trying to poison them because it makes the part of their brain, some chemical part in their brain shut off (umm) so they all kill themselves",0
So I think what M,0
"Night Shyamalan really wanted to do was make a movie where he could just have people kill themselves in the most creative ways possible, because thats all this was",0
"And it wasnt even that gory, like",0
"It could have been so much more, it really could have been but Mark Wahlberg just killed it, he killed it",0
"It, he was so unreal in this movie",0
"I mean even in one part an old ladys like, youre gonna kill me in my sleep and hes like, what, no",0
"Like come on, have some emotion, like, dont sound like me {laughter} sound like a man whos like (uhh) and Zoey Deschanel I like her too but she just did a very poor job in this movie",0
"But like I said maybe he meant it to be really campy and really silly and if he did, good job",1
"But even then dont go see it, dont even see it as a satire, its not worth it",0
Its a terrible film,0
Terrible,0
M,0
"Night Shyamalan has got to get back on track, we need another Signs, we need another Sixth Sense, we need another Unbreakable",0
"These were all great films, these were amazing films",0
"He can get back into that, I dont know whats wrong with him why is he doing this, Im really pissed off at this movie",0
I was looking forward to this film all summer,0
"I was so psyched about it because I figured it was the comeback, its the first R-rated movie, its gonna be grotesque, its gonna be twisted, its gonna be awesome",0
"No, do not waste your money on this film",0
Dont even waste renting it on DVD,0
"If it comes on cable, see it then",0
"Thats all I can say, dont do not (stutter) see this movie",0
Theres nothing more I can say,0
I give it one star because its the lowest I can go but if I could go lower I would,1
"The Happening, dont see it, it will waste your time and it will make you so sad for everyone involved, especially M",0
Night Shyamalan because I dont know,0
He must have a stroke or something between films because this is just so bad I dont know why he thought this would be a good idea,0
M,0
"Night Shyamalan get your act together and Mark Wahlberg, (uhh) go back to Marky Mark thats what you gotta do but do not go back on film",1
"(umm) And Zoey Ive got hope for you, but dont trust M",0
Night Shyamalan again,0
"Okay, The Happening, do not see this film",0
Whats up expo tv,1
(uhh) I have a review for a movie called The Happening,1
(uhh) This movie recently came out about two weeks ago,0
Its and its (stutter) rated R for violent violent (stutter) images,0
"(uhh) Its like a, its starring Mark Wahlberg",1
(uhh) Thats all I really recognize from the movie,1
"And its from like the producer of (uhh) or, of like (uhh) Signs and this, (stutter) Sixth Sense",0
"And (uhh) the movie is about how theres this like, (stutter) parent, this like, random thing and just, (stutter) like threating off like like like (stutter) it, like basically every person",0
"And its just making them do crazy stuff and like everyones just like dying and stuff its really, really weird",0
"(uhh) But it was interesting but it was like kind of like, this cant be happening like, what like, whats going on why are all these people just going crazy",0
"Because like, just something in the like, air or something",0
So I thought it was kind of like weird,1
But you but you (stutter) guys might like it,0
"(uhh) It was I guess it was like definitely along the lines of Signs and like Sixth Sense, of those movies",1
But it wasnt as good,0
"It was just like, a little bit more like violent and I guess thats why it they rated it R",0
"But (uhh) its not like scary, it doesnt really freak you out or, or nike huarache so myself so if youre looking to go see a scary movie, do not see this this (stutter) movie",1
Its not good,0
So so so (stutter) I would have to give The Happening a two out of five,0
Whats up Expo TV,1
I have a (stutters) movie review for a Mike Meyers new movie called The Love Guru,1
Came out last week,0
Like theres been a lot of trailers for it,0
(uhh) its ninety minutes long,0
"Its rated PG-thirteen for crude and sexual content, language, some violence and drug references",0
(uhh) The movies about how he was adopted by a by gurus,0
"Like who are basically like, like, like, (stutter) they know everything about dating and love and stuff and (uhh) like he gets sent on this mission to like, I guess help out a marriage between between (stutter) Toronto Maple Leafs player and like his wife because his wife has been seeing a guy from from the Los Angeles Kings",0
So (uhh) Its So its like so its like (stutter) how like hes like trying to help out this marriage,1
But like it really doesnt work cause its supposed to be really funny,0
Its like Mike Myers does stuff like Waynes World and like Austin Powers and stuff,1
So like this movie isnt supposed to be like a romantic comedy or something,1
"Its like just like a, really dull comedy I thought",0
I really dont like Mike Myers that much,1
I think hes definitely overrated,1
"And this movie it (stutter) should, like the trailer should not be getting as many like slots, like during commercials that its its (stutter) like, getting cause its really not good",0
"(uhh) But see it I guess, if you like Mike Myers",1
"Its not as good as like, its not as good as Austin Powers or anything",0
But (uhh) Its called The Love Guru,1
(uhh) A couple cameo like appearances from from (stutter) players on the Toronto Maple Leafs and from the Los Angeles Kings so check it out if you want to,0
"Hello, my name is Mike, and today Ill be talking to you about the movie The Love Guru starring Mike Myers",1
"As formality heres my movie ticket, and there we go",1
"So, whatd I think about this movie? Mike Myers is usually pretty funny",0
"I mean (uhh) Austin Powers was pretty hilarious, almost all of them were",0
(uhh) Waynes World was funny,0
Love Guru not so much,1
I mean its not that Love Guru doesnt have at least a few funny jokes,0
"Its just primarily that most of the movie is really crude and, you know, for a guy that usually does humor thats a little better than this, I mean it can be slapstick and silly, but not usually quite this level of just crude stupidness",0
Makes you wonder what hes thinking when he decided to make this movie,0
"You know I always thought that Austin Powers was pretty juvenile, but in reality it was actually a fairly good level of intellect",0
"Sort of a James Bondy joke, you know? And you really only realize this after watching this movie when you go Oh",0
It could have been a lot stupider,0
"Which is exactly what this movie is, its stupid",1
"Its about a guy, India, wants to learn to be, you know, a guru so girls will like him",0
"You know, its even the line that he uses in the preview",0
"So, you know, he becomes this guru and sort of this idea of like ahh its the horny, chastised love guru",0
"Hes kind of a dork and the stuff he says is just sort of ridiculous most of the time, and the advice he gives is horrible and sorta questions whether or not its any good at all",0
"In reality I really feel this movie is like, yeah, (umm) its about on par with some of the stupid Saturday Night Live sketches",1
"You know, not even the good ones, but about the stupid ones",1
"Which, you know, are best tolerated for about two minutes",0
"So a full length movie is really hard to pull off with this premise, you know? The premise itself might have been good, might have been workable, but this is definitely not a workable version of it",1
So Im going to give The Love Guru a one out of five,0
(umm) Rent it maybe? See it at a super budget price maybe? But (uhh) its questionable whether or not you should even do that,0
"So Love Guru one out of five for being a very crude, very juvenile adaptation of a not so great premise",1
"Hello, playing over my shoulder is this movie",1
This movie is called The Signal,1
I didnt like this movie and Ill tell you why,0
"Its because three people, three different people, wrote it and directed it (uhh) all separately",0
"(uhh) It utilizes pretty much the same cast from beginning to end and its about (umm) (uhh) some sort of a strange signal that is (uhh) broadcast from an (uhh) unspecified source (uhh) over television waves and (uhh) radio waves and cellular phones, and regular phone lines",0
"And (uhh) it just drives people insane, it (uhh) makes them want to just you know, wig out and start killing each other",1
"And the first third of the movie I really enjoyed, I thought it was a really solid setup (umm) for a pretty good horror movie",0
It felt like something along the lines of twenty-eight days later,0
"And it just, it felt really solid and like it was going to be a good movie",1
"And in the middle of the movie (umm) tried really, really hard (uhh) to be funny and failed spectacularly",0
"(uhh) It was it was (stutter) not funny at all, I like maybe laughed, Id say maybe five times, one time pretty hard at something that happened, (umm) but (uhh) over the course of forty minutes laughing five times at a part that is (uhh) supposed to be funny from start to finish, (umm) that just doesnt, didnt cut it for me",1
(uhh) So (uhh) and there was one character in particular that was just incredibly annoying (uhh) in the middle of it,0
His name was (uhh) Jim Parsons and I absolutely hated him,0
(uhh) There is no way that any normal human being would invite him to a party,1
(umm) Im going to hold this up here to block something out,1
"{laugh} (umm) Yeah I really didnt like this movie at, at, at (stutter) all",0
"The first third of it was, was (stutter) pretty good",1
The middle of it totally ruined everything that came before and after it,0
"And (umm) the final third was mixed, it was okay",1
"(umm) Special features (uhh) include (uhh) deleted scenes, a making of (uhh) featurette, and (uhh) yeah plenty of making of featurettes and (uhh) directors commentaries, so (uhh) (uhh) I I I (stutter) dont recommend the special features, (uhh) I I (stutter) cant because I didnt watch them because I didnt like this movie (uhh) enough to watch them, so I dont recommend this movie",0
Hey whats up Expo TV? (umm) Stephen Boyd here (uhh) here to talk about a movie I saw about a week ago,1
"(umm) And I was hoping I would forget about it, thats why I havent done a review on it yet",0
(umm) It was a depressing experience (uhh) to say the least,1
"It was a movie called The Happening, and it was bad, it was really really bad",1
"(umm) Heres the thing, it was written and directed by, I can never say this guys name right,M",1
Night Shamylan I think,1
M,0
Night Shmamalan or something like that,0
But anyways,0
Its written and directed by him,0
You all know him,1
He did The Sixth Sense,0
He did Signs,0
(umm) Those movies,0
"And I really love those movies and I, I (stutter) though, you know his other movies werent as bad as people made them seem, you know they werent like fantastic, but this movie is just terrible",0
(umm) Everyones making a big deal because it was his first R rated movie,0
"I was like Oh okay well, you know theres a reason its probably rated R and it just kinda sucked",0
Like I was hopping thered be more violence because if you go to a rated R movie about like,0
Oh yeah I guess I should tell you a little bit about the plot,0
"Basically its like a family on the run from like this, this (stutter) natural crisis thats taking people over and like making them kill themselves in really horrific way, and in the previews you see like three or four people killing themselves and youre like oh my gosh thats really intense, this is gonna be a really intense movie",0
"But no, the the (stutter) three or four times you see it happening in the previews are the only times it happens in the movie",1
"So basically you could save yourself the time, go on Youtube and watch the preview of the movie, and you would get all the most intense parts of the movie in that preview",1
(uhh) The rest of the movie (stutter) stunk,0
"(uhh) Mark Wahlberg, terrible, terrible actor",0
So unbelievable,0
"Dude is so bad, its just like embarrassing, some of the acting he does",0
"And (uhh) yeah, it just wasnt good",0
"And he, M",0
Night Shamalyan is always in his own movies,0
"Which, sometimes its not bad",0
In this one its just like stupid,0
"I dont know, hes not a very good actor either",0
But (umm) dont even rent this movie,0
It was so bad,0
Theres so many better things you could do with your time,0
"You could like, go watch (umm) all the videos that Expo TV rejected for two hours, or an hour and a half, and that would be a better (uhh) better way to spend your time than to see this movie",0
So one out of five stars for this movie,1
It really let me down and also because I gave him a chance,1
"I was like oh, I like your other movies, Ill see this one",0
"Really disappointed, dont waste your time",1
"So we’re the Ohio state university, so we definitely have a passionate feel for all our big ten colleagues out there.",1
And every time we see a transcript from a comparable institution then we know that students that come from the University of Illinois are well prepared.,1
I just returned from the movies,1
If you want to waste your time go see one called The Love Guru,0
Thats G U R U,0
"Guru, okay? Has Ben Kingsley in it",0
"Its got Mike Myers, hes the, the (stutter) main character",0
"(uhh) Jessica Alba, Justin Timberlake, Jessica Simson",0
Simpson,1
Its got a few others in there (uhh) that you will probably have heard about and usually when a movie has a lot of different people in it that you know about its usually not gonna be very good and this one wasnt,1
Mike Myers is absolutely awful,1
"He (stutter) co-wrote this movie from what I understand and its just, its just absolutely horrid",0
The best thing about the movie was that its only eighty-seven minutes long so you dont have to endure too much,1
"Its supposed to be a comedy but youll go in there and youll be waiting to laugh but you never will, and then itll be time to go",0
So I wouldnt recommend this movie at all,0
Id say (stutter) theres much more movies out there that are (uhh) so much more better than this,0
"Hey expotv, today Im gonna review the movie thats currently in theaters (umm) and that movie would be Hellboy Two",1
"(umm) Hellboy Two, I wasnt all that excited to go see this but you know, people are going to see it so I was like, whatever Ill go and it definitely didnt live up to even my low expectations",0
I thought it was worse than what I thought it would be,0
(umm) By the way the subtitle to this movie is Hellboy Two and the Golden Army,1
Pretty much its more just rampaging through Hellboy beating people down and saying clever little phrases,0
"(umm) I dont know, something about the whole Hellboy theme I dont really like, personally",0
"You know, its another one of these blockbusters from a comic book",0
"So you know if youre a, if youre (stutter) a Hellboy fan youll probably like it actually, but if youre just a general viewer I highly doubt youll enjoy it, just because you dont really have any connection to it and its just not good",0
If you dont have a connection it probably wont be good cause its its (stutter) just annoying,0
This is Blood: The Last Vampire,0
Its a anime,1
Its considered like a masterpiece,0
A lot of people highly recommend this,0
"I watched it, I didnt think it was that great",1
"They even made a series after it, based off of the movie",1
"The story, by the time it got started, it was already over",0
It didnt actually start taking root til the very end of the like the last thirty minutes of the movie and by that time it was already over,0
"The animation, the graphics of it, it was it looked really good in some parts, and it some parts it looked horrible",0
But a lot of people praised it for its graphics at the time,0
"I, I (stutter) didnt see it so much",0
(uhh) Id say it was the average anime,0
"Hey, ExpoTV",1
"Aubs eighty four here today to talk to you about the movie the Ripple Effect, which is currently in theaters",1
(umm) This movie is kind of low budget and doesnt feature a lot of well-known actors or actresses,1
(uhh) Forest Whitaker and Minnie Driver are the two that I recognized and that I have seen in other films,0
"(umm) The basic storyline of this movie is that there is a Hollywood (uhh) director and his life has kind of fallen apart, his marriage, his finances, his relationships",0
Everything is kind of going downhill,0
And the idea is that these changes kind of ripple out and affect all aspects of his life and lead to new things,0
"So just like if you throw a rock in a, in a (stutter) pool of water, (umm) the ripples kind of go out and they alter and affect all the water around them",0
"In the same same (stutter) (uhh) stance, when his personal life kind of falls apart, it ripples out and affects this guys professional life as well",0
"(umm) Fortunately, though, this guy does not let that ruin him or bring him down",0
"It actually leads to a sort of awakening or revival, and he sets out to change a few things and to make his life better and to try to take, take (stutter) things into his own hands and do what he can to right all the situations",1
"Now, I dont know if this movie is (uhh) very well done, quite honestly",0
(umm) It kind of seems like Minnie Driver and Forest Whitaker have had much better performances,0
"And the main actor in this one also, even though Ive never seen him before, I have to believe that hes had better performances like this",0
He doesnt seem to embody the character very well,1
"I just dont picture this guy as as (stutter), I dont (stutter) picture the actor actually being this guy, going through this really hard time and, and (stutter) struggling through his life, as he deals with his marriage and everything else",0
"He doesnt sell it very well, in other words",0
(umm) A poor job in that respect,0
"And I think that, like the movie says, ripples out and affects the rest of the cast as well",0
"(umm) As I mentioned, the supporting actors and actresses kind of dont live up to the billing, they dont live up to (umm) what they could have done and what they have done in some of their other roles",1
"So I was let down, quite honestly",1
"(umm) I had heard little about the film before I saw it, but what I had heard was positive and, and, (stutter) your know, uplifting and thinking that it was going to be a good movie",0
"(umm) But, like I said, everything put together here wasnt",1
The soundtrack was downer,1
It was kind of depressing in parts and it just didnt rebound to give the highs to the positive notes of the movie like it should have,1
"So even though it, the music dragged you down with a sad part of the movie, it did not bring you back up when it turned around and got happy",0
"And I dont want to ruin anything, give away any plot spoilers or anything like that, (uhh) but things, you know, get better",0
"When, when (stutter) he has an awakening, you can kind of expect that things are going to look up from there",0
"One thing to make the movie better, I think, I think (stutter) when it goes into the actual writing and directing, I dont think the writer or director brought out what they could have in these actors and actresses",0
"Now, the writer just writes it and kind of leaves it at that, but a lot of them tweak it (uhh) based on what the (umm) actors and actresses input is",0
"So, for instance, if they think this scene might work a little bit better this way, or if the director suggest that (umm) this scene might be better dialogued this way, you know, the writer writes that in and makes changes",1
But I just dont see that being done,0
"Maybe he was just given bad advice and made changes for the worse, or maybe, like I think, the actors, actresses, and director just werent in this one wholeheartedly",1
Im only going to give it a one out of five stars,0
Not a whole lot of redeeming quality about this movie,0
(uhh) Save your money,1
"ExpoTV, this is Aubs eighty four and Im going to talk to you today about the movie The Doorman, which is currently in theaters",1
"(umm) This is a very low-quality film, very low budget, nobody (uhh) of any kind of (umm) ability actually in acting is in this film (umm) no well-known actors, no well-known actresses, nobody directing or even writing it that you probably would have ever heard of",0
"It follows the story of a doorman in New York City, or basically a bouncer at one of the clubs",1
"And hes very popular, very well known",1
"(uhh) He kind of goes on a big power trip about how he can get people into this club and how he knows all these people and blah, blah, blah",0
And its all about him and his life and hes so cool,0
"(uhh) But eventually, he loses his job and he comes crashing down to earth (uhh) when he loses his job because he realizes he pretty much has nothing to go on",0
"(uhh) The people he knew and were so friendly with, I mean, they dont talk to him anymore since the, he cant get them into any clubs",0
They were basically using him for (uhh) his position at the door,0
And they werent really friends at all,0
"And he kind of tries to come to terms with this, has to get a grip on things and realize whats actually going on in his life and what he has going for him",1
"Now, that that (stutter) may sound like it has some potential and it may be going somewhere and it could be, you know, some big story about self-revelation or interesting of the fact that he knows all these people and it could be synopses of peoples lives that come to the club and the information he can get from them, and, you know, just kind of cool, it could be kind of like a back, (uhh) behind-the-scenes type of cool thing about these popular people",1
"(umm) However, its nothing like that",1
Its actually quite terrible,1
It is basically a big ego trip by this doorman guy (umm) and how he wallows in self-pity and self-realization when it turns out that he actually has nothing,0
"The writing (umm) was pathetic, (uhh) quite frankly",0
The story goes nowhere,0
Its basically a big circle,0
"He wakes up one day, feels sorry for himself, tries to get over it, cant, goes out, gets shunned by these people hes tied to, comes back, and crashes, gets drunk and is worthless",0
Gets up the next morning and it goes around in a circle again,1
"Gets up the next morning and it goes, anyway, you get the idea",0
It keeps going round and round and round,0
Same thing over and over and over again,0
"Not worth seeing, not worth renting, not worth wasting your life over, quite frankly",1
"The soundtrack is nonexistent, for the most part",0
"Not that it could have added much to a movie like this, but still, at least maybe some good music would have redeemed it in a small way",0
But not even that,0
So its all downhill,0
(umm) Nobody can really act in this one,0
"It all keeps, seems very staged, very set up, nobody is acting natural, nobody is getting into their roles, and nobody is meshing with one another",1
Its almost as if theyre all competing with each other to get a space and to try to get themselves known so they can go to Hollywood and make a real good film,0
"I would say that this movie should have gone straight to DVD or straight to the garbage, quite frankly",1
(uhh) One out of five stars is what I have to give it because I cant give a zero out of five stars,0
Do not waste your time on this one,0
Hi,1
Today Im reviewing Hellboy Two,1
Its currently playing in theaters right now,0
(uhh) I went to go see this movie (umm) and it was a big disappointment,0
From the trailers it looked (uhh) really action packed and exciting and (umm) kind of like a fairy tale with a darker side,0
But (uhh) when I saw it I was just unimpressed,0
"(umm) The little side jokes werent funny at all, and the acting was just kind of so bland and just the overall presentation and performance of everything about this movie it just wasnt satisfactory for me",0
And I just expected so much more from it,0
So I didnt enjoy it a whole lot at all,0
(umm) If I had to give it a rating Id say its a two out of five for me,0
(umm) It just (uhh) I didnt enjoy it,1
It had so much potential and it could have been a whole lot better but it was just pretty poorly done,0
"And so I wouldnt recommend to see it, but (umm) I guess the target audience would be people in my age group",1
"(umm) Young people in their twenties, thirties, or young children like teenagers, or even little (uhh) ten-year-olds they may enjoy this cause its (uhh) I mean they may find the jokes funny but I didnt",0
It was just (uhh) not adult humor I guess,0
"And (uhh) so, yeah",0
Didnt like it,0
Thats it,0
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,0
Im gonna just come out right and say it,0
Do not go see this movie,0
It fails on every level possible,0
They shouldnt have not even made the movie,0
They probably even shouldnt have made the second one to be honest,0
"And (uhh) theres, I cant really say one good thing about this movie",1
"(umm) The casting, Rachel Weisz, is not a return a big problem there",0
Big problem,0
It really has an effect on the movie,0
You dont love the characters as much cause the original actress that played Brendan Frasers wife is not back,0
Brendan Fraser just fails entirely,0
"Hes not funny anymore, hes getting older, and the whole hero guy who tries to be funny with the one-liners, just just (stutter) stop",0
"Just, its terrible",0
"The plot it has nothing to do with the first or second Mummy anymore, which is you know, its a good idea you know? Maybe get away from that",0
"But you dont care, you really dont care about the tomb of the Dragon Emperor, this Dragon Emperor guy, you dont care",0
"(umm) The special effects are way too over the top and not only are they over the top, but they are fake",0
You can its its (stutter) insulting,1
It is insulting the way they are,0
"(umm) And Im not trying to be like, mean about it like you need to do better but they do need to do better",0
I mean the public is so used to special effects and computer effects now that we expect a lot more and we are being insulted by this movie,0
"Everything about it, the special effects you can tell are fake and theyre just trying to put so much action on you and and (stutter) CGI and special effects that like the movie and the plot just are completely lost and theyre just trying to throw that to make up for it",0
So really and it doesnt make up for it at all,1
So I do not recommend seeing this movie,0
"It was in a way it was entertaining, in a way",1
But really its not worth your money,0
"I I (stutter) think if you took your kids to go see it I think I think teenage audiences or them might enjoy it but really, its that great a movie",0
I think its (stutter) I think its gonna fail (umm) on all levels,0
Really I dont think its good at all,0
"Really, I mean just, you gotta go see it",0
You gotta know what Im talking about,1
Its just old,1
"The Mummy franchise is dead, or they need to reboot it or something because Brendan Frasers one-liners in all this stuff, its just the publics not gonna take it anymore",1
"Its really boring, its old, its cheesy",0
"It it (stutter) was old five years ago, seriously so just stop it",0
"(umm) I guess the good thing about the movie was it was it was (stutter) so it was it was (stutter) so like bad that it was entertaining cause like, you kinda lose yourself in it in the fact that its not real",0
"I mean obviously its not gonna be real, you know, a mummy coming to life but like its just so over the top that its like somewhat entertaining you know what I mean",0
Like its just so unbelievable that you just gotta sit back and kind of enjoy the ride while you go along with it,0
So thats thats (stutter) one good thing Id say about it,0
Other than that though I do not recommend this movie at all,0
Do not go see it really,0
Do not waste your money on it,0
"Or if youre going to, go see matinee or something cheaper, seriously",0
"I just, I think youre gonna get bored with it",0
"Its just too much CGI, too much action and its its (stutter) over the top, it really is",0
So dont go see it in my opinion,1
Its not good,1
"Hello everybody, my name is Mike, and today Ill be talking to you about the movie Curse of the Dragon Emperor",1
"As formality, here is my movie ticket",1
"Here it is again, and this time in slo-mo",0
mommy vision whoo,0
Alright so the movie is called Curse of the Dragon Emperor,1
(uhh) Thats not what it should be called,1
"It should be called, why do you keep making this series",1
"The first one was alright, I will admit that",0
It was actually a fairly good movie,0
And from that point on theyve all been sort of been downhill,0
With this one probably being the worst one,0
This is probably gonna go down as one of the dumbest movies ever made,1
"So basic premise, (umm) in the distant past a few thousand years ago",1
Chinese Emperor was imprisoned in a sort of suspended animation cryogenic state,0
Except for without freezing,0
"And, so him and his army are disguised as the Terracotta Army and the guy from the first previous movies are (umm) accidentally wakes him up and now that guys gonna try to take over the world",0
"Yeah, so number one, theres no mummy, technically",0
"(uhh) Number two, thats not that clever of a plot",0
"You know, its its (stutter) sort of clever, youre like, oh well, I can take like vaguely historical things and sort of thread it together to be something (umm) junky",0
But thats really all that is,0
"Its not that great, cause really even in the end, its just a vague rehashing of the previous ones",0
So the story itself is not done very well,0
"It just, they didnt add anything new to it for me at a previous incarnations, besides the old, lets just set it in a different location",0
"And its not in Egypt anymore now, its in China",1
Its still the same thing,0
No one does a very good job on their acting,0
Not a single actor whatsoever,0
"So, dialogue is bad",0
"I havent mentioned that yet, but I am right now",0
"Dialogues bad, actings bad, the storys bad",0
"And (umm) so yeah, this series needs to stop",0
Its not worth seeing,0
"I, this isnt worth seeing",0
Its not worth renting,0
"Its not even worth seeing at your friends house, for free",1
Its stupid,0
Let it die,0
Dont go see it,0
"At least that might convince people, hey we should stop making these movies and maybe make something new for once",0
"So this has been Mike, saying hey, its not good, dont see it",1
"One out of five, boohoo",1
Im going away now,0
"Hey, hey",1
My name is Mike and today Ill be talking to you about the movie Swing Vote,1
"As formality, here is my movie ticket",1
And there we go,0
So the basic premise of this movie is as follows: Kevin Costner plays a character who is just sort of the (uhh) lame sort of loser,0
"He, you know, doesnt really give a care about anything",1
And (uhh) so his life is just sort of passing him by,0
"His daughter tries to get him to vote, so he goes and votes, and it causes a screw-up that la-de-dah-de-dah",1
Big surprise,0
Causing it so that his vote is the one that decides the presidential election,0
Okay,0
"Well, thats a pretty unlikely-sounding premise, but lets run with it for a second",0
"So then the rest of the movie falls upon the idea of, hey, look at him becoming blobbity-blobbity, look at him deciding the election, all the things that sort of happen",1
Everyone is trying to get his opinion,0
"He cant really decide, for a while, doesnt care",0
He starts to care a little,0
"And (uhh), well, its supposed to sort of have the message that everyones vote matters and voting is important and look at the American political system",0
"If anything, all it does is bore people of the American political system even more",0
"This movie is dull, dull as dirt, duller than dirt",0
"If there was something duller than dirt, that would be it",0
"Its, theres nothing really exciting",0
"Kevin Costner put in an all-right performance, but thats not enough to save the fact that this movie just isnt very good",0
You know? The premise is sort of laughable,0
"The implementation is meh, thumbs down",1
"And so then youre just end with, you know, its a political movie thats supposed to be like, oh, sort of satirical a little, but its not very satirical",0
"So what you end up with is they took a movie that, they took two movies, really, one thats sort of the Disney culture movie of, hey, look, were making a family-friendly movie",0
"But that fails because its boring and cant hold anyones attention, a child or an adult",0
"And then they sort of had a sort of, hey, lets make a satirical political movie",0
And that sort of fails because its not well done,0
They didnt satirize (stutter) anything to a sufficient degree,0
"You know, it just sort of felt, so then you try to put it together and neither one succeeds",0
"So, Swing Vote, Kevin Costner, one out of five",0
"You know, the only reason I liked this movie in any way, shape, or form is because I like reviewing bad movies",0
"So, Mike here, saying one out of five",1
Goodbye,1
I went to the movies to see Pineapple Express,1
"It wasnt my choice of movie to see, but I was outvoted on that one",0
It was okay,0
(umm) I Im (stutter) really not into movies about stoners and drugs and stuff like that,0
And thats what the Pineapple Express movie is,0
"(umm) It stars Seth Rogen, who has been in just about every (uhh) movie lately, it seems like",0
He was in the movie Stepbrothers,1
"(umm) He was in the movie, the voice of a, one of the characters in Kung Fu Panda",0
He was in Knocked Up and Superbad,1
And hes really making a name for himself lately,1
I just didnt really think this was the best movie to go see,0
(umm) Pineapple Express (uhh) the movie got its name because thats supposedly the name of a new new (stutter) strain of marijuana,0
And (uhh) (uhh) and they talk about that during the movie,1
Its definitely not for kids,0
Its just for adults,1
"(umm) If youre not into what I would call a drug movie, you probably wouldnt like it",1
It was okay,1
It passed the time,1
Its not one that I would recommend to people to go see,1
They would probably find another movie that they would like better,1
Hello,1
I want to talk to you about Death Race starring Jason Statham,1
(uhh) This movie is sort of a B movie by design,0
"It is produced by Roger Corman who is very famous for directing a lot of movies, especially during the sixties and seventies",1
"Its basic plot story, you know, you take (uhh) some cars and some women and a hero and throw it all together, throw in some violence, and you have a movie",1
And that was basically his career,0
He produced (stutter) a lot of car movies back in the day,0
He actually produced one called (uhh) Death Race Two-thousand,1
"(uhh) Some people thought that this was a sequel to that movie, or a remake of that movie",0
Its not really,0
Its got some similarities but its not really what I would call a remake of that movie,1
"This movie involves a man (uhh) (stutter) or a hero, Jason, who is accused of killing his wife and he has to go to prison",0
Hes wrongly accused I should say,1
And (uhh) once there he gets involved in sort of a underground race to the death (uhh) with the prisoners,1
And the plot beyond that is basically there is no plot beyond that,1
"Theres a lot of explosions and a lot of violence, and (uhh) the action is pretty good but all in all I kind of miss the plot",0
I I (stutter) like some of the older B movies but but (stutter) when they try to update it and kind of make it into an A movie but keep the B movie plot it just didnt work,0
College,1
"Starring, who cares? Written by, it doesnt matter",0
It doesnt even matter anymore because this movie is absolutely terrible,0
"It is like this movie reminds me is is stutter almost exactly like the American Pie Band Camp, the American Pie Naked Mile except ten times worse and the fact its in theaters and not straight to DVD or straight to the trash",1
"Really, if you pay money to go see this movie I dont even know anymore",0
"In the trailer they compare this movie to like, you know, Animal House and American Pie how they were for teen comedies",0
"This movie has absolutely no comedy compared to that, it obviously theyre trying to go for young audiences, young adults because theyre going to have sexuality in it, of course they do",0
"Theyre going to have, you know, language, nudity, and drinking, drugs and all that stuff cause its, you know, college, whatever",0
"This movie is not funny folks, start to end",0
The story line you dont care about anything,0
I absolutely hate this movie,0
I cant even describe,0
"Not only should of it went straight to DVD, if that, it shouldnt have been made, it shouldnt even have been thought of, okay? Really, it is that bad",0
"It is, like, what I can compare it to is a straight to DVD American Pie Presents, thats what its trying to be",0
"And it is not funny or anything like the American Pie series or Animal House or, you know, Revenge of the Nerds like it do in the trailer",0
"The story line is about these freshmen who, or is about to be freshmen, seniors in high school and theyre going to freshman orientation, okay? And they meet up (stutter) you know frat boys and all this and they become friends with them and they meet up with sorority girls and all this and then sexuality flies and then oh they get, you know, in trouble with the frat boys cause, you know, conflicts arise with the girls",0
It is absolutely terrible,0
"And not only is the story line terrible, the comedy is not funny, get this through your heads",0
"It is not funny, okay? This movie is aimed at young adults who really have nothing better to do with their money",0
Please go see another movie or do not see this movie at all,0
"Please, please, I am begging you",0
Do not see this movie,0
So if you think its going to be anything what college is like it is no,0
"Just because, you know, there, you know, theres theres (stutter) drinking in college does not mean anything thats something happens in all of them, this is completely so cliche and such one of those college movies that just, you know, exaggerates everything a hundred-million times",0
"Really, its an exaggeration of everything",0
"So please, dont go to see this movie, its not funny",0
"Seriously, thats all I got to say",0
Im reviewing Shopgirl the DVD,1
"It is a movie made off of Steve Martins novella that he (stutter) wrote and it is about a girl that is torn between two lovers and she cant really decide between which one, the rich old man or the young man",1
(umm) Neither of them are really going anywhere,0
And I would not recommend this movie,0
It is a rated R movie and it has lots of sex,0
Not really that much in the language department but it was just a very blah movie and it was supposed to be a romantic comedy but I didnt see that it was funny in any way and it was not a movie that I would recommend for anybody to go see,0
"So if you like Steve Martin even, its not the Steve Martin that you would think youre getting",0
"It is maybe more of the Steve Martin that is in (umm) that movie I cant think of what its called, not Grand Canyon but anyway",0
(umm) About people in LA but Ive lost what Im gonna say,0
Hey Expo TV,1
"Today Im here to talk about the movie in theaters, Mirrors (uhh) featuring Kiefer Sutherland",0
"After seeing this one (umm) recently here, I pretty much got what I expected from it",0
"(umm) And what I expected was a poor cliche (umm) horror film with bad acting, bad plot (umm) trying to, you know just trying to scare you and failing miserably",1
Thats exactly what this movie was,0
(uhh) The premise for this movie is Kiefer Sutherlands character (umm) takes up a job as a night watchmen in a burnt out department store,0
And theres mirrors in this department store,0
"And (uhh) in the mirrors, naturally he sees horrific images",0
"(umm) You know, demonic images",0
He sees himself (uhh) like being tortured and stuff like that,0
"(umm) And I dont wanna ruin the pathetic plot of this movie (umm) but obviously he has to confront whats behind these visions in the mirrors and discover why its happening, how its happening, how to stop it, why its happening to him",0
Actually he needs to enlist some help from his friend Amy,0
(umm) And its just kind of your classic (umm) bad horror film,0
"It wasnt really scary, very very predictable (umm) and poor acting",0
Kiefer Sutherland (umm) does a very bad job in this film with his acting,0
Hes not convincing,0
The fear hes supposed to be conveying to the audience doesnt seem real,0
It seems very forced,0
"(umm) It seems like hes expecting what hes seeing (umm) which obviously as the actor he is, but as the character he supposed to be, hes not supposed to expect it so it doesnt really fit",1
(umm) Combine that with bad language also in the film and this movie just goes downhill,0
So Im gonna say one out five stars for The Mirrors,0
(umm) Dont waste your time with this horror flick (umm) much better ones out there,0
"Hey all, its the king of movies here, and today Im going to review The Clone Wars",1
And this is a new movie (uhh) produced by George Lucas and its part of the Star Wars series,1
"(uhh) Its, its (stutter) CGI animated and (umm) this movies (uhh) basically a different take on the the (stutter) Star Wars (uhh) story",0
It branches off in a way,0
And (uhh) I thought this movie was actually pretty disappointing,1
"(umm) Its not too surprising though because the last three (uhh) the three new movies in the Star Wars episodes, episodes one through three were pretty (umm) awful overall",1
"And this (uhh) sticks to that (uhh) same beat as (uhh) the story is, is (stutter) pretty weak",0
The dialogue is just horrible and it didnt seem like this is a movie that you would expect to see in theaters,0
"It seemed more like a movie youd, youd find on like TV, Cartoon Network or something like that, like a (uhh) ninety minute feature length (uhh) straight to TV movie",0
"(uhh) I wouldnt suggest watching this movie unless youre a huge Star Wars fan, and even at that I would (uhh) I would only suggest watching it on TV or DVD or something like that",0
Its not worth watching in theaters really,0
Unless youre a big fan of (uhh) the other (stutter) Star Wars related (stutter) early movies,0
"Hi this Matt movie review for Momma Mia this movie is pretty much a movie all about Abba, their songs and starring Meryl Streep and and (stutter) I dont know, I dont know why I thought this movie would be interesting, I didnt realize I didnt see the preview to the movie I heard that it had the songs in there I thought well this will be interesting and I dont like musicals so this was hard for me to watch and one big problem with it is the actors are singing the songs and you know their voice arent the best (umm) Meryl Streep she does a pretty good job actually she doesnt act very good in this movie, her actings like so so, and her singing was pretty good, couple of songs pretty good (umm) so you you (stutter) might enjoy this if you like musicals (uhh) I know a lot of people did enjoy this and they really were excited about seeing this and actually wanna see this again for me I wouldnt want to see this again (umm) I didnt really like the movie, and I thought they couldve I thought Meryl Streep could been done could been done a lot better at this (umm) Pierce Brosnan is actually in this movie too and he sings horribly when (stutter) he comes up the scenes that he sings, just just (stutter) close your ears run away its its bad",0
Hello everyone,1
"Playing over my shoulder, unfortunately is this movie and this is Star Trek five: The Final Frontier, the two disc special collectors edition",0
(umm) This this (stutter) movie is is pretty obnoxious I have to say,0
(uhh) The fourth movie is is (stutter) known for being a very funny movie which I completely agree with,1
It is a very funny movie,0
This movie (uhh) tries to be funny,1
It tries very very hard to be funny and seems as effortful in its attempts at humor as the previous movie did (uhh) seem effortless (uhh) in in terms of being funny and this movie tries so hard to be funny and just fails at every twist and turn,1
"It is about (umm) a (uhh) a Vulcan who commandeers the Enterprise, cast and crew and all, and (uhh) tries to find God at the end of space and its (uhh) just as obnoxious as it sounds",1
It (uhh) was directed by William Shatner and he completely screws it up and it was the first movie he ever directed and they shouldnt have let him direct it because this is a franchise that I really enjoy,1
"The first one is kind of mediocre but the rest of em are all really good, with the exception of this one and (uhh) they followed up my beloved fourth one with this (uhh) steaming pile of garbage",0
(uhh) The special edition features for this (uhh) steaming pile of garbage (uhh) are as follows,1
"Theres a commentary with William Shatner and his daughter, who wrote a book about the process of making this movie",1
I cant wait to listen to it and listen to him try to defend himself,0
There is also a text commentary by the co-authors of the Star Trek encyclopedia,0
(uhh) Thats on disc one,0
Disc two has the Star Trek universe featurettes,0
(uhh) production featurettes about previsualization models and (uhh) press conference for Star Trek five,1
"Theres deleted scenes, although I cant imagine watching, wanting to watch any more of this movie outside of whats contained in the previous thing",0
"(uhh) Theres advertising, theatrical trailers and TV spots, which I enjoy watching",1
I really like watching TV spots and theres a production gallery,1
(umm) I dont like this movie,0
"I I got it in a in a set with all the other Star Trek movies and (uhh) I figured well you know, theyre so inexpensive, I mine as well get this one",0
Maybe its not as bad as I thought it was,0
Maybe its not as bad as I remember,0
But it is as bad as I remember its every inch as bad as I remember,0
"All right, ExpoTV, Im going to review Death Race",0
This is a outrageous movie that came out (uhh) in the middle of the August,0
Its been out for about a little over a month now,0
(umm) Its about a prisoner who gets framed and he goes to he goes to (stutter) a prison,1
Its in the future kind of too,1
And the economy is bad and people dont have good jobs,1
You find that out in the beginning of the movie,0
"And people dont have good jobs and stuff, so this guy gets framed and goes to jail",1
"And hes, like, a really good race car driver, apparently",0
"But thats not his job, its just in his history",0
"So he goes to jail and then (uhh) this (uhh) (uhh) lady who runs the jail asks him to do this TV show thats viewed by, like, everyone in the USA",1
"And so he, its like a death race",1
"Thats why the, you just drive around these cars with guns all over them and try and win the race",0
"And if you win all three races, then youre free and you dont have to serve your time anymore in jail",1
And its really hard to win,1
"And (umm) she just wants, she just wants him to race in it because (uhh) hes really good at racing",1
But youll find out more later in the movie,1
"But, anyway, so, yeah, its Death Race",1
(uhh) The actor is John Statham,1
"Thats why I saw it, because hes in it",1
Hes a really good actor,1
"Hes usually in action movies, like The Transporter and (uhh) a few other, like Crank, some other ones",0
(umm) Also is Joan Allen,0
Shes the lady who owns the prison and the TV show,1
"And then a bunch of others, like Tyrese Gibson, people like that",0
Hes another race car driver that (uhh) John Stathams character races against and tries to win,1
And so (stutter) this movie had a pretty good idea,0
"Like, I liked the storyline",0
"(umm) But it was just too much, like, action and too much, like there wasnt, it didnt really even out",0
"Like the acting and stuff, I dont know",1
"The story was pretty good, though, but the overall overall (stutter) movie wasnt that great, probably like three out of five stars",0
(uhh) Id recommend seeing it if you like any of the main characters in it,0
"But, other than that, its really nothing special",0
Youre not going to be blown away by it or anything,1
(uhh) You can pretty much guess whats going to happen (uhh) halfway through the movie,1
So its rated R for strong violence and language,1
"(umm) So definitely want to be, like, at least seventeen to go see it",0
Definitely not a kids movie,0
"(umm) Its about a hundred and five minutes long, so about hour and forty-five minutes",1
"Pretty good size movie, average",1
"(umm) So, yeah, Death Race",1
"(umm) Wouldnt recommend seeing it unless you really like the characters and you like action, violence, language movies, stuff like that",1
This is a movie,1
"Its a DVD, its called The Secret of Nikola Tesla, T-E-S-L-A, and (uhh) if you dont know who Nikola Tesla is, hes the guy back in the turn of the century he worked with George Westinghouse and (uhh) some other famous guys in developing the (uhh) actually Tesla came up with the idea for the AC motor and the AC generators and motors, some electrical stuff",1
And (umm) this movie is kind of a story about his life and Ill just read some of this,0
"This (stutters) his achievements, Nikola Tesla, lead to the discovery of the radio and television as well as the development of the first hydroelectric dam, remote control, radar tracking for the military, x-rays and manipulation of matter and energy",0
"So this guy was really smart guy back then and (uhh) and he made a large contribution towards, you know, the electronic age we have today",0
And (uhh) I was seeing documentaries on Nikola Teslas life and I much rather see the documentaries than this movie,0
"This movie (uhh) you know, is in the movie format",0
"So it kinda you know, its like his life from a child you know, to when hes grown up til hes dealing with all these electronic things and other powerful men like J",0
Morgan,1
"And (umm) this movie I would rate like you know, a two out of five",1
Its not a good movie because the just the movie was bad,0
"The you know there were some parts in there where, you know, hes talking to his friend in some foreign language and theres no subtitles so it goes on for two or three minutes you dont even know what hes saying",1
And the picture quality was really bad and just the story,1
If I didnt know you know the the (stutter) background of Nikola Tesla I would not (umm) I couldnt follow the movie too good,1
Hello,1
Id like to tell you about a movie that a friend took me to see and I didnt really like that much,0
"The movie is called Quarantine and the the (stutter) general plot is its kind of a, you know, a horror flick",1
"(uhh) People traveling are trapped in a hotel thats been quarantined for an unknown reason and theyre slowly getting, you know, picked off one at a time",1
"Now that plot may sound familiar, I know Ive seen it in a dozen other movies and frankly (uhh) none of them are that good",0
"Theres just not enough to work with there, I mean, sounds like a good place to build up some tension but they really didnt do a job in this movie",0
"It doesnt star anybody that Ive ever heard of and I just think it was done very, very poorly",0
"You know, you almost can tell anybody goes outside or comes up with a great idea or something that something bad is going to happen to them immediately, its pretty obvious, and when its obvious its not scary",0
Hi everybody today Im reviewing the (uhh) VHS copy of Star Trek: Insurrection,1
Starring the (uhh) the next generation it has (uhh) (uhh) all all (stutter) the characters which I cant remember the {Laughter} names,1
"But (uhh) its (uhh) really this is a negative review this is one that I am sad to say I really like star trek, I liked all the spinoffs, star trek, star trek the next generation",0
And a lot of the movies but Insurrection was a stinker,0
(uhh) It was horrible I cant recommend it,0
(uhh) This was given to me I would not have bought it,0
"(uhh) Its its (stutter) sad to say I mean you know I watched it out of curiosity just to see what was going on and and (stutter) (uhh) its just just (stutter) a really bad story, thats all there is to it",0
You know the effects are (uhh) these days theres just nothing that wows you,0
Its (uhh) nothing unusual but it is not always about effects its about the storyline and the storyline is just boring,0
So (uhh) I cant recommend this and I certainly wouldnt buy it,0
"Good morning, Im Anne Lezak, and Im chairman of the Rutland County Democrats.",1
"What do I value in a, or look for in a Presidential candidate?",1
"First of all, I would have to vote for a Presidential candidate who has Democratic values.",1
"I just cant see otherwise, because those are so near and dear to me.",1
"And, who espouses those, and is able to articulate them in a way that people can really relate to.",1
"Second of all, I really look for a candidate who I believe is ethical, and who lives his ethics, and doesnt, doesnt compromise.",1
Hello,1
I wanna tell you about a movie I just saw in theaters,1
Its called Punisher: War Zone,1
This is of course a movie based upon the popular Marvel character The Punisher,1
"Punisher AKA Frank Castle is played by Ray Stevenson and hes up against his classic nemesis, Jigsaw, played by Dominic West",1
This is actually not that great of a movie,0
I was kind of disappointed,0
Most of the Marvel movies have been pretty good in recent years and most of the comic book movies in general have been fairly well done,0
"This ones kind of weak, this is the third time theyve made a Punisher movie and second one in recent years",0
It seems its always getting a new cast and a new direction and its just not working for me,0
"The Punisher himself is kind of an avenging (uhh) angel, kind of in the grey area",0
"Is he a good guy or bad guy? He goes out and punches those who have done wrong, basically by hunting them down and killing them",0
And (uhh) just like in the comic books (uhh) when hes good hes really good,1
When hes (uhh) bad its unreadable,1
Well (uhh) when hes bad in the movies hes unwatchable,1
Its just a little too silly,0
Its a very very violent movie but the violence is kind of poorly done,0
"I mean, violence in and of itself is (uhh) okay, I reckon, if its done correctly",1
But this kind of weak (uhh) I mean its over the top violence,0
Its more ridiculous than it is (uhh) gritty and (uhh) I just didnt think they were able to pull this movie together,0
Hello,1
I want to talk to you about a movie I recently saw,1
Its called Twilight,0
"Actually, (uhh) this is not your typical review",0
Its almost a warning,1
Do not let your girlfriend drag you to see Twilight,1
This movie is aimed at young girls,1
And (uhh) for some reason some of the older girls seem like to like it as well,0
"But basically this is a movie for young, teenage girls and theres nothing there",0
Theres not much of a plot,1
"Its kind of run of the mill plot of a, a (stutter) young girl who gets sent away from her parents to back to, to her, her (stutter) father who, who lives in a different town",0
She goes to a new school and shes not fitting in,0
"She sees a dreamy young boy and oh yeah, he happens to be a vampire",1
"But hes not a bad vampire, hes a good vampire",0
He doesnt even drink people blood anymore,0
(uhh) except for some reason hes so infatuated with her he wants to drink her blood,0
"And shes so infatuated with him that (uhh) she might just let him, and thats basically the tension for the whole movie",0
(uhh) will he? Wont he? Will she let him? (ehh) whatever,0
"Drink blood, its just kind of stupid",1
"I guess its supposed to be some sort of romantic tension there and all the young girls in the audience went crazy for it, and I guess they thought the guy was dreamy or hot, or whatever they think nowadays",0
"But, to me, I just wanted to go to sleep",0
Its not a good movie,0
Theres nothing there,1
"And (uhh) frankly, vampires arent supposed to be this mushy romantic characters",0
"And if you really want to go that route, go watch Dark Shadows reruns somewhere on TV, they have to be out there somewhere",0
Theyre a lot better,1
"So, (uhh) see something else",1
See a real movie,0
"See a real man movie, something with explosions or something",0
"Hi, youre watching my video review of Role Models",1
This is a comedy thats rated R,1
Theres a lot of cursing and crudeness but unfortunately its not a funny movie,0
"The humor in the movie feels really forced, like theyre trying too hard and the writings not very good",0
"The movie is pretty formulaic, you know how the movies gonna end and I guess you could say that about a lot of movies in Hollywood but at least try to be funny along the way but this movie doesnt really deliver that",0
The character played by Sean William Scott is pretty annoying,0
"Sean William Scott is Stifler in every movie that hes in, and that mightve been funny back when he made American Pie like ten years ago or however long it was but, when you play the same character in every movie it starts to wear thin and just wasnt that funny",0
"So, I would recommend looking somewhere else and not watching Role Models",0
Hey expo,1
"Whats up? (umm) Today Im going to talk about a movie I saw called Valkyrie, starring Tom Cruise",1
(umm) Valkyrie was a bad movie,0
First of all Valkyrie is about a plot to assassinate Hitler before all hell breaks loose in Germany,0
Now most of us are pretty familiar with the history of World War Two but we know that Hitler killed himself so this is the first movie I ever went into knowing the ending,0
Now some people would say that thats important but it is when theyre trying to create suspense around it,0
Another thing that I didnt like about it was the fact that it starred Tom Cruise,1
"Not just cause hes a nutjob, but because he really did not convince me",0
"It wasnt a German soldier trying to overthrow Hitler, it was Tom Cruise pretending to be an (stutter), pretending to be a German soldier overthrowing Hitler and we saw through that",0
"He didnt even try, he didnt even attempt a German accent",0
"He can do an Irish accent in Far and Away, I dont understand why he couldnt do a German accent in this",0
"Also I went into this movie expecting at least a little bit of action considering the fact that it, its (stutter) surrounded by a war and, you know, violence",0
However there was none whatsoever,1
There was maybe three gunshots in the entire thing and I think they all missed,0
Maybe one hit,1
"And that was it, it was over",0
"They caught him, the end",0
Sorry if I ruined it for you but you really shouldnt be seeing it anyway,0
"So dont waste your time, go see something better",0
"I went to the movies (uhh) with the people that I work with, and we saw the movie The Unborn",1
I kind of wondered about this movie when I saw the previews,1
It was one of those ones that was gonna go one way or the other,0
It was either gonna be really good or it was gonna be really bad,0
"Unfortunately, it was really bad",0
It was one of the worst movies ever,0
The story line was completely stupid,0
It it (stutter) wasnt a good horror movie,0
It wasnt spooky,0
It wasnt scary,0
There was no part of the movie that made you jump,0
"There were no you know, got you minutes or anything like that",0
I mean it was just dumb,1
(umm) I didnt like the movie,1
I wouldnt recommend it,0
If I saw it on TV I would change the channel,0
"(umm) I would, I would (stutter) tell everybody not to waste their money going to see it",0
"If youre a die hard horror picture movie person, you probably still wont like it",0
"But if you still want to see it, wait for it to come on DVD",0
Dont waste your money in the theater,0
"Hi, today Im reviewing the movie Gran Torino, starring Clint Eastwood and directed by Clint Eastwood",1
"(umm) The movie is about a Korean war veteran, played by Eastwood, who lives in (umm) a Detroit suburb suburb (stutter) and (umm) is trying to cope with the changing of his neighborhood as several (uhh) Hmong (uhh) immigrants start to relocate into the town",1
(umm) He is a very crotchety old man and he starts the film at his wifes funeral with his disrespectful family who hes pretty much always disappointed with,1
(umm) And he slowly comes to terms with the changing neighborhood around him and befriends the (umm) Hmong neighbors next door,1
"(umm) Overall, this movie was not as great as Id expected from (umm) Eastwood",0
Both in the directors chair and as an actor,1
(umm) I was kinda disappointed with it,1
I thought the dialogue was silly at times and it was (umm) very melodramatic film,0
(umm) Which was unfortunate cause I really wanted to go in to watch a great Eastwood film,1
"(umm) As an actor he plays jut kind of a crotchety old man, but he does turn into (umm) the (uhh) kind of the Clint Eastwood we all know and love",0
"The (uhh) gun toting, dont take anything from anybody Clint Eastwood who (umm) just kind of uses violence to get his way",0
(umm) And he deals with the repercussions of that and (uhh) his own personal feeling toward the immigrants in his town,1
(umm) The character development was okay,1
(umm) I really enjoyed seeing Clint Eastwood as this character,0
"He was funny and very (uhh) gruff and (umm) hard to love, which makes him likable",0
"But overall, I really I was very disappointed with the film",1
(umm) Eastwood was great in the movie,1
"(umm) But it was kind of a one dimensional character, even though he does kind of go through character transition that you would expect him to go through",1
(umm) And it is kind of (umm) typical kind of (umm) an ending that you would see coming if you were paying attention to the movie and (umm) kinda predictable,0
But I did like his performance,1
"I would, overall I would have to give the movie only two out of five stars",0
"(umm) Like I said, I was disappointed with it overall",0
But (umm) Its well worth it just to see Clint Eastwood turning into an old man and using a gun to get those darn kids off his lawn,0
"(umm) So if you are fan of Eastwood maybe check it out just to see him in what could be his last (uhh) acting role, or starring acting role anyway",1
Hey everyone on ExpoTV dot com,1
Now today Im going to be reviewing a movie in theaters called Fired Up,1
Now I forget who this is starring but Ill give you a little summary of what the movies about,1
"Its about these two guys who are tired of summer football camps and decide to scheme and go to a cheerleading camp and obviously theyre surrounded by all these young women and this guy, like they start falling for them and a bunch of stuff happens",0
Now overall it wasnt really that funny,0
There was nothing really funny about it,1
They tried to use like sexual humor to get you to laugh but it didnt work,0
"(umm) It had a lot, here lets see, its actually Im not even gonna see",0
But (uhh) its just overall another one of these stupid movies,0
"(uhh) its nothing special, nothing worth seeing",0
"The plot is basically like I said, the summary sums it up, so if that sounds interesting go watch it, I dont know",1
"But obviously, I mean honestly I think that it was a terrible movie",0
"It just left me, I left the theaters just completely yawning and bored and I dont know why I just spent my money so please do not waste your money watching this movie",0
"Hey yall, hows it going? My name is Jordan and (uhh) today Im going to be reviewing the DVD Spy Game",1
"Now this had Brad Pitt in it, the movie itself had Brad Pitt in it, and Robert Redford and (umm) when I watched this movie I thought it was boring",0
"(umm) I, when I went into it I was thinking it was going to be, you know, this big action movie",0
"I mean on the front it has this explosion and, you know, it has all this helicopter and the men moving and everything",1
But really its not that action packed at all,1
"Its (uhh) more of a drama kind of movie, and I didnt really get into it at all because I was expecting it to be this huge elaborate, you know, action movie where, you know, stuff blew up and people were shooting and stuff like that, but that that (stutter) wasnt this at all",0
(umm) It was really more of a psychological drama kind of movie,0
It really didnt have that much action,1
"So (umm) I dont think Id really recommend this movie, its not really that great",0
So the movies not that good so I guess yall should probably stay away from it,1
"(umm) Special features wise theres a good bit of special features but I just didnt care to see them because I didnt like the movie, so I didnt really care about the special features also, but (umm) in the in the (stutter) special features they have (uhh) a documentary on how they created some of the (uhh) some of the limited action scenes that they did",0
"You know, theres only a few, but the ones that they did they explained them",0
But (umm) other than that I think theres a commentary and theatrical trailer but thats about it,1
"So (umm) really I wouldnt recommend this one, I dont, I dont think this was a really good movie so its really not worth purchasing",0
If you must see it though definitely go rent it first,0
But (umm) but yeah that thats (stutter) about it,0
"Hi Expo, today I wanna do a movie review for you of a movie currently in theaters and that is Confessions of a Shopaholic",1
And I have my ticket stub here for Confessions of a Shopaholic,1
Confessions of a Shopaholic is (umm) based on a series of novels (stutter) by Sophie Consella,0
(umm) And it is about a girl named Becky Bloomwood who is obsessed with shopping,0
This particular film (umm) Ive read the novels and theyre really good I guess you could say chick lit,0
"(umm) Very fluffy, very entertaining, but this movie was absolutely awful",1
"(umm) Which, I think you can kind of tell from the previews its gonna be not so funny",1
"(umm) In the novels Becky Bloomwood is, you know, I think that her character is a little bit smarter but in this movie she comes off as very dumb",1
And the message at the end of the movie isnt very good,0
(umm) I dont think,0
And its just over the top and the character of Becky is just not very strong and the acting I also thought was not very good (umm) (umm) for that character,0
"I would definitely recommend that if youve read the shopaholic books to absolutely not go see this movie, and if you havent read the shopaholic books too absolutely not go see this movie cuz its its its (stutter) really awful",0
"I (umm) it doesnt have a good message, no good characters, the characters are portrayed as dumb (umm) and over the top, so dont go see it",1
"Hi everyone, today Im doing my (stutter) review on this movie called The International",1
(umm) Clive Owens is in it and to be honest with you I dont remember it very much,1
I watched it about a week ago in theaters and it was so boring,0
"Its supposed to be kind of this like thriller drama, but half the time I didnt know what was going on",0
(umm) He basically is a detective or works for the law and is looking for this person and these people that are in charge of a bank that (umm) supposedly trying to kill people and murder people and get away with it,0
(umm) Thats the main plot line,1
But he his (stutter) character didnt seem very strong,0
The supporting characters didnt seem very strong,0
The story line was kind of boring,1
So I would not recommend this to anybody to go in theaters and watch,0
I probably wouldnt (stutter) recommend it renting it either when it comes out on DVD,0
"Hey, everyone on ExpoTV dot com",1
"Now, today Im going to be reviewing another movies in theaters called The Haunting in Connecticut",1
"Now (umm) this is sort of, if youve ever seen the movie Poltergeist, then (uhh) this movie is pretty similar to that",0
"Its basically this kid is being treated for cancer, so they relocate their house",0
And the house that (uhh) they move into has a dark history behind it basically,0
"And, you know, all this weird stuff goes on",0
"And then they basically try to get help from a ghost hunter to drive, like, the evil spirits out of their house",1
"(umm) Anyway, I didnt really find this movie (uhh) that good",0
"It had some creepy moments, but I was expecting a lot more from the trailer",0
You see a lot more and it kind of freaks you out and wants you to go see it,0
"But, you know, nothing really special",1
I didnt really catch onto anything,0
"It was a pretty plain movie anyway {yawn} but, you know, maybe maybe (stutter) (uhh) there will be other ones that come out",0
"But this is not a good horror movie, I dont think, at least",0
I might be wrong,1
"You can go check at, check it out and maybe prove me wrong",0
I dont really know,1
I cant really think of anything that was that good about it,0
It was okay,0
"I mean, it was entertaining to watch, but nothing really had you thinking it really, nothing special",1
Hey there expo,1
So regrettably yesterday I went to go see Next Day Air,0
"(umm) One of my poorer choices, to say the least",1
"(umm) But it was a rainy afternoon, didnt really anything to do so headed out for a matinee",0
"Figured, you know, lower price, cant lose too bad, right? (umm) Well I went to go see Next Day Air cause (umm) Id already seen Star Trek and I heard awful things about Wolverine",0
So (umm) yeah,0
This was (stutter) supposed to be a comedy,0
(uhh) It wasnt that funny,0
"I mean there was some funny parts, (umm) Ill Ill (stutter) give it that",1
"But overall it wasnt fun to watch, (stutter) the acting was subpar to say the least",1
(umm) It did have (uhh) Turk from Scrubs fame (umm) and Avon Barksdale from The Wire so some actors that I was familiar with,0
"(umm) But they did not really deliver the package, so to speak, (umm) in this, in this (stutter) film",1
"Brief synopsis (umm) a cocaine shipment from Mexico gets delivered to the wrong apartment in Philadelphia and chaos and hilarity ensue, or at least theyre supposed to",0
(uhh) Chaos definitely happened,1
Hilarious (uhh) not so much,0
It had its funny moments but overall I would definitely not watch it again and if I had the choice I would go back and not see it,1
"(uhh) So thats, yeah Next Day Air",1
Its in theaters now,0
"Hey, how you doing? My name is Roger",1
Went and saw Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince (umm) the other night,0
And I will tell you I am not (umm) one of those Harry Potter fans,0
Have not read the books,0
"(uhh) Have seen the other movies, but Ive seen the movies because I went with my daughters, or (umm) who who (stutter) were had gotten into the books, and read the books and really (umm) you know, were a fan of Harry Potter",1
(umm) So (umm) my my (stutter) review is based off of someone who is not a true Harry Potter fanatic,0
"Okay, but went to go see a movie with a daughter that enjoyed it (umm) that it was a fanatic",1
"But, so I want to give you my perspective from the other side of it",0
(umm) I did not read the books,0
"(umm) I have seen all the movies, I did state that",1
"(umm) What I found with this movie, one it was two hours and thirty minutes long, which was a tad bit long for me",0
"(umm) Because most of the, most of the (stutter) time in the first thirty minutes, I was trying to figure out who these people were",1
"How they related to each other, and they did talk about things that happened in prior movies, and I vaguely remember",0
"And if I had read the book, obviously I would know the whole story up to this point in time",0
"Because what Im, whatever number this movie is, it is a, it is the next segment in the (umm) in the series of of (stutter) movies",1
"So I did understand that you, you cant just walk in and say, and expect to catch up with everything",1
It doesnt start from the beginning,1
"Its, picks up pretty much, I guess where it left off of the other one",0
"So this (uhh) (uhh) was a (uhh) little bit of a hindrance for me, because like you said for thirty minutes I was trying to remember who was that person",0
"How did they relate? Who was that for? Were they a good guy or a bad guy? (umm) They looked familiar, those type of things",1
"So I had a little bit, you know, trouble catching up with that",1
"The movie itself was fun, it was enjoyable",0
It was action packed,1
It moved along very well,1
"(umm) Again, it was just the thinking behind it, the story behind it, I didnt carry it as well as I needed to",0
So maybe I should have watched the other Harry Potter movies before I went,0
"(umm) I definitely, if you ever get into it",0
"Read the book, cause the book will definitely tell you what you need to know",1
I just however was not going to read that book before I watched the movie,1
"So you know, it was enjoy, more enjoyable for my family whove read the books",0
"(umm) It was not, wasnt (stutter) quite as enjoyable for me",1
"So, its just okay",1
"(umm) I probably would not go see it again because, again, I I (stutter) until I have some background information, it just really wouldnt work for me that way",0
"Okay, that was Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince",1
"Hi there, Im Alexis and Im doing a review on My Sisters Keeper",1
This movie is playing out in theaters and it is very good,1
I would give it a five star rating,1
And (umm) basically the movie is PG-thirteen its one hour and forty-six minutes,1
(umm) There are very good actresses and actors in this movie,1
And I was very impressed with the film,1
"(uhh) Theres Abigail Breslin, Cameron Diaz, Sofia Vassilieva and Jason Patrick",1
"And they all play very, very good",1
(umm) I was just really impressed with this movie and I recommend it to many people,1
One thing that I should warn you about is the movie will probably make you cry throughout the whole film,0
"Because its about this little girl who is dying from leukemia and there are just (umm) the family, it (umm) is just getting torn apart",1
"And theres just a lot of the drama going on and (umm) its a wonderful storyline, really really interesting and (umm) it will just keep you on the edge of your seat the whole movie",1
"Its very, very good and I am so impressed with how it turned out",1
"Theres also a bestselling book called My Sisters Keeper and thats why they have the movie and (umm) its just so good, so",1
"Go watch it, I mean I just want everyone to see it because its just so serious you can see how (umm) you can watch a girl, a little kid going through leukemia and its just so sad but",1
"I mean, it just shows you right there and",1
"I mean that stuff really gets to you and it was pretty serious, so (umm) I think that many people should see it so that you can see how serious leukemia is and how much it affects the family",1
"And all that, so yeah",1
"It just, it opened my eyes to life and like opened my eyes to a different view on life and I know that it would open many views to other peoples and people",1

"No problem, Ill be able to answer that for you.",1
My name is Rebecca Wilson and Im the Chief Curator at Saatchi Art and the Director of our Art Advisory service.,1
"Im really excited to be able to introduce you to our Invest in Art series, a series that we put together to give people help and guidance about investing in emerging art.",1
"When people ask me for my advice about which works they should buy and how they should go about investing in emerging art, Im always reminded of the wonderful story of Herbert and Dorothy Vogel, an American couple who lived in a small apartment in New York and didnt have much money but shared a passion for art.",1
"In the 1960s, they started buying works by emerging artists, artists who werent known but actually went on to become some of the giants of the modern art scene.",1
"Names such as Donald Judd, Roy Lichtenstein, and Chuck Close.",1
"Over 30 years, they amassed an extraordinary collection of over 4,000 works, which they donated in the 1990s to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.",0
"This fantastic story reminds us that you dont actually have to have big budgets in order to start a collection, and buying works by emerging artists is a great way to begin.",1
So I hope you will look at the works that Ive selected by emerging artists for our ongoing Invest in Art series.,1

We do it very well,1
I had one student tell me that he came in-- he came in to see me in office hours,1
"And he said to me, you know, it took me three weeks to figure out what you wanted from me",1
That went quite well.,1
I organized it.,0
I did all the land selections.,1
We were entitled a hundred and thirty thousand acres.,1
Being in a area where there is quite a bit of activity.,0
"And military state, other private individuals claiming land where we had...we had the right to invade up to 50 percent of state selections.",1
Of course that was half a hundred...three townships.,1
So that wasnt too difficult.,1

"Find one that’s in your city or that’s easy to travel to, and make sure you watch this short video before you go",1
What live events have you attended,1

What is a motivational speaker?,1
"And I think, I think in my case a motivational speaker is someone who sort of combines giving knowledge to the people that Im speaking to.",0
I definitely would say mobile is the up and coming sort of thing.,1
Insights are critical.,1

Hi my name is Pat Goodwin with patgoodwinassociates.com and today we are going to talk about how to write summaries for resumes.,1
The summary is a direct reflection of what you have done in the work itself but also who you are as a person.,1
"I have said so many times that people want to know what youve done, when youve done it and where but when they meet you they want to know how you think and the summary is a perfect opportunity to demonstrate that.",1
Of course there are some basic principles that you would do in following a resume with a summary.,1
"You would have your name at the top, centered, all caps in bold about ten or eleven point then you would have your contact information.",1
Hopefully you would have an e-mail that is not a strange looking e-mail.,1
Todays question comes from Linda in Florida and its on Personal Branding.,1
I posted on Facebook a while back and said if you have any questions on marketing your businesses as a speaker ask away and her question was what if I have to develop 3 separate brand identities?,0
And while its not impossible but its not advised you know too many speakers today are getting in the business because theyve seen speakers from yesteryear and what they do and what theyre doing is theyre looking at them and modeling their business models.,1
Theres a problem with that.,0
the most famous speakers of today are using a business model thats about forty years old and while it works great for them when theyre already an established brand the new speakers of tomorrow dont have the luxury to be like generalists and solve everybodys problems all the time.,1
"Well, with mobile, location becomes so much more important.",0

Ive lost track of the number of hours Ive spent writing and rewriting the same speech.,0
"If it werent for the seemingly infinite number of documents I can create in Microsoft Word, my indecisiveness probably would have killed at least one trees worth of paper.",0

Secrets to a successful visitor visa application.,1
A lot of people who are applying for a Canadian visitor visa are nervous whether or not they will succeed.,1
Will they get a visa?,1
Will they get refused?,1
"After all, applying for a visitor visa can be nerve wrecking.",1
"Hello everyone, my name is Hishge Bessey of visaplace.com.",0
"When an immigration officer is processing visa application, all of them actually have one big question in their mind, Will this applicant go back to their home country after theyve finished their visit to Canada? This will be our main concern especially if the applicant is from a developing or underdeveloped countries because many of the visitors from those countries dont go back.",1
So how do you convince the officer that you are a true visitor who will play by the rules?,1
There are several factors that may help you to succeed.,1
The first factor will be to show you have a strong establishment in your country.,1
"This includes your employment stability, any school attendance if thats applicable to you, and assets you own, and marital status, children and family, and any other responsibilities that require your return to your home country.",1
"Payday loans have become a scourge across Britain attacking our high streets and giving people the idea that this very niche form of lending, thats unsuitable for most people   is perfectly normal.",0
Worse still we see it even on our childrens television channels.,1
"Its a form of  financial grooming in luring the next generation to this type of debt, making them think its normal, its perfectly normal to borrow at extremely high rates for short terms with terrible terms if you cant repay.",0
"Thats why what youre doing, in encouraging credit unions, nonprofit local organizations still with the same protection &amp; backing from the regulator the Financial Services Compensation Scheme protection just as legitimate.",1
"Encouraging them take on the payday lenders to show that if you really need money (cos if you dont need it, why are you borrowing it?) If you really need money, then there is another alternative.",1
and what we have to do in every way that we possibly can is think about getting that message out to a wider society so I love the idea of the contest.,1
How do you promote credit unions?,1
What does it mean to you?,1
Do you know whether your business is required to have a corporate seal and official stock certificates? These items were once required items for corporations,1
"Now, even though they are no longer required, they can still be extremely useful",1
Most states still recognize the legal power of a corporate seal and official stock certificates,1
"The corporate seal, like a state seal, was once the official mark of a corporation",1
"Corporate Seals are official identifying marks that are imprinted into clay, wax, metal or paper",1
"Today’s more modern Corporate Seals emboss the corporation’s official name, state and year of its formation onto legal documents which represent the power and authority to authenticate them",1
"As a corporation is considered a separate entity, its own person, and the seal acted as its signature",1
"This was because an individual could not authorize certain corporate acts, and the corporate seal proved corporate authority",1
"In the digital age, though, technology has made the corporate seal obsolete",1
"You might sometimes still see a corporate seal used for deeds or bank accounts, but even these are rare",1
"Today, state laws recognize the signature of an individual with corporate authority, such as the CEO or director, as binding upon the corporation",1
"Originally, official stock certificates served as title to a corporation’s stock and were issued to all stock holders",1
These certificates showed proof of ownership of corporate shares,1
One of the key trends that we are continuing to see as important and where were directing some of our money is in just the general online marketing area.,1
When the game was first designed there was another mechanic which is no longer used.,1
"For an interesting reason, theres a zone called the anti zone which is where your cards go when you risk them, when you risk the ownership of them on a game.",1
The rules for anti had to be discontinued and disallowed because it turned out that they were against the law according to the gambling statutes.,0
For Magic to remain legal the anti cards had to be removed from the game.,1
"Do you own a restaurant, B&amp;B, hair salon, or any other LOCAL business?",1
Then you need to start collecting reviews!,1
A recent survey shows that 88% of consumers read online reviews to determine the quality of a local business.,1
"When you also factor in the popularity of online directories like Yelp, you will quickly realize how important it is to start collecting online reviews.",1
But how can you generate reviews and increase positive feedback about your business without making your clients feel uncomfortable or pushed into a corner?,1
Here are three steps to get you started.,1
The first and most obvious one is: Provide excellent service.,1
"Easier said than done and yet, too often forgotten.",1
"While most clients will not take the time to write a review about a mediocre experience, they WILL share details of an extremely bad experience, or an outstanding one.",1
Try to provide one of those outstanding experiences that will motivate your clients to write a review.,1
The second step is to create a personalized profile for your business on major online directories and social networks.,1
Make sure to claim ownership on all of your business’s listings and let your customers know to check them out.,1
"Once you’ve created your profiles, you are ready for Step #3. Make it easy for your clients to leave you feedback.",1
"To do this, create links from your website to your listings’ sites.",1
You can also put up signs in your business or on your menu.,1
Just a recap Show an example where you demonstrated this strength,1
"Although there is no universal, one-size-fits-all answer for this question, you’ll feel more confident if you can create a structured response",1
The best way to prepare is to list a few strengths that correspond to the job you want,1
"Then, imagine a story that illustrates how you demonstrated that strength in the past",1
"And most importantly, keep your sentences simple",1
to help us create more out of classroom conversations for that and engage in community dialogue,1
"because what I know for sure If anybody can help heal the community, it would be a community college",1
We are a place where all of these things have happened before,1
"Every time someone new has come into our community, weve been there to help respond",1
Anytime is been an economic struggle in our community come we have been part responsive,1
Anybody is gonna do it is gonna be us,1
"But we have to have courage, we have to have civility, and we have to be willing to be vulnerable on this so realize that we are different perspectives and create space for all that to happen",1
"Hi, this is Michael Niren, immigration lawyer and founder of VisaPlace.com.",0
"The Cake Boss, Buddy Valastro, has allegedly been charged with a DUI.",1
"Now why this is interesting from an immigration perspective, is that if hes in fact convicted, he may be prevented from entering Canada.",0
"Not to say that he wants to come to Canada, but if he ever does, he would have a criminal record, and the Canadian authorities, the border authorities, the CBSA theyre called, Canadian Border Service Agency, officers could potentially deny him from entering Canada, and he may have to apply for a special permit called the temporary resident permit, or TRP, to be admitted.",0
"So the consequences of being convicted of an offense are not just that you would have a criminal record in your own country, but if you want to cross borders and come to Canada, you may be prevented from doing so.",1
Hi,1
My Roger and I want to tell you about a movie called Body Double,1
"Now this is a Brian De Palma movie that came out back in nineteen eighty four and I will tell you back in the eighties when I first saw this movie, I thought it was a pretty good movie",1
"(umm) It had it as a mystery, intrigue, (umm) you know, very, very, kind of (uhh) (stutter) drama type (uhh) you know investigative type movie and (umm) you know and back then I really enjoyed it",1
I thought it was a good movie about a guy who was house sitting and actually seeing somebody get murdered and all of the sudden shes there,1
So they try to figure out how this happened,1
"(umm) But you know, getting this movie a couple years ago because I saw it on the shelf and looked at it and I said, you know, its kind of, its its (stutter) just not up to par with todays type of movies",1
"(umm) Theres a little bit hocky (umm) looking at it now the special effects were were (stutter) terrible, I mean they werent that good at all and the story wasnt as deep as I thought it originally was",1
"So, you know, Ill take it, if you, if you (stutter) want to go back down through memory lane to see movies that were done back in the eighties, this is obviously an eighties type movie",0
"(umm) Its not up to par with anything on todays standards and Ill tell you, I saw it again and I just I just (stutter) didnt enjoy it like I would of some of movies that, you know, that some of the other older movies so, but anyways its called Body Double, its rated R because its got some sexual scenes in it and some cussing in it things like this language (umm) and and (stutter) some nudity, you know and, and back in the eighties, I guess, you know when you look at the, the (stutter) (uhh) {laughter} the selection you had, this was a pretty good movie but in todays todays (stutter) standards, todays world, it really was a kinda a hocky eighties movie so I dont really recommend you go and get it or go and watch it again, theres probably some other movies that you probably rather watch instead of that",0
"But anyways, its called Body Double and (umm) its got its a Brian De Palma movie",1
Ok,0
Hi,1
My names Jennifer and today Im going to talk to you about How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days,1
Now this movie stars Kate Hudson and Mathew McConaughey and it is made by Paramount Pictures,1
It is an absolutely brilliant movie,1
This is my favorite romantic comedy of all time,1
"I love Kate Hudson, Mathew McConaughey together",1
"Theres sparks flying in this movie, theyre just so good together",1
(umm) You can really see the interaction between them,1
And basically Kate works for a magazine and she writes a column how to something in ten days,1
So what she chose to do was how to lose a guy in ten days and Mathew McConaughey wants to get a contract (umm) for the diamond market and to do so he has to make a woman fall in love with him in ten days,1
So the two just happen to meet and (umm) theyre paired up together and shes trying to drive him away and hes trying to woo her over,1
So its just a battle of who can win,1
Can she lose him or can he make her fall in love with him? Its just very funny the way Kate Hudson just dominates (umm) being the woman of the relationship,1
At first shes just so great and then she does everything she knows guys hate,1
"Its so great, cause everyone knows the classic cliches",1
(umm) Calling twenty times a day or talking baby talk or just putting stuffed animals all over his apartment,1
"Things like that, and shes so great",1
Im going to be reviewing the movie Hamburger Hill,1
"This movies about a (uhh) unit of American soldiers during the Vietnam war who have to defend this actually, no they have to attack this hill and (uhh) try to remove the (uhh) North Vietnamese from there",1
"Its (uhh) its a pretty sad movie, since (uhh) some people who you werent expecting to die do in fact die",0
The (uhh) only thing about this movie is theres (uhh) some better Vietnam movies out there and with better casts,0
"This cast is (uhh) the most notable person on here is probably Don Cheadle or that guy from practice, I dont remember his name",0
Hey guys Peter Leeds here.,1
People have been asking me what tactics I use when trading stocks so ill give them to you now but keep in mind this is not trading advice its just simply what I do and if you wanna learn more swing over to the blog at peterleeds.com we have more details there.,1
"I cut my loses early, I let my gains run.",1
"I always observe position sizing, I dont average down but I average up.",0
Its also very important what I try to observe is that you make your money when you buy the stock not when you sell the stock.,1
Its so much more important to get it at a good buy price than it is to get a good sell price.,1
I completely ignore previous prices.,1
Many investors will look at a stock and say its down half of the value it used to be at or its at a fraction of the value and they wrongly believe that that means thats a good investment or its cheap.,1
"The way it works is that the shares are gonna act the way they are gonna act based on the things hat happen in the future not what happened in the past, a stock has no memory.",0
So this is a movie review on Inception starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt,1
(umm) I wasnt very excited going in to see this movie,0
(umm) It was my friends choice to go see this movie,1
I hadnt even seen the previews for it,1
But I wasnt going to complain,1
"And I just, Im very glad that this is what my friends chose to see",1
It was such an amazing movie,1
"My mind was like completely blown with the, with the movie, with the twists, with everything",1
"(umm) Im not really the biggest Leonardo DiCaprio fan but he did an amazing job and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is just an extremely (uhh) flexible actor, hes very versatile, he can play a lot of different roles",1
"(umm) Seeing him in Five Hundred Days of Summer didnt make me believe that he was going to do a good job on such serious role as this one, but I was definitely proven wrong",1
"(umm) The ending, oh the ending is just, its crazy",1
It leaves you on the edge of your seat and kind of angers you too,1
"This movie gets you so, it makes you think, you know",1
(umm) Inception (umm) is explained in the movie to be going into somebodys dream and planting an idea in their mind that grows with them,1
And it just like changes who they are and how they feel about life and things,1
"(umm) Like I said, it was an amazing movie, (uhh) definitely a five out of five",1
Actually it was more like a ten out of five,1
"It was so good that its, its (stutter) a movie you have to see",1
"organizations like our voice, and basically just informing Greek gentleman of making good decisions with the influence of alcohol and making sure that we clearly define consent and that we basically hold each other accountable and dont make bad decisions",1
So our campus culture revolves a lot around education,0
"If you walk through our, our student union━you walk through the quad, anything",0
Hey guys,1
Im going to do the movie called Norbit,0
(umm) I had a chance to huh catch this movie on a prerelease screening (umm) last week,1
Thank goodness I did not pay for the movie,0
It (uhh) stars Eddie Murphy,0
He plays several characters in the movie,0
"(umm) He plays the main character and he plays (umm) a big a big obese woman in the character as well and you know, its about him trying to win his true love, trying to impress this woman",0
Which is not that obese (stutter) obese woman in the movie that he also plays but thats another another actress who portrays his true love in the movie,1
"I mean after watching (umm) The nutty Professor or Doctor Dolittle (umm) those (stutter) movie were tolerable, but this movie was was (stutter) just out of the park",0
"When I was watching this movie throughout throughout (stutter) in a in a (stutter) movie in the theater, I was just going what the heck am I doing here? (umm) I mean, the only thing I was impressed with the movie movie (stutter) was (umm) the fact that he he (stutter) played several different characters (umm) at the same time in the movie",1
(uhh) That was the only thing that I was (uhh) (uhh) you know impressed with,1
"Other than that the acting was (uhh) really really less than mediocre and the story line is so cliche and you know, so over done",1
I mean what happened to Eddie Murphys (umm) career? I mean this is how low hes gonna go? How low can he sink any further? I hope he will get better roles (umm) than this movie,0
"(umm) This movie I mean, if you dont have to pay for the the (stutter) movie ticket for this (uhh) Norbit, I recommend it",0
"(umm) If not, dont catch it at all",0
This is a review for the movie AntiTrust,1
"(umm) The main actors in it are Ryan Phillippe, Rachael Leigh Cook, Claire Foriani, Forlani and Tim Robbins",0
"(umm) If I was a professional reviewer and I had to give this movie (uhh) you know a star rating, it would probably be like two out of five",1
"(uhh) That being said its still sort of a fun, (uhh) enjoyable movie to watch if youre not terribly concerned with, you know, genius level filmmaking",0
"(umm) Its just, (uhh) sort of a fun movie",0
"It kind of takes place where the main characters sort of, invited to work for (uhh) a Microsoft-like company, and (uhh) things are all sort of going on (uhh) in the company and he discovers it all, and its sort of like, what happens from there",1
"(umm) You know (stutter) its a, its a (stutter) solid movie",1
"Its rated PG thirteen, (uhh) so pretty much anyone can watch it",1
"(umm) Its only about, just slightly under two hours long",1
I think about an hour and forty-eight minutes,1
"(uhh) But, you know, its a solid movie thats sort of fun",1
I wouldnt try to impress anyone with it,1
"&gt;&gt; Hi, good evening, this is Ambuj Chaturvedi.",1
"To answer the question whether India can become a superpower or not, the obvious answer is yes, because eventually we will arrive at that spot.",1
"We -- the transformation process is starting, has begun since 91, so India is not looking back.",0
Now the second part of the question would be what does it take to be a superpower and when can become a superpower?,1
So what is the definition of a superpower?,1
"Nuclear weapons, good roads, good railways, good infrastructure, good power, good power facilities, zero power cuts, womens education, equal rights.",1
"India will arrive at all those -- India will arrive at all those avenues, all those milestones will be achieved.",1
"As many times only a small amount of people actually possesses this knowledge, sharing it will hold a large advantage for your company",1
"This will result in greater cooperation among your employees, a better working environment and reduce time to complete tasks and activities",1
And are there any more advantages,1
"Yes, Victor, there are many",1
Knowledge markets will allow you to resolve problems by using the knowledge of your staff,1
Furthermore you will depend less on external sources of knowledge,1
Also employees will realize that they are working or looking for information on the same topics,1
"This may lead to the creation communities, which is a great tool for the facilitation of exchange of knowledge within groups",1
"You convinced me Paula, but how can I organize such a knowledge market",1
The movie I will be reviewing for you right now is Final Cut starring Robin Williams,1
The idea of this film is very very interesting,1
"The whole main tag of this is basically in the end, he sees everything",1
"See, in the near future, they have people that run a machine called the guillotine",1
"What it does is that after you die, it takes all of your memories that were downloaded on a chip that was implanted in your brain",1
And what it does is it allows them to make little snippets for your funeral,0
Little (uhh) home movies if you will,1
Just a reel of movies to show at your funeral,0
"Now, this man sees atrocities",1
"All sources of evil off people throughout his adventures of, well not really adventures but throughout his career of going through everyones memories and editing them for their familys consumption at the funeral",1
"Now as I said, thats a very good premise",1
That probably have you captured right now like I wanna see Final Cut right now,1
"It is a good idea, its executed well to a point",1
I mean it takes Robin Williams and shows how hes going slowly descend into this abyss of the things Ive seen and it just ropes him into a conspiracy,0
Hes seen the memories of the wrong person and how now people are after him for what he knows,1
"But just the way they ended the movie was so terrible that, {sigh} its not even worth seeing the whole thing because it just, it just lifts you up to a point where youre just like, this is great",1
This is the kind of movie that makes you think about how things could end up,0
How people would be in the future,1
What people would do after they die and kinda live forever you know,1
Like they have their memories on their chip and now people would just be like well this is what he was like and this is what he did,1
"But unfortunately, the ending of this movie is too horrible and too disappointing to say this is a good movie",1
"Hello, Im here to tell you about this crazy movie Sasquatch Mountain",0
This was just released recently,1
It was made for Sci-Fi,0
(uhh) This movie pretty much reeked,1
(uhh) It has the typical Sci-Fi story line where theyre out in the woods and theres monsters killing them one by one and you know,0
The typical Sci-Fi channel movie,0
(umm) This movie was just pretty corny,0
"The graphics are bad and everything, the acting",0
I think theres maybe one or two good actors in this movie that are in some other popular movies,0
But this movie really stunk and its not really that entertaining,1
"I dont really recommend you watch it, but if you wanna make fun of it then Id watch it",0
"This is a review of the most recent movie that Ive seen, and (umm) it was Harry Potter and I saw it on, well, I saw the midnight premiere, so it was Friday the twenty-third of July",1
June,1
June,1
And (umm) so this is my ticket,1
Harry Potter,1
"It says Friday the twenty-second because I saw the type of thing where you see the first part of (umm) Harry Potter seven, and then right after you see the (stutter) second part",1
"So the first part started at eight forty, and (umm) I really liked that because it",1
(umm) Lets you refresh the memory (umm) of what happened in the first part of the movie,1
But I dont think theyre having that any more,1
But I really do I really did like the movie,1
"They did a really, really great special effects",1
"(umm) I loved the fight scenes, usually Im not a huge fight scene fan in movies, but it was really great and had you sitting on the edge of your seat, so I really did like that",1
"(umm) The special effects was great, everything looked so realistic",1
"The acting was great, they really come into their characters",1
"(umm) And I really my favorite part of the movie is at the end, when it has the (umm) shot into the future of what Harry, Ron and Hermione are going to be like in the future",1
"Really, really loved that part",1
So I really recommend this movie,1
"Hello, Ime here today to talk about Conan The Barbarian",1
This is the latest Conan The Barbarian,1
"(uhh) Little background, I am a fan of the original Conan The Barbarian movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger (uhh) But Im more of a fan of the comic book Conan",1
Thats why I went to see this movie,1
(umm) I kinda knew that it wasnt gonna be the greatest movie in the world when I went to see it because the reviews werent that great and its not really doing that great at the box office,0
"But I have heard that its closer to the comic book in the way that it was originally intended to be when it was written, and by that I mean its a lot more animistic",1
A lot more goriness and a lot more hacking and slashing than your typical sword and sorcery movie,1
(uhh) But where this fell short was on (uhh) several points,0
"(uhh) First of all, the acting wasnt that great",1
"Well (uhh) I guess the acting was okay, but the dialogue they were given was not really anything that someone could work with",1
I thought Jason Momoa did as good as could be expected and I thought its actually a fairly convincing Conan in looks and actions,1
"And the supporting cast was all big names, but none of em had any roles",1
"(uhh) You know, Rose McGowan, Rachel Nichols (uhh) Ron Pearlman, they all had little small parts and (uhh) even the ones that had bigger parts, like Rachel Nichols, didnt really add anything to the movie",1
(umm) Basically what we get is tons of hacking and slashing,1
"(uhh) If you try to count how many limbs are lobbed off in this movie even if you limit it to limbs that were lobbed off by the ax, youre still gonna lose count somewhere around ten thousand",0
"I mean this movie is just incredibly (uhh) gory and violent and while it is truer to the comics, (uhh) the comics did have plot lines and story lines and this movie, sadly, is just a convoluted mess of a plot line",0
So I will say that Jason Momoa did a fairly good job being Conan and looking like Conan,0

"(umm) But, and I always give it the best, you know, benefit of the doubt and like Im going to sit down and watch this movie Im going to enjoy it you know",0
"If I dont like it, I dont like it, I dont have to watch it again, if I like it, Ill watch it again",0
Well this is one I will probably not watch again,1
"(umm) Guys, nobody, you really wouldnt care about this",1
I really dont think guys will really care about this movie at all,0
"Girls, if youre looking for a birthday present to get your boyfriend or something like that, you would probably want to mark this off your list definitely and (uhh) guys but guys if if (stutter) youre looking for a good movie to give your girlfriend and thats not that expensive, then this will definitely be a good one",0
"(umm) The movie itself, its its (stutter) geared, you know, not for guys, its not action packed or anything like that, (umm) its not really that interesting, its just a lot drama stuff, I mean, I just, I just (stutter) didnt like it at all",0
"(umm) Special features, I mean, they have (uhh) commentary, stuff like that but, I mean, I wasnt even interested in watching them because, I mean, who would really want to watch commentary on something that they didnt like in the first place",0
"So (umm) so yes so, guys, this would be a good movie for your girlfriend just make sure she knows, that you know, youre not gonna watch it with her except for one time",0
"(umm) Girls, dont get this for your guy friends, they they (stutter) wont like it",0
"(umm) Yes but so, so (stutter) guys get it for your girlfriends and girls get it for yourself but, anything other than that, you probably wanna skip over it",0
"Hello, Im Matthew, and Im here to tell you about this DVD and its called Ultraviolet",1
"(umm) This is a science-fiction movie made by the same director of the movie Equilibrium, which was an excellent movie",1
"I had high expectations, (umm) because this was, like I said, from the same director of Equilibrium and I was very disappointed",0
"(umm) Its a sci-fi movie but its very confusing, very choppy, (umm) its kind of corny too",0
And it stars the same girl that was in (umm) The Fifth Element and Resident Evil,1
(umm) The only redeeming thing about this movie is probably the actress thats in it,0
"(umm) She wears very little clothing and thats probably the only redeeming quality, is seeing her run around in (umm) belly shirts",0
But this is a horrible movie,0
Hey my names Scott and today Im doing a review on a DVD that I probably shouldve rented before I went out and bought it,0
"(umm) Heard a lot of good reviews about it and a lot of people seem to love this movie, but (umm) when I actually went out and bought the DVD and watched it, I was really disappointed",0
(umm) I just really didnt like the movie too much,1
"(umm) I know a lot of people loved it and a lot of people think Im crazy for not enjoying it, but it just wasnt my kind of film",1
(uhh) The storyline just kind of seemed to drag until it finally got into some action,0
"But (umm) this is, (uhh) it has, it has (stutter) a decent amount of special features on it",0
"all different audios, in (uhh) Mandarin, (uhh) English, French, has subtitles in English and French, (uhh) it has the Making of special, a widescreen presentation, a conversation with Michelle Yeoh featurette, a photo montage, link to website, filmographies, animated menus, production notes, and (uhh) scene selections",0
"So, (umm) its been compared to like The Matrix in ways like that, with sword-fighting and things like that",1
(umm) Just wasnt really my kind of film,1
"(umm) But, you know, you might want to give it a try",1
Might say to rent it before you buy the DVD though,0
"(uhh) But if you did like it and you dont have the DVD, definitely pick it up because it does have a lot of good special features",1
Right here with me today I have the (umm) little heard of DVD called From Justin to Kelly,1
(umm) This is actually a musical which came out (umm) a few years ago so (umm) of course its not as a famous anymore,1
(umm) Its got Americas favorite (umm) (stutter) people from the American Idol show (umm) Kelly Clarkson and Justin (uhh) Guarini,1
(umm) So thats of course the two (stutter) major (umm) stars in this show,1
(umm) Because these are great (umm) two very talented singers of course this has got to be a musical,1
Its about (umm) a few people going with their friends to Miami for spring break and then they (uhh) meet up,1
"Its got a lot of music, its got a lot dancing and (uhh) basically the fun never stops in the sun",1
"So (umm) I wouldnt really recommend getting this because its (uhh) theres a reason it wasnt, it didnt get (umm) such good (uhh) ratings because its actually quite (stutter) a boring (uhh) plot",0
"Theres not much of a plot to it, its just (uhh) people dancing and singing on the beach and (umm) thats about it",0
"So if youre looking for something with a good plot (umm) I wouldnt suggest this, but maybe if youre looking for something like a sing along type I would suggest this because (uhh) the (umm) the the (stutter) subtitles actually (umm) the captions and everything actually show up as theyre saying the words so its almost like a sing along kind of movie",1
"Hello Rebel, and welcome back to my life",1
"I did get a haircut, thanks for noticing",1
"No, but clearly, something is different on my face",1
I’m growing my beard back,1
"Turns out I thought my wife really liked the goatee, but we had a conversation a couple of weeks back, and I was like, “I’m glad you like the goatee better, because I find it very fetching,” and she kind of went silent for a really long time",1
"Like, so long I wondered if there was a short-circuit between my brain and my mouth and I had accidentally complimented the good looks of another woman, instead of, like, my own facial hair",1
"But yeah, she said she likes the full beard better, and I like it, too, so it’s coming back",0
Also I got glasses,0
"Yeeeah, this is still a LITTLE weird, I’m not entirely used to it",1
"Like, I keep reaching up to adjust my glasses when they slide down my nose, and every time I’m like, “Oh my god, Im adjusting my GLASSES",1
"” So when we moved up here in August, I was driving a truck for three days straight, and I noticed that when I was driving at night, the headlights and tail lights of the other cars were getting a little bit blurry",1
"It wasn’t anything crazy, but it was definitely a higher level of blur than I had previously experienced in my life, which was, like … none",1
"So the day after my birthday I finally went to the optometrist and found out that I have a mild astigmatism, which makes long-distance vision a little bit blurry, especially at night",1
"The optometrist said I only really HAVE to wear them when Im driving at night, but when I put them on, everything became so much clearer that I just … wear them all the time now",1
"The first day I got my glasses, I was a little bit down",1
"I’ve always had perfect vision, and so it felt in a sense like I was “losing” that",1
"But both of my parents had glasses since before I was born, so this is not some, like, huge surprise out of nowhere",0
It was pretty much inevitable,1
"And after that first day, once I’d gotten used to wearing them, I found out that I actually really like how they look",1
"I mean, for one thing, if you tell people you’re a writer, I feel like they’re a lot more likely to take you seriously if you DO have glasses than if you DON’T",1
"But also, I feel—and I know this sounds kind of stupid—but I feel like the glasses complete my face in this weird way",1
"Like I’ve never really hated the way I look, but I’ve never thought I was super good-looking either",0
"And the glasses have definitely caused an improvement in my concept of my own self-image, whatever that’s worth",1
I don’t know that I chose the best possible frames,1
I might upgrade those at some point,1
"And I definitely need to get non-glare lenses, since as you can see, they have a tendency to reflect the lights I use to make my videos",1
"But overall, yeah, I like myself better with glasses than without them",1
"There is one other aspect of this whole thing, though, which is less than completely ideal",1
And that’s that … it DOES make me feel a little old,0
"No, glasses are not exclusive to old people",0
A lot of kids wear glasses from a very young age,1
"My son Luke is getting his eyes checked in April because we’ve known for a long time that he will almost DEFINITELY need glasses growing up, and he’s finally of the age where he will PROBABLY not break them",1
But I wasn’t born with eyes that needed glasses,1
It happened because I got old,1
"Also gonna be real weird every time I go back and watch one of my old YouTube videos, which I do every once in a while, and see myself without the glasses",1
Not probably never gonna get over that system shock,1
"The way I feel isn’t exactly a mid-life crisis, but it’s kind of akin to one",1
But it’s also made me realize that I’m pretty okay with where I am at this point in my life,1
"I’m 31, I make a living as an author, I’ve got an incredible wife and three wonderful children, we got a real nice house in a real nice town in Oregon",1
Were probably gonna be getting our own house in the not-too-distant future,1
"If that’s the situation Im in as I move into my new bespectacled life as a middle-aged man, I’m sort of okay with it",1
"And that is all Ive got for you today, Rebel",1
"You know, the Lord Jesus convicted me of having false fronts, when I am out in public.",0
"You know, we dont want to look, vulnerable, or we dont want to look like we are not busy.",1
"So when we go out in public we try to keep calm and collected, but.",0
"IF you do not have Jesus on the FRONT of YOU, then you will not bear witness for Jesus, you will NOT testify because you are too cool, or you are too busy.",1
"I see a lot of people going around with a false front, they pretend that they are SO busy with their cell phones, that they are too busy to talk.",1
Or they are too cool. If you watch them they act like they are WAY to cool to talk to anyone.,0
But these things will HINDER YOU if you are trying to live for Jesus.,0
Tammy and Eric were faced with an agonizing decision,0
We said we could deliver at that point,1
"Her survivability was quoted, basically, at 0%",1
"The other option was to try to get her to 27 weeks, and then deliver her with a survivability-- probably still under the 5% number",1
"Tammy was put on bed rest, every other day she went to the hospital to see if the baby was still alive",1
"TAMMY: I remember every day, sitting in the car before we would walk into the clinic",0
"It was-- you take a big, deep breath, and you prepare yourself that theres not going to be a heartbeat today",0
"And every time, there was a heartbeat",0
"NARRATOR: At 27 weeks, the doctor told Tammy she had to deliver the baby immediately, or the baby would die",0
They prepared Tammy for a c-section,0
"One of the best ways to articulate your skills, experience, knowledge, and your overall worth in todays competitive job market is to create your personal brand",1
I feel that a personal brand is obligatory and it helps you stand out in the crowd,1
"According to the management expert and author Tom Peters, we are CEOs of our own companies, Me Inc",1
"To be in business today, our most important job is to be the head marketer of our own personal brands",1
This is the first of a 2-part video on personal branding,1
"In this video, I will share 7 pointers on personal branding to get you started",1
"First, determine your unique value proposition",1
Spend some time thinking about what makes you different from your peers,1
"Identify your strengths, your passions, and your goals",1
"If you left your job today, what would your company &amp; colleagues miss? Know who you are and who you are not",1
"Second, find out how others see you",1
"Ask your trusted colleagues, co-workers, and friends for four or five adjectives they would use to describe you",1
Try to find out what are you good at,1
"What are your strengths? In which areas do they see you as irreplaceable? Third, identify your goals",1
Where would you like to be in six months? In one year? In five years? In ten years? Defining your goals is necessary to craft a message that helps you reach them,1
"Fourth, identify your target audience",1
"Just like Starbucks knows that their target audience is coffee drinkers, you need to define to whom you want to send your message",1
"This will not only help you hone your message, but, it also helps you deliver it to the right people at the right places",1
"Fifth, reorganize your priorities",1
"You are probably used to putting yourself behind your company, co-workers, and clients",1
"You still want to be loyal to those groups, but, be loyal to yourself, first",1
"Sixth, pay attention to the details",1
Everything you do ultimately contributes to your personal brand,1
"Once you have defined your brand, make sure that those little things, such as the way you dress, the way you speak, your body language, your behavior with colleagues and other stakeholders the emails you write, etc",1
are consistent with your brand message,1
"Seventh, update your CV or Resume",1
Go through your CV or Resume to determine whether it gels with your personal brand,1
"Ensure that your CV or Resume accurately defines who you are, and is in line with your short-term and long-term goals",1
"In the next video, I will share 7 more pointers on personal branding",1
"As an entrepreneur, when you start working with an investor, there are some compromises that are going to have to be made.",1
"And one way of thinking about that is when you make your first pitch to an investor, the investor starts formulating in their mind what they think this company should become, what the product should be.",1
And that may not be the same idea that you have in your head as the entrepreneur.,1
"And actually, part of picking the right investors is, is there alignment between these visions, the vision that the investor shares and the vision that the entrepreneur shares?",1
"And no matter how close those two visions are, sometimes theres going to be some differences.",1
"And as an entrepreneur, what you have to decide is when the investors vision is slightly different, are you going to adjust?",0
Are you going to course correct?,1
"And when youre thinking about doing that and youre thinking about those compromises, its important to take a step back and think about it from the investors perspective.",1
Theyre not in the weeds.,1
How important is your pre-trial testimony in your accident or medical malpractice case here in the state of New York?,1
You wanna learn the answer?,0
"Come join me, Ill tell you.",1
"Hi, Im Gerry Oginski; Im a New York medical malpractice and personal injury trial attorney practicing law here in the state of New York.",1
Your pre-trial testimony is critical for the purposes of testifying at trial.,1
Why is that?,1
Because it is as if you are testifying at trial even though youre at a question and answer session in your attorneys office.,1
"You might think that its very informal because theres no judge there, theres no jury there, its not a court room but the reality is that every question and answer thats given in that particular case is now recorded into a booklet, you are sworn to tell the truth and that testimony will then come back to haunt you if you testify in a manner that is contradictory at the time of trial.",1
"So the testimony you give during your question and answer session, also known as a deposition or an examination before trial, is critical, it is the same as if you are testifying at trial.",1
It just happens to be done in an attorneys office.,0
SPOKESPERSON KIRBY: The U.S.,1
Government judges North Korea to have conducted a nuclear test yesterday.,1
"We’re still evaluating the North’s claims  about this test, but our initial analysis is not consistent with North Korea’s claim that this was a hydrogen bomb.",0
"In any event, we strongly condemn this violation of UN Security Council resolutions, and again call on North Korea to abide by its international obligations and commitments.",1
We have consistently made clear that we will not accept North Korea as a nuclear-armed state.,0
"Since last night, we’ve been in constant contact with our allies and partners in the region.",0
"Secretary Kerry spoke today over the phone with the foreign minister of the Republic of Korea, Foreign Minister Yun.",1
It seems to me that the best brands increasingly the gap that they have with their lowest performing competitors.,1
"I learned that my mom had a right to own property, I learned that did not have to abused because she was a women",1
Those things made me angry,0
I wanted to do something,0
"Every time I went back, I found that my neighbours girls were getting married, they were getting mutilated",1
"And after I graduated from here, I worked at the UN, I went back to school to get my graduate work, the constant cry of these girls was on my face",0
I had to do something,0
"As I went back, I started talking to the men, to the village, and mothers and I said, I want to give back the way I had promised you that I would come back and help you",1
What do you need,0
"In this clip on how to audition for a Broadway play, Im going to talk about the journey in your monologue.",1
"Not only should you have an objective, and should you know who youre talking to in your monologue, but you want to show a little bit of a character journey, so that you show the casting directors and the producers, and whoever is on that audition panel, that youre an actress who can carry a show.",1
You can go from point A to point B.,1
You are looking at Absorb Healths Grape Seed Extract.,1
Grape seed extract is a powerful and versatile antioxidant.,1
"It has been linked to improved hypertension, decreased inflammation, and increased bone density.",1
"Okay introduction speeches, weve got this bad boy written and were ready to go but Ive got to tell you something really, really important.",1
Be familiar with the person that you are talking about and what you are going to say.,1
Now I know you are thinking that you can wing this.,1
"Youre going to get up there and do it, dont, make yourself some notes.",0
My name is Susan Richmond.,1
I just recently graduated with a first class degree studying forensic science and investigative analysis.,1
The reason I chose Kingston University is probably two reasons.,1
"Firstly, I attended an open day and during that open day I got a really good impression of the university - everybody was friendly, everybody was very welcoming, the talks relating to my course were very interesting, which enabled me to make my final decision.",1
"Secondly, I live close to the University - I have a young family and its convenient for me.",0
"The idea of travelling long distances just does not appeal to me, particularly with family life and studies.",1
I studied forensic science and investigative analysis.,1
The course covered quite a broad range of topics.,1
"The topics kind of ranged from forensic bio-psychology to fibres, fires and firearms, forensic archaeology.",1
"I suppose these topics combined with the practical skills that we learnt, such as the crime scene to court scenarios.",0
"Having them combined together gave me a really big insight, or a fantastic insight, into the actual course itself and into forensic science.",1
I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Kingston University.,1
A despicable hate crime was committed this evening in Jerusalem.,1
"In Israel everyone, including the LGBT community, has the right to live in peace, And we will defend that right.",1
I welcome the Israeli religious leaderships condemnation of this terrible crime And I call on all those in positions of leadership to denounce this contemptible act.,1
"In the name of all of Israelis, I wish the wounded a full and speedy recovery.",0
Hey everybody whats up i am doing a review of fast and the furious 7. I saw a prescreener of it last night.,1
This is the seventh installment of the series and Paul Walkers and now a lot of people were wondering what would the series was going to do with Paul Walkers death he filmed about half of the movie and he is in the movie.,0
"I think a lot of people were wondering whether they would just not have his character in the movie, he actually is in the movie for a good portion of it and in fact youll be watching this movie and wondering which scene are they going to off his character at and thats what i was wondering during the entire time of hte movie.",0
Now the story continues off from where the 6th one left off we saw Dominic Teretto and Brian OConnor Paul Walkers character defeat Owen Shaw in the sixth movie and now Owen Shaws brother who is played by Jason Statham is back and he basically wants revenge for his brothers death.,1
The movie introduces some new characters.,1
Iggy Azalea makes a short appearance even if it is for a few seconds.,0
We have kurt russell whose in the movie for a good portion of it.,1
"Well Im very glad to be -- Welcome, everybody, and  thank you for --starting a moment late.",1
I apologize.,1
Im very happy to be meeting today with Marshall Islands President Loeak and with the Samoan Prime Minister Malielegaoi  and other Pacific Island leaders.,0
Were very happy to have all of you here.,1
"This week these leaders and other leaders from around the globe have come to New York during the UN General Assembly to discuss some of the issues of greatest challenge to everybody, life and death issues that impact millions of people around the world.",1
"Climate change is one issue that absolutely impacts millions of people around the world, and no one knows just how deeply serious and present, how now this challenge is and its impacts than the people of the vulnerable Pacific Islands.",0
They have experienced both historic droughts and the highest rates of sea level rise in the world.,0
"So the science is clear and irrefutable, and today the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirmed for the fifth time in 20 years that climate change is real, is happening, and is in large part caused by human activity.",0
including now a retraction of a publication from the journal Nature,1
"So even the most data-savvy companies, Amazon and Google, they sometimes get it wrong",0
"And despite all those failures, data is moving rapidly into real-life decision-making -- into the workplace, law enforcement, medicine",1
So we should better make sure that data is helping,1
"In Texas, what do you need to do to prepare for a temporary order hearing? Hi",1
"Im Eric Engel, a Dallas divorce lawyer with the Engel Law Group here in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area",0
"A temporary order hearing is a hearing in which the court sets the ground rules for who gets what property, what debts get paid, who gets custody of the children, and how much child support - if any - gets paid while the divorce is going through the court system",0
"In Texas, there are four things you need to do to prepare for your temporary order hearing",1
"One: Texas is a conservative state, so you need to be conservatively dressed",0
"This means that if you are a man, you should be wearing a suit and you should be cleanly shaven",1
"If you are a woman, you should be wearing a long dress or a professional business suit",1
Two: you need to arrive to court on time,1
You dont want to be late when it comes to deciding whether or not youre going to be able to keep custody of your kids,1
Three: you want to make sure that youre friendly towards the other and youre friendly towards the court staff,0
"If youre rude to the court staff, this has a way of getting back to the judge who wont take it kindly and may actually make you pay more money or take away custody of your children",1
Four: you want to make sure that you deliver all the papers to the other side into the court in a timely manner,1
Why am I telling you this? Im telling you this because youve just been served with papers for a temporary order hearing or youre preparing for a temporary order hearing yourself in the state of Texas,1
These are the sort of problems we deal with every day,1
"If you find yourself in this situation, pick up the phone and give us a call",1
just this is going to be kind of a dry paste that is how we want it,1
now take this quails and then apply the masala all out just into the gashes just apply,1
"You know, in the roundtables that I held throughout our district, I heard from family members, law enforcement, and treatment specialists, who are trying to deal with this terrible addiction of opioids, of painkillers, thats gotten out of hand.",1
The legislation that weve put forward thats been approved by the House now really will make a difference in our communities over time.,1
"Good morning Hank, its Tuesday.",0
What do I have in common with a Catholic priest?,1
Id just feel naked without my collar.,0
"Its Question Tuesday, the day that I answer real question from real Nerdfighter Just the one question today: Im a college freshman, how do I figure out what the hell to do with my life? Hank, we get some version of this question almost every day, but to answer the question, I have to begin by disagreeing with it.",0
"The whole what do I do with my life? question implies that adulthood is this monolithic creature that like, you acquire your job and your spouse, and then you just ride it out until Times winged chariot shows up.",1
"I thought this when I was younger too, and its not our fault, because how does every single happily ever after movie end?",0
"With finding your one true love and kissing them, occasionally marrying them, at the very latest having a child with them.",1
"95% of romantic stories end with partners committing to each other, because everything after that is just the blank, terrifying morass of adulthood, this monotonous grind in which the only real excitement in your life is occasionally finding a truly ripe avocado at the grocery store.",1
"Now listen, Hank, Im not going to lie to you, I get very excited when I find a truly ripe avocado at the grocery store but its not the only excitement in my life!",1
And let me submit that one of the reasons youre so terrified of figuring out what youre going to do with your life is that you think youre only going to be able to do one thing!,0
"Like if someone told you that in four years you were going to have to pick one musical note to listen to for the rest of your life, you would spend a lot of time being super anxious about which note to pick and the various tonal qualities of different notes.",0
But thats not what life is like!,1
"You will always be figuring out what to do with your life, and youll get to do lots of different things, and your decisions will be unmade by circumstance, like your wife gets a job in Kuala Lumpur, or youre staring at the night sky one night and decide you wanna get a PhD in astrophysics Or your uncle dies and theres no one to take over his junkyard or your little brother starts a frickin video conference... Just like your life now, adulthood will have all this tension between idealism and practicality, and youll have to balance competing desires.",0
"I mean, give yourself some credit!",1
"Even if youre 14 or 15, youre already kind of doing adulthood.",1
"But I think what actually scared me about choosing whether to go to school and what to study was that each time I made a decision, my options narrowed.",1
"Hi, My names Taylor Eubanks, and thank you for being interested in my story.",1
"So, I just want to do a short video telling you why I want to go to Germany and how you can help me get there.",1
It started last summer when i started learning Germany from a friend of mine.,1
"For some reason, as soon as they started teaching me German, i couldnt stop learning the language!",1
"So I would do YouTube videos on how to learn and oddly enough, I started meeting many people in Texas from Germany... and I dont know where theyve been hiding all this time but I started to get suspicious that maybe the Lord was speaking to me to go there.",1
"So I asked him and prayed several times, God do you want me to go to Germany, and what do you want me to do there? and he said Yes. and he wants me to go through a ministry called Greater Europe Mission.",1
"Basically, Europe is a very secular place, and I know Germany is a country in need of Gods love.",1
Only about 2-3% of them are committed Christians.,1
So my goal is to go there this summer from June 10 to August 26 and just love on them like Jesus does and build relationships.,1
"I know whenever you hear the words Mission Trips, you might think of third world countries who need money and resources, but Germany has all that.",1
They just need Gods love.,0
Im so excited to go there.,1

My name is Fernando Nilo.,1
"I am a [inaudible] entrepeneur from [inaudible] and Im here in Davos and I would like to share my dream, mass ideas with the community.",1
"The devil will accuse true Brothers, Our Brethren!",0
He accuses them day and night and brings many accusations against them.,0
"He says they are false brothers; they are hypocrites, that they are prideful, he brings MANY false accusations against them hoping that they will THINK that is from the Holy Spirit and believe those accusations, and stumble and fall, and that they won�t be able to testify of Jesus anymore.",0
The devil is a LIAR and he tries to deceive people.,0
The realm of what actually is and the realm of what ought to be are logically disconnected,0
"For instance, one may not conclude that because stealing is morally and legally prohibited, it does not happen",1
"Conversely, it cannot be concluded either that because stealing does occur in practice, it is morally or legally acceptable",1
"However, although the realm of what ought to be is not logically connected with reality, it does pull it, to some extent, toward what is considered desirable, in the manner of a gravitational force",1
&gt;&gt; Congratulations! You made it to the end of this segment and successfully answered all the quiz questions correctly,1
You may now move onto the next section of this orientation,1
"I understand that I can stop my external speaking, by just not doing it, but how do I stop my internal speaking?",1
"The same way, it’s the same.",1
External and internal is just made up.,1
You know when I was saying that …the way we segment our lives?,1
The major segmentation we make is external and internal.,1

This is Bruce Campbell Versus Army of Darkness the Directors Cut Official Bootleg Edition,1
Now this is probably the worst cut of this movie Ive ever seen,0
It just doesnt sit right with me,1
"(uhh) It has about fifteen minutes of extra deleted material, (uhh) which was deleted for a reason",0
"Its just (uhh) its alright, it just doesnt, its not necessary",0
The thing that really bothers me about this cut is the editing,0
"It doesnt give you an option as to which ending you see, youre stuck with the apocalyptic ending",1
Where if you like that ending then youre probably good with this,1
"But I really didnt like the apocalyptic ending, it just left me disappointed",1
"But (uhh) if you saw the movie, you know what Im talking about",1
"If you didnt, youll have to see it to understand",1
But (uhh) this (uhh) (uhh) it just (uhh) its just (stutter) not a good cut,1
"Its just cause of whoever put in deleted scenes, theyre grainy",0
"(uhh) Like if youre gonna if youre gonna (stutter) do a directors cut where you put in deleted scenes, at least (uhh) make them look as nice as the rest of the movie you know? Because then it just kind of detracts from what youre watching",1
(umm) Okay so I will explain the movie now so I got that out of the way,1
"(uhh) Bruce Campbell reprises his role as Ash in the third installment of the Evil Dead series, though this is Army of Darkness, not exactly Evil Dead",1
(uhh) Its more of an a action comedy than (umm) any of the other ones were horror,0
"Its more of a an action oriented (uhh) one liner spouting hero (uhh) has is (stutter) trapped seven hundred years in the past and in order to get out, he has to find, of course, the Necronomicon",0
And (uhh) and many hijinx ensue with his search for the Necronomicon and (uhh) the resolutions afterwards,0
What goes on afterwards,0
(uhh) But (uhh) he ends up obviously having to take on the army of darkness,1
"(uhh) The thing is though that theres several freight, hes in medieval time basically",0
"(uhh) Very arcane, (uhh) non-technological, but it still goes with the idea that (umm) That (uhh) he (uhh) somehow has the knowledge to (uhh) (uhh) create and build whatever he wants out of what he can find",1
Im here to present to you Man of the Year starring Robin Williams,1
(uhh) It also has the supporting characters of Lewis (stutter) Black and Christopher Walken (stutter) and Jeff Goldblum,1
"But theyre just the supporting characters the other two main characters Laura Linney and the guy that plays the evil face of delacorp, the company that (umm) the company that causes most of the conflict through this movie",1
Werent really people I identified,1
"So (uhh) if youre watching this for the comedy aspects, (uhh) its kind of few and far between but they are funny I will say that, the, (stutter) whenever they try to be funny they are funny",1
But then there are just parts where it gets so dark and so dramatic that (umm) it just kinda overshadows any comedy thats there and just eventually becomes a straight (uhh) suspense drama you know,1
(umm) Like I had complete expectations of seeing Robin Williams (uhh) stand up,1
(uhh) Ive seen some of the comedy works he done (uhh) classic tv shows hes done,1
"But this movie is just (uhh) its, its kind of got a conflict of interest in the story",1
"See the whole story behind this movie is, that Robin Williams plays a character named Tom Dobbs who has a politically charged (uhh) television show, a talk show",0
Where hell (uhh) express his opinions obviously (uhh) much like (uhh) Jon Stewart of the Daily Show or Steve Colbert of the Colbert Report,1
But (uhh) he tongue in cheekingly (uhh) claims that hes going to run for president,0
"And, and this is after an audience, (uhh) an audience member on one of his shows tells him to do this he decides to go through with it",1
"So he does, he runs for president and he actually gets into the, into the into the (stutter) voting system",1
And (uhh) thats where the point is that earlier in the movie they showed there was a glitch in the voting system,1
That the movie is based around the idea that this company has created this voting system that will streamline voting making it easier for the for the (stutter) voter to just go in and just hit a few (stutter) buttons and their votes counted,1
(uhh) But a glitch is discovered early on in the movie but instead of fixing it they create this big (uhh) this big conspiracy story to cover it up,1
"(uhh) There are a lot of elements of that which is actually what ruined the movie for me is it took it away from the comedy and made it more of a (uhh) (uhh) (uhh) the seedy underbelly of, of politics which obviously we know is there, but I just, I just wanted something about politics that didnt present that for once that actually just gave you a a (stutter) heres a a (stutter) silly, tongue in cheek rendition of what would happen if a comedian became president heres the country now, you know",0
"I mean some people think yeah but that would just be Idiocracy you know, which Mike Judge did that movie, but no, it wouldnt I mean Robin Williams has a lot of great points in his stand up his character also has a lot of great points which reflects",0
"But just the direction they went with it just showed a lack of creativity and they just decided to go with the paranoia angle instead of the comedy angle, which I think they should have focused on",1
"But (umm) the lengths that the company goes to, the company by the way with the unnamed face of I believe the characters name is Matthias played by Dan Murray whos the kind of the face of Delacorp that makes sure everything goes the, according to plan",0
And his (uhh) representatives played by Jeff Goldblum,0
"So at least you get good actors out of it I mean Robin Williams, Lewis Black, Christopher Walken",1
"(uhh) Which also brings in more (uhh) dramatic elements you know kind of Rocky Balboa ish you know, you know push this issue because Im going through and youll see this, youll see this in the movie",0
"(uhh) (uhh) Laura Linney Jeff Goldblum, (uhh) Delacorp employees and Dan Murray as Matthias playing the lead (uhh) face of Delacorp",0
"But honestly this movie just does not measure up, I did not, I didnt like it",1
I liked the comedy elements I liked what he had to say I like how he handled the debate,0
But pretty much everything (uhh) every other character did other than Christopher Walken or Lewis Black I didnt like,1
Im reviewing the dvd Chasing Liberty,1
Chasing Liberty is about a girl named Anna who is the presidents only daughter,1
(umm) Anna is tired of always being followed around by secret service agents and she really wants to have some fun and enjoy her freedom before she goes to college,0
"While shes on a trip with her parents she meets a boy and they sneak off and travel all over Europe together, and eventually she finds out that the boy had been lying to her all this time and he was really a secret service agent himself",1
So by this time Anna has of course fallen in love with him,1
But after some ups and downs she eventually gets over the fact that he lied to her and realizes that he really did love her,1
"(uhh) This wasnt a horrible movie, it was just too much like every other teenage romantic movie",0
"If you like chick flicks its pretty good, the actors and actresses arent bad and the storyline is kind of cute",1
But it was just kind of cliche,0
"There are not many hunourous, funny poems out there.",1
But here is one by T S Elliot.,1
"The Naming of Cats The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter, It isnt just one of your holiday games; You may think at first Im as mad as a hatter When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.",1
"First of all, theres the name that the family use daily, Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo or James, Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey- All of them sensible everyday names.",1
"There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter, Some for the gentlemen, some for the dames Such as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter-- But all of them sensible everyday names.",1
"Hi, today Im going to be reviewing the movie MouseHunt",1
"(umm) Its supposedly the funniest movie of the year, it says on the DVD",1
It stars Nathan Lane and Lee Evans,1
"(umm) Its (uhh) PG, and its about an hour and thirty minutes",1
"(umm) It has some special features on the DVD of (umm) production notes, cast and filmmakers biographies and stuff",0
"Not too much, but (uhh) the movie itself (umm) is okay",1
"(umm) Well, its supposed to be the funniest movie of the year, but {sigh} I dont really think thats true",0
(umm) Its kind of one of those silly type of funny movies,0
(umm) So I dont know if you enjoy that,1
"(umm) I tend not to like those {noise} type of movies, because I dont know, theyre not really funny to me",0
"But, if you wanna check it out, its okay to see maybe once or twice",0
"Oh boy, this one is bad",0
Its (uhh) Covert One: The Hades Factor,0
"(uhh) Its (stutter) based on a series of silly (umm) FBI, CIA kind of government secret agent novels",0
(umm) This ones called The Hades Factor,0
Its about (uhh) the disease thats starting to breakout and (uhh) this agent has to discover the source before it breaks out everywhere and kills millions of people,1
It stars (uhh) Mira Sorvino and Stephen Dorff,0
(uhh) The movie unfortunately goes on and on and on,1
It feels like its never gonna end and thats not helped by the fact that its over two and a half hours long,0
I think it actually comes in at almost two hours and forty-five minutes,0
"Do yourself a favor, dont watch this",1
(uhh) Theres no reason to sit through three hours of bad movie,0
Hello there,1
My name is Adam and (uhh) right now I am going to review the movie called Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,1
(umm) This movie is directed by Ang Lee,1
"It was released (uhh) few years ago I guess now (umm) and (uhh) its got (uhh) some interesting (uhh) special effects, a lot of (uhh) wired effects where people are flying around and that and (uhh) it was (uhh) as you can see in the front here, winner of four academy awards",1
It was very well reviewed and liked by the critics,1
(umm) The (uhh) DVD itself has a lot of special features on it,1
(uhh) Its got a lot of behind the scenes things and all that,1
"(uhh) I will be perfectly honest though, (umm) I didnt really find this movie that interesting, I found it hard to follow what was going on, and (uhh) it just wasnt my cup of tea at all",0
"(umm) I would probably give it maybe (uhh) at best a two out of five, (uhh) you know, because its (uhh) international film, you know, (stutter) so give you a little bit of different culture (umm) which I get is, is (stutter) you know kinda interesting, but (uhh) I (uhh) probably wouldnt recommend people going to see this",0
Its (uhh) a renting,1
"WAS COMPLETED, I THINK, BY THE MARCH",1
OR YOU COULD SAY IT WAS COMPLETED BY THE FOUR LITTLE GIRLS WHO WERE KILLED AFTER THE MARCH,0
"THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY MARCH AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE BOMBING OF THAT CHURCH, WHERE KENNEDY WAS AND WHY HE WAS MOVING",0
"HIS LAST WORDS, AS HE GOT ON THE PLANE GOING TO DALLAS, WERE CHEERFUL BECAUSE HE HAD GOTTEN THE WORD THAT THE CIVIL-RIGHTS BILL THAT HE HAD SENT UP WAS GOING TO BE PERMITTED TO GO TO THE FLOOR BY THE KEY COMMITTEE THAT WAS BLOCKING IT",1
"Hi, today Im presenting a movie opinion on the movie Employee of the Month",1
(uhh) This movie is starring Dane Cook and Jessica Simpson,1
It also has Andy Dick in it,1
(umm) I would give this movie about a five out of ten,1
"(umm) The acting wasnt any particularly very good and it wasnt very funny, its supposed to be a comedy",0
I would say its for (umm) people between the ages of about thirteen to twenty-five in that range,1
"(umm) It had its moments but for the most part its just one of those (umm) stupid comedies (umm) its about a employee of this like, store who (umm) does slacks off a lot and (umm) this really pretty girl, Jessica Simpson, who moves to the store and he finds out that she really likes employees of the month",0
So he starts out working really hard trying to get employee of the month so he can win the girl,1
"And so he runs and he also has an, an (stutter) enemy in the store whos also trying to get employee of the month and so they fight over the position",0
And so its kind of entertaining but I wouldnt recommend watching it unless youre pretty bored,0
"Hi, today Im presenting a movie opinion on a movie thats in theaters right now called The Hills Have Eyes Two",1
"(umm) I thought this movie was really, really bad",0
"(umm) Its supposed to be scary and stuff, but I didnt really feel scared, it was just like a lot of goriness and stuff to it",0
"(umm) I didnt really like the acting, I didnt really know anybody that was in it, so (umm) I thought it would be scary (umm) the previews made it look like that but it really wasnt",0
"(umm) Its about these like, (uhh) like (stutter) training guys that are (uhh) in the desert and on their last day they get attacked by these mutants",1
"(umm) Theyre national guard trainees, and (umm) I dont think like its not very good, its not very gore, like the goriness sucks, the acting sucks, (umm) the storyline sucks, its just like one of those like, (uhh) like, (stutter) there its like a typical horror film that they tried to make scary and stuff but I didnt really feel like it was like that at all",0
"Hi, today Im presenting the movie Pride, which is playing in theaters right now",1
"It has (uhh) Tom Arnold, (umm) Bernie Mac and a guy named (stutter) Terrance Howard",1
"(umm) Im not really sure who he is, (umm) but hes the lead actor",1
"(umm) Its about this guy who starts, finds kind of like this abandon pool, and starts like a (umm) swimming team for troubled youth and (umm) I would not recommend this movie",0
It was absolutely terrible,0
The acting was terrible,0
It wasnt very good at all,0
It would just be a waste of money,1
(umm) It also got terrible reviews from professional critics as well,0
(uhh) I dont know why I went to go see it,0
(uhh) I thought it looked interesting,0
"(umm) But yeah, its a terrible terrible movie and its a waste of time",0
"(umm) Its not a very like, the story line wasnt very good and (umm) the acting seemed kind of corny",0
"The lines they used like, doesnt really seem like real life stuff",0
(umm) They tried to make it like inspirational kind of thing but not really,0
"Hello, Im Matthew and Im here to tell you about this DVD movie",1
It came out in two thousand and five and it is called Birth,1
It stars Nicole Kidman,1
(umm) She plays a recently widow and then it jumps forward to ten years later and she is getting remarried,1
When a mysterious boy comes and pretends to be her husband reincarnated,1
(umm) The acting was okay,1
"(umm) The directing was okay, but I dont know if they were trying to make it (umm) sweet and romantic but it kind of comes off a little creepy, a little weird",0
"(umm) The little boy is about eight or nine in it and shes about thirty, thirty-five",1
"(umm) Late thirties and it comes off kind of creepy, theres (umm) (umm) a nude scene involving her and the young child and shes going to run away with him and (umm) they kiss in the movie and, and instead of coming off sweet and endearing it comes off a little (umm) weird and really creepy and a little uncomfortable",0
MICHAEL JONES: I think its vital.,1
I cant actually think of any taht actually believe will survive long term if they dont.,1
Ive got to wonder who out there is watching Steven Seagall movies,0
I mean obviously I watched this because I hate myself,0
"But (uhh) somebody out there has to be buying these and (uhh) actually enjoying them, so that they continue to buy more of them because he keeps on making movies and I cant figure it out because theyre terrible",0
"And (uhh) I have to actually restrain myself on the couch before I put the movie (uhh) on play to watch it because otherwise I just end up throwing whatever I can find at the tv in an effort to (uhh) (stutter) break it whatever, his smug fat face comes on the camera",0
"(uhh) I guess I should get to the point this movie Black Dawn, (uhh) he plays a ex-CIA agent, (uhh) has to (uhh) stop terrorists from releasing a nuclear weapon",1
Im (uhh) sitting here trying to figure out if Ive ever seen a Wesley Snipes movie that I enjoyed,0
"(umm) I guess the answer is probably no, because (uhh) this is maybe the (stutter) one of the worst movies Ive seen him in so far, and thats saying a lot for (uhh) Wesley Snipes",0
"This movie is called The Marksman, this is the DVD release",1
(uhh) Its ninety-five minutes long,1
There are no special features on here at all,0
"(umm) It is high-def but (uhh) doesnt matter, its a bad movie",0
"(umm) He plays a special forces soldier who has to go stop Russian terrorists at a nuclear power plant and (uhh) there, youve seen the whole movie",0
"(uhh) Like I said, theres no special features on here",0
"(uhh) I really didnt care that much because I wouldnt have wanted to see them anyway, but (uhh) this movie is just a real stinker",0
"Hi, Im reviewing the DVD release of (uhh), Python",1
"(umm), If youve seen Lake Placid, or Anaconda, or any of those, this is basically just a, a rip-off of those",0
"And, (uhh), since its ripping of a couple of pretty poor movies, its probably no surprise that this ones even worse",0
"(umm), The first thing going against it is that there stars Casper Van Dien, who in my opinion, has never been good in anything except for maybe Starship Troopers",0
"(umm), Theres no special features on the disc",0
(uhh) Which may be a blessing because once the movies over you wouldnt want to see anymore anyway,0
"But, (uhh), this movie is basically about an hour and a half of (uhh), poorly done special effects",0
A computer generated snake chasing around (uhh) man and naked girls,0
I know that sounds good but (stutter) its not,0
Hi,1
Today Im going to be reviewing the movie Best Laid Plans,1
It stars Reese Witherspoon,1
(umm) Relationships can be murder,0
(umm) Its the special edition,0
(uhh) Its rated R and (umm) {mumble} one and a half hours long,0
"(umm) The movie is about (umm) a guy (umm) who (umm) owes some money and (umm) he (umm) ends up robbing and it go, ends up being bad",0
"(umm) And so hes left (umm) owing this guy money in, like, 48 hours or hes going to die",0
"And since his robbery went bad (umm) he takes what the movie says, desperate measures to (umm) well, undertakes drastic measures to get his hands on some fast cash",1
"But (umm) he works with his girlfriend, who is Reese Witherspoon (umm) to (umm) get some cash quick to pay of his (umm) debt",0
"(umm) It has some bonus features (umm) some deleted scenes, alternate endings, cast and crew bios, and other stuff like that",1
"(umm) But as for the movie itself, (umm) I didnt really care for it",0
"(umm) My husband liked it, but (umm) I thought it was pretty boring",1
(umm) Thats it,1
I just didnt care for it,0
"Its kind of like a, its a (stutter) drama movie, action",1
"Hey there we are talking about introductory speeches and now you get to find out the golden number, the time limit.",1
ROBBIE TRAUBE: The direction that we see it is theres a pervasive nature of how you can leverage some of the creation of content and so.,1
"Hi, the Two Witnesses are here, Peter and Mary.",1
"Hey, whats up? Okay, today Im going to be reviewing a movie",1
This is Nicolas Cage,1
Hes in this movie called Gone in Sixty Seconds,1
"Gone in Sixty Seconds is a remake of a seventies film by the same name and basically its about a car a car (stutter) thief gang that has to steal a certain number of cars within a short period of time, and (uhh) this movie involves a lot of car chases obviously, and it involves a lot of fast cars, a lot of fancy cars",0
Youll see lots of Ferraris and Lamborghinis,1
"If you like (uhh) if you like that kind of thing then this, this movie could be for you",0
"I was actually disappointed, I was hoping for a lot more, I dont know why",1
Ive been disappointed by Nicolas Cage many times,1
(uhh) Also this is a Jerry Bruckheimer film and (umm) I dont really like Jerry Bruckheimer,1
"I dont think he (uhh) I dont think he really cares about making good movies, he cares about making movies that make money",1
"So its lots of explosions, lots of action, but not necessarily a lot of interesting action",0
It doesnt always seem motivated plot wise,0
"(uhh) Ultimately if you havent seen it, if you havent seen Gone in Sixty Seconds go rent this original seventies version, youll probably get more entertainment out of that",0
I give (uhh) the modern Gone in Sixty Seconds two out of five,0
"How many times do I have to tell you to clean up your room? Sound familiar? Your adolescent is going to test you in many ways - from a challenge to clean up their room, to your position on world peace",0
So what is the parent supposed to do? My suggestion to you is to pick your battles very wisely,1
"Not every situation requires a big battle, and its important for parents and adolescents to navigate those waters and figure out which battles are worth fighting",1
So how to do that? I have three points for you,1
"First point, most important point",1
Take a step back,1
Give yourself a few minutes to sort out the situation,1
"As youre considering what to do about this reaction from your adolescent, I suggest you begin by looking at yourself",1
Try to understand why this is so important to you,0
"Why are you feeling the way youre feeling? What is the serious part about this? And what is just the emotional part about this? You kind of have to sort yourself out first, so then you can move ahead and deal with the situation",1
My third point is,0
"youre the adult, so you have to be the adult in the argument",1
You need to figure out a way to navigate the situation so that it doesnt turn into a big conflict,1
"Next Tuesdays video is called the Art of Renegotiation, so if you find this point a little difficult, make sure and join me next week and well talk about it some more",1
There are going to be situations that come up between you and your adolescent that youve got to respond to and theres gonna be problems,1
"As long as youre careful and you pick those battles very wisely, you can guide them and teach them and help them as they mature through this process",1
But think about it,0
"If you use Twitter, youve probably agonized over the construction of a tweet",0
You cant just say whatever you want and go all willy-nilly with your character count,1
There are rules here,1
"Well, actually, theres kind of only one rule",0
Twitters 140-character limit forces you to creative in your tweet construction,1
"Each time Mark made advances toward Marie, shed immediately pretend she was asleep",1
This made for awkward office lunches,0
"And the relationship between constraint and creativity is like peanut butter and jelly, like Toejam and Earl, like John Woo and doves",0
"Self-imposed, technologically determined, or culturally developed, constraint is oftentimes the very basis of creativity",1
Filmmaker Orson Welles even said that the absence of limitation is the enemy of art,1
"Im gonna take that as a sign youre not ready or that its not a good time for you, and so I wont stay in that case",0
"And so youre saying things like, youre not saying You should or You cant, anything about them",1
"Youre saying, This is where I am",0
This is what I can do,1
This is what I require,1
"And making it very, very clear and concrete and drawing a line in the sand that then you have to follow through on",1
You absolutely have to follow through on it,1
And this is really important about the narcissism epidemic thing,1
"If we wanna put an end to that, whats really important is that you do things like this because your kids are watching, and then they will see that you stood up for yourself, you stood up for them, and you ended it here",0
"I made a video a few weeks ago called The Most Important Part of the Pitching Delivery and to summarize that video, I just say that the most important part of the pitching delivery is the beginning because everything that happens later is an effect to what you do in the beginning",0
"For your question specifically about how to get this back leg to not drag around or to get it up more, more up and over heel to sky, two things have to happen",1
Your player may be lacking in one or in both of those areas,0
"The first one is the amount of energy and speed that he creates going down the mount in linear fashion, his linear energy",1
"Now, the first thing that you want to do before you get up and do anything, is I want to take your outline.",1
"Hi, Heidi Thorne.",1
Have you ever gotten a promotional product invoice that was for a quantity more than what you ordered?,1
Thats actually a quality control measure.,1
They are not trying to cheat you.,1
Here is what happens.,1
"When you place your order, the supplier or manufacturer runs more than what youve ordered so that they can spot-check the order and take out any products that dont meet standard, so that they can meet the quantity that you did order.",1
So what were your reactions?,1
I though it was really interesting how he went into dialogue.,1
"Because most people, we think we go into dialogue because that will change our opinions and help shape what we see.",1
"Well, he went into dialogue not to change his opinion.",1
He didnt want to change his opinion.,0
Let’s find out what went wrong.,1
"As usual, looking at a graph clarifies a lot.",1
"In the picture, you see a graph of the left hand side of the inequality, y=1/(x^2-1), in blue and the graph of the right hand side, the horizontal line y=1, in green.",1
The solutions to this inequality lie in the intervals where the blue graph is above green one.,1
"Remember: the boundaries of these intervals can be points at which both sides are equal, that is, where the graphs intersect, but also points where one of the functions is not defined or discontinuous.",1
"And now you can see what went wrong: when we tried to solve the inequality, we found the x-values where the graphs intersect, but we forgot that the left hand side is not defined at two points on the real line.",1
"That really matters here: you see that at these points, the inequality holds on one side, but not on the other.",1
You can see this clearly in the graph.,1
We relied on the graph here.,1
"Sometimes sketching the graph is not an option, because it is too difficult.",0

"[Music] Hi, Welcome to Wave Domain",1
My name is Andi and today what I wanted to do was a one-minute video on averages vs medians,1
"Now, I refer to both of these terms quite a lot when im doing the trend analysis and looking at the sales data so i thought it would be good good idea to make sure that were on the same page with what this means",1
Averages - very simple - take the total sales and divide by the count and that gives you a number that is the average,1
"Now, medians are a little bit more democratic",1
Cos what youre gonna do is youre going to line up all the sales in ascending order and go to that one that the halfway point and thats going to be your median,1
"Now they are much less skewed, medians, are much less skewed by really giant sales at the top end and so that sometimes is a much better indicator of what you might expect to get for one of your names on a typical sale",1
Averages are very useful indicators but you tend to get blown around by those higher numbers at the top end,1
So thats my 52 second definition of averages vs medians,1
Thanks for watching Wave Domain,1

hello there its Ruth Sherman CEO and celebrity speech and media coach but you dont have to be famous to work with me I had to go into new york city for an event last night,1
It was something I was really looking forward to,1
"Anyway a I drove in which was kinda dumb because as you may know the Super Bowl is taking place and and New York has pretty much set aside Times Square, which is right where the meeting was to have been",0
This big picture events this big fun event that has bands in and so forth are celebrating the Super Bowl so I got to New York,0
It took me an extra 45 minutes,1
"usually takes me 45 minutes so it took me twice as long to get there I parked the car in a garage near the event, struggled with the traffic",1
I know I know I should have taken public transportation,1
And then I got to the a venue where the event was supposed to be and found out to my chagrin that the event had been moved had not received a notice so I was not a happy camper,1
Now if you know anything about new york you know that I had to then retrieve my car driver all the way downtown was all the way at the bottom of Manhattan from Time Square it would take me another hour and by that time the event would have been about three quarters over so I decided to just get in the car and go home so and because I was feeling like the you know ugh,0
I was feeling worse than that,1
But when I got to the garage who should be standing there next to me waiting for his car but the amazing and gifted genius Steven Spielberg now even II have a hard time not staring and of course I know being in the celebrity world that you really wanna give these people some space nobody else was approaching him,0
I certainly wasnt going to go up to him and say anything,1
"I didnt want to intrude on his valuable private space, yes, these people just want to be treated like regular human beings even though theyre not",1
But what got me thinking on my way home instead of being angry it got me thinking about his genius of storytelling,1
nobody spins a yarn like Steven Spielberg,1
"and although I recently did a video on storytelling because I get a lot of questions about how many times do I tell the same story, it occurred to me how many times I have seen Steven Spielbergs movies Jurassic Park",1
"Ive seen all three of them at least 10 times each, probably much more",1
"Lost count to be honest with you along with The Color Purple and and Schindlers List so I have seen these movies so many times I know whats going to happen in these movies, I know the outcome, I know when to hide my eyes, I know when I know when its going to be funny, but I still love seeing them",1
I love going on the journey with them with him,1
And this is what happens when you tell the same story over and over again provided its a good one,0
its got to be good,1
All right so people who have heard your story before also want to relive it,0

"I will sell this house today Even with the greater supply, the reality is that its still a buyers market",1
Informed home buyers can find unbelievable deals on mortgages,1
You can look at at interest rates around 3,1
What that really means is that home buyers can afford more house than they would a year from now,1
But how do you lock down such great rates? Its not as simple as just asking for it,0
Real estate expert Geri Willis explains on Howdini,1
You should really put down 20% because that is going to give you skin in the game,1
"This means you can afford this house, lenders are going to take you more seriously and they are going to give you the best terms",0
But dont get ahead of yourself,1
The first step is finding the right house,1
"And even though many home buyers think that buying a brand-new house is as simple as picking up a loaf of bread, thats hardly the case",1
You absolutely should have your own buyers agent and heres why,1
"The seller, the developer is basically protecting their interest",1
Youre excited and you want to buy this new home,1
You look at the model and they give you this contract,1
You have nobody representing yourself as a fiduciary,1
"But, most importantly, where do you even begin your search? Geri Willis is back again with the answer and, heres a hint",1
youre just a click away,1
"What are some tips for accessing the housing market in my area? Well, its pretty easy",1

"And she placed a value in how people expressed themselves — the humor, the inventiveness, the liveliness of language — and her work can be read as a tribute to that",1
"But the different kinds of speech are also, as the scholar Henry Louis Gates points out, a way of acknowledging that there is often a gap between what characters think and how they express themselves",1
"As Gates writes, “[Hurston’s] is a rhetoric of division, rather than a fiction of psychological or cultural unity",1
"” Still, just because the words the characters use are simple, and sometimes misunderstood, that doesn’t mean that there isn’t a great depth of feeling behind them",1

"Club Dread I mean, it was pretty much a huge disappointment",0
"Still kind of funny (uhh) but if you, if youve (stutter) heard of the movie Super Troopers (uhh) basically it has the exact same cast as that movie",0
(uhh) This movie (uhh) is the same same (stutter) people,0
"Its supposed to be kind of like a Super Troopers two, except having nothing to do with that movie",0
"Its you know the next in line of that comedy team, The Broken Lizard",1
"But (umm) I mean it its its its (stutter) an okay movie, its kinda funny",1
"(uhh) But I mean, the thing is to compare it to Super Troopers, which youre supposed to its its (stutter) theres no comparison",1
Super Troopers is just much better,1
(uhh) This movie just it was kind of kind of a disappointment,1
"I dont even know really why I, I (stutter) bought it because I hadnt seen it in theaters and I knew who was in it so I was like, its gotta be good",0
Meh (uhh) Id stick to Super Troopers if I were you,1
"If you have that movie in your library, watch that and then just assume that this movies okay",0
"This is (umm) The Python, the movie The Python and (uhh) its a story about (umm) a doctor, really like a mad scientist, who (umm) develops (uhh) the perfect killing machine and its (uhh) a python",1
"Engineered the perfect killing machine, the worlds first massive genetically enhanced python, and the actors are, lets see (uhh) Jerry McCarthy, Will Wheaton, (uhh) Frayne Rosanoff, Casper (stutter) Van Dien, and Robert Englund",0
Anyway (umm) if you like snake movies then youll this,1
If you like the Anaconda and all those other snake movies youll like this,1
"If you dont like snakes, you will not like this",0
And (uhh) lets see,1
"this particular DVD has outtakes, (uhh) still gallery on pythons, (uhh) biographies on the cast and director, trailers, (uhh) the the English and Spanish subtitles, so (umm), you know I didnt care for it",0
"I mean I dont know if you can see the picture on this but (stutter) that pythons got some huge fangs and (umm) so if you like snake movies, you would like this",0
"If not, Id skip this",0
"Oh, you can get this at Amazon dot com or rent it from (umm) Blockbuster",1
"Hey, how you doing? My name is Roger",1
I want to tell you (stutter) a little bit about this movie called The Karate Kid III,1
"Okay? Yes, thats right, part III",1
They have continued making these sequels to The Karate Kid,1
"Now, the first movie was great",0
"It had (umm) Pat Marita and Ralph Macchio, and it was Daniel-san and his sensei, Myagi, and it was about how they first met, how they (umm) fought, (umm) I mean, how he taught him how, Myagi taught Daniel how to do karate",1
"The second one was, you know, took it down the next road, where they went to, back to (umm) Okinawa and, you know, (umm) Myagi, they got hooked up in some kind of feud",1
"Well, the third one here (umm) with the same characters, which is good because it has the same exact characters, it just keeps going on and on, (umm) it talks about this feud",1
Now Myagi and Daniel are kind of on opposite ends,1
(umm) Daniel wants Myagi to help him get ready for a tournament and (umm) Myagi doesnt want to do it,1
So its its (stutter) about them being on opposite ends,0
"And the guy who Daniel ended up going to is an old nemesis of Myagis, and so you got that drama there",0
Okay? But its just its just (stutter) not as good as the originals,1
(umm) the original Karate Kid,1
"But Ill tell you, I mean, if youre watching them, you might as well go ahead and see the, you know, all of the Karate Kids as they go into it",1
"But it is (umm) you know, it does star the same people",0
It is rated PG because its dealing with fighting and karate and things like that,1
"But its its its (stutter) worth just taking a look if theres no other thing out there to watch and youve, you (stutter) get the whole set",1
Okay? Just so you can kind of see it,0
"But, like I said, the farther down you go on the sequels, they dont quite get as good as the first one was",1
"But (uhh) The Karate Kid III, starring, (umm) you know, Ralph Macchio and Pat Marita, (umm) go take a look at it if you wanted to move, keep on moving down The Karate Kid road",1
Okay,1
Saving Private Ryan,1
This movie rules,1
"(umm) Its won so many awards, it was the best grossing (uhh) highest actually, highest grossing film of ninety-eight",1
"(uhh) Its two hours and forty-nine minutes long, and (uhh) its pretty much on every top hundred list in the world for movies",1
"(umm) Steven Spielberg won a ton of like, (uhh) highest honors from the army and stuff like that too, that thats (stutter) how good this movie was, like it was very realistic and it told from the perspective of a soldier",1
So it starts off (umm) with the invasion of Normandy,1
And the problem is (umm) Private Ryan has three brothers in the war as well and they all die,1
And so Tom Hanks is the main character and his goal to the entire thing is to find Private Ryan and bring him back to his mom so that she doesnt lose four sons,1
"(umm) And they, and (stutter) embark on the epic journey where theyre trying to decide why are we trying to save this one guy, its its (stutter) a war, like people die",1
Why are we saving one guy and theres eight of us risking our lives for this one guy,1
And so the whole story takes place them trying to decide that for themselves as they go and find him,0
And Matt Damon plays Private Ryan,1
"And (uhh) overall Id say its a great movie, it definitely entertaining even though its long",0
"It, you wont, you wont (stutter) fall asleep in this one",0
Wanted to review this movie Washington Square,0
(uhh) It stars (uhh) Ben Chaplin and Jennifer Leigh,1
And its a story that takes place in the eighteen hundreds in New York,1
"And you have an (uhh), lets see upper class (umm) doctor and (uhh) and his homely daughter and (uhh) (stutter) you have this charming (uhh) guy that comes along, played by Ben Chapling, Chaplin, who is (umm) you dont know if he really loves the homely daughter or if hes out for her money and so thats the plot of the story",0
And (umm) its really a boring story,1
"I think the story (stutter) I think the movie is like an hour and fifty-five minutes but the whole, the whole time (stutter) youre waiting to, and youre waiting (stutter) and thinking that somethings going to happen thats going to make the show interesting and before you know it the show is over with and that exciting thing never did happen",1
"So (umm), you know, I found it boring and I would probably give it, you know, maybe a three out of five rating",0
"(uhh) But you can get, you know, you can get Washington Square at Amazon dot com or you can borrow it and rent it",0
"Some people may like it because (umm) its in the eighteen-hundreds, maybe mid eighteen-hundreds to late eighteen-hundreds and so (umm) its interesting watching the social life of that era",0
"That was, that was (stutter) really interesting",1
"And so for that reason some some (stutter) people may to want to watch it just to see the, you know, the social life of that era",1
But other than that I really didnt care for it,0
Will Travers here at the CITES Standing Committee meeting in Geneva.,1
"Well, two things that I should report on today: Before we came here one of the issues that we had,  was this issue called the decision-making mechanism. What that was doing was looking at what kind criteria there might need to be in order for there to be a future trade in ivory.",1
Today Im reviewing Snakes On A Plane,1
"(uhh) Pretty funny movie, (uhh) pretty corny movie actually",1
(umm) Im very surprised that a actor notorious as Samuel L,0
Jackson would agree to do a movie quite like this,0
(uhh) I guess you know moneys money so if you get paid for this movie you get paid for something else and you dont really have to try to act too hard in this movie,0
"(uhh) Basically starts out, a guy witnesses a murder",0
Samuel L,0
"Jacksons an FBI agent, gonna protect him",0
(uhh) And then they get on a plane and the (uhh) the mobsters try to put snakes on a plane to kill everybody,1
"Is basically how the movie you know, starts out",0
"(uhh) Personally I thought it was pretty (uhh) it was just really corny, and I mean its kind of interesting to see what they could possibly do with snakes on a plane",1
"(uhh) I could see like maybe like attack eagles on a plane, because you know, eagles fly and planes fly but like snakes on planes you just, its a concept thats really out there",1
"(uhh) And then the snakes, its just, its kind of a more low budget film, the CG snakes, computer generated so theyre not very realistic",1
&gt;&gt; Hi this is Bill Baldwin.,1
Im answering the question should businessmen have a code of ethics that they have to answer to.,1
Im wondering whether any dishonest executive would be made more honest by having a code.,0
"Today, Im reviewing Event Horizon",1
This is the (uhh) the special collectors edition,1
"It stars (uhh) Laurence Fishburne, Kevin Costner, and (uhh) also Joely Richardson, who is (uhh) the who stars in (uhh) Nip Tuck, which is a great show",0
(uhh) Event Horizon its a really cool concept actually event horizons actually (uhh) the point in space in which you cant get sucked or which outside of you cannot get sucked in to a black hole,0
So its basically the (uhh) the furtherest extent of a black hole,0
Its kind of a sphere,1
"(umm) So its a really cool concept in terms of the (uhh) the science behind it and then, you know, what happens if you were to get closer",1
"(uhh) But its just, its just (stutter) a really gross movie",1
"Its one of those movies that like its scary movie, too",1
(umm) But its real gross,1
"Theres just nasty blood and guts and disgusting things hanging out all over this spaceship that basically goes to an alternate dimension, or hell, and then comes back and then these people go and try to rescue it because they think its been a long lost (uhh) spaceship",0
"(umm) So, I wouldnt really (stutter) recommend this movie",0
I dont think it was very good,0
"Hey, how you doing? My name is Roger",1
I want to tell you a little bit about this (uhh) movie called the Master of Disguise,0
Now I will you that this is probably one of the biggest wastes of ninety minutes that Ive ever done in my life,0
"This is one of the most stupidest movies, (umm) and it was a complete (umm) insult for me to even watch it",0
It was that dumb,0
So I will tell you dont bother,0
If you see it keep walking by,0
"Now Dana Carvey, I mean hes the, you know (stutter) its, hes the main guy in the movie",0
"Now I I (stutter) used to watch him on Saturday Night Live and, you know, it was funny",0
"But in this movie hes a detective and hes in all, he goes in all kinds of different disguises to to to (stutter) do (umm) to to to (stutter) go after the bad guy, I cant remember exactly, I dont even remember why hes going after him",0
I just remember it was just so ridiculously stupid,0
"(umm) I mean theres some stupid funny movies out there but this (umm) I mean it it (stutter) you had to have the maturity of maybe a five year old to really, really think this is a funny movie",0
"So I will tell you Dana Carveys Master of Disguise, if you see it just keep right on going",0
"Its not worth the ten dollars, its not worth the five dollars",1
If someone gives you the movie its not worth the time to even watch it,1
"So dont even think about it, dont look at the name of it except the fact of saying ooh never get that movie",0
"Hi, Im here with The Matrix Revolutions",1
This is the final movie in the Matrix Trilogy,1
Im giving this movie a two out of five,0
"I love the first Matrix, the second Matrix had amazing action and special effects and I liked it too",0
However I did not like this third movie,0
I felt they could have ended the trilogy so much better,0
Almost the entire movie was like (stutter) two battles,0
One in the real world and one in the matrix and it (stutter) didnt feel like that much happened in this movie,0
The movie just felt like really short and (stutter) the ending just wasnt that good,0
The dialogue was pretty bad,0
Keanu Reeves Keanu Reaves acting was like a lot worse than the first two movies,1
He has a lot of one-liners and hes confused a lot of the movie,0
(uhh) {clears throat} He (stutter) doesnt show a lot of emotion,0
"(uhh) Theres this one fight with Neo and Agent Smith that like (stutter) there was like a billion Agent Smiths but he only fought one so it was kind of disappointing cause I I (stutter) thought it would be a crazy fight with every Agent Smith against Neo, but no, it was just one",0
(umm) And that fight was kind of disappointing,0
It was basically a rip-off of Dragon Ball Z,0
"(umm) The DVD has some extra features, some behind the scenes stuff but I dont think that makes it worth buying",0
I will now be reviewing Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie For Theaters,1
(umm) Let me first off start by saying that I absolutely hate the show Aqua Teen,0
I think its horrible,1
"Ive never been able to watch a full episode, when I do Im just kind of like (uhh) thats what Im like",0
"So I didnt want to go to see this movie but somebody paid for my movie ticket, so I went",0
And I expected to fall asleep but I did not,1
"The beginning of the movie starts out with this little dancing, these little dancing (stutter) food people",1
And that part was probably the most hilarious part of the movie,0
In my opinion,0
So if anything go to see that,0
If you like the show youll like the movie,1
"If you dont like the show, you will not like this movie but you wont dislike it as much as you like the show",1
"I could have about halfway in the movie its like I, I (stutter) think Id seen enough",0
{noise} I wanted to leave,0
Whoops sorry,1
I wanted to leave but I couldnt because I was there with a friend and she would not leave and she paid for my ticket so how could I really leave,1
(umm) I really have no further comment on this movie because I zoned out for most of it,1
So I would just say that (uhh) do not see it {laugh} if you dont like the show,1
"Thats my, my (stutter) advice for you guys",0
If you like the show see it though,1

"Ancient and modern slavery are more alike than many people often recognize, but there is this true, genuine, fundamental difference that ancient slavery is not race-based",0

"For whatever reason, if we were able to see patients within 16 days, seeing them before that time they do better, but if we see them after that time the risk of chronic pain is actually increased",0

It gets to be bad enough that we go see our Physician,0
"Our Physician then gives us, perhaps, some medications and says, you know, rest and take it easy",0
Well two weeks go by of taking it easy,1
Our pain isnt any better,0
"All the sudden weve lost four, maybe six, weeks and then you see your Physician again and they send you to Physical Therapy",0
Weve already lost that magic window of 16 days in which most patients are going to improve,0
"Now in order to be the most efficient and effective in responding to your messages that come in via email, theres two things that you need to do.",1

"Hi, in this video we are going to take a look at one of the most important activities in New Eden: Manufacturing.",1
"All manufacturing starts with blueprints,  which can be bought on the market or through contracts.",1
Be sure to watch the Flight Academy tutorial  on blueprints for more information.,1
"As an example, let’s manufacture a Rifter, one of the most iconic and accessible ships in the game.",1
"Once you have a blueprint for a Rifter, you will need to find a location capable of manufacturing it.",1
The easiest way to do this is to open  the Industry window and select the Facilities tab.,1
You can then filter to find a facility which is accessible to you.,1
In this case we will look for a public facility  which can handle manufacturing.,1
"Using different facilities will cost different amounts of ISK, based on the tax rate set by their owners and the Industry System Index.",1
The Industry System Index is determined by  the amount of industrial activity taking place in the system.,0
"For example, if there is a lot of manufacturing going on, then you will be charged more  for manufacturing in that system.",0
"Once you have decided on a facility,  you will need to move your blueprint there.",1
But you will need more than just a blueprint to manufacture.,1
Each blueprint will list what materials and skills  are required in the Show Info window.,1
"However, it’s often easier to right click and select ‘Use Blueprint’. This will show the blueprint in the Industry window and show what is needed and how much it costs.",1
"Remember, you do not need to own a Blueprint  in order to view it in the Industry Window.",1
Tooltips are available in each section.,1
"For instance, if you hover your mouse over the Job Duration time you can see everything that affects how long your job will take.",1
"You can see that the duration of the job is reduced by skills, implants and even by what facility you use.",1
To the left of the window you will see the materials required.,1
If you hover over any of the materials you will see the amount you have available at the facility  compared to the amount the job will use.,1
"According to a new study by KPMG, the United States has the most innovative building and infrastructure projects.",1
A total of 14 projects in the US were cited as leaders in the infrastructure and city construction industry.,1

"Were still talking about presentation, and something that we want to take a look at when were evaluating a speaker is their face.",1
Not what their face looks like but what they do with their face.,0
"First of all, eye contact.",0
Is the speaker not looking at the audience?,1
Are they perhaps focusing the entire speech on their notes?,1
"Its an outlined speech, but yet theyre never taking their eyes off the outline.",1
Are they looking at one particular person through the entire speech and never looking at the rest of the audience?,1
"Or, are they looking around at everyone in the audience, which is what they should be doing?",0
"Hi there, today I have a very special announcement namely, Ill be attending the Origami USA convention this year, Its going to take place at Manhattan College in Riverdale, NY from June 19 to June 22, 2015 and Im super, super excited Its extra special because its the first convention that Ill be attending outside of Europe so I look forward to seeing a lot of people that I havent met before perhaps you, too and something special too about this convention is that I will be a special guest so I was invited which is a huge, huge honor for me and Ill be teaching lots of workshops and Ill also be joined by Hoang Tien Quyet as the other special guest and hes such an awesome artist I really look forward to meeting him too If you dont know his work yet, he has a Flickr stream and he also has a new YouTube channel so do check that out He has a very artistic way of designing models and its absolutely gorgeous and beautiful So thats really nice, too",1
Hi,1
This is Dan with my review of Groundhog Day by (stutter) Bill Murray,1
This is one of my favorite movies,1
So I would give this a (stutter) enthusiastic five out of five rating,1
"(umm) Groundhog Day is rated PG for (umm) some suggestive scenes and materials, but this is a very funny movie in that it is well-played by Bill Murray and well-written (umm) by far",1
"Groundhog Day (umm) being (ahh) that day in spring in which the groundhog comes out of its hibernation, checks and looks for its shadow",1
"And if he sees it, then we have X more weeks of winter left, something like that",1
"(umm) Billy Murray and his crew, his news crew, are sent to cover (umm) the (umm) emergence of Punxsutawney Phil, yup, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, (uhh) the (stutter) groundhog famous for coming out and looking for its shadow",1
But what Bill Murray finds out is that he is somehow trapped in this day,1
He wakes up,1
"He replays the day over, as if nothing the day before had happened",1
"And, you know, he lives this day over and over and over again",1
"At first, he enjoys it, from robbing banks to doing whatever he wishes, (uhh) until he finally realizes that hes stuck in this little timewarp and even tries to drive off a cliff to kill himself, only to wake up to that same alarm thats been going off day after day after day",1
"The mystery is how he is going to break out of this loop, and thats the fun of the movie",1
"Groundhog Day is a fun one, good for dates, good for significant others",1
"Its, to some degree, a chick flick (uhh) which is, which is (stutter) fun",1
But youll also get a good laugh out of it (umm) in addition to the romance and the drama that does evolve in it,1
"DAVID BELL: Certainly we want to see whats going on, in terms of these conversations, but maybe we want to participate.",1
"But theres also the notion of do I participate in kind of an honest and a real way, or do I participate in a more subversive kind of way.",0
"The danger is if the firm intervenes in the process, if it does it in a way thats too transparent, and people see the firm as an outsider, I think this could be problematic.",0
"If you are running for office, or plan to someday, you will encounter four difficult pressure points in your campaign: the press, interest groups, donors, and voters.",1
How you respond to those pressure points is often the difference between victory and defeat.,1
In a minute I’ll tell you why.,1
"The Press is constantly badgering candidates to talk about things that are important to the media, but not necessary the voters.",0
Which is why we often see candidates being asked about global warming even though very few voters say it is their top concern.,0
"The press will also badger you about things you’d rather not discuss, like when you plan to release your tax returns.",0
If you let reporters throw you off message voters will never hear your message.,0
"Likewise, important interest groups expect candidates to toe the line on their agenda, and are quick to howl when candidates don’t.",0
Need proof?,0
Look at the howling from elements of the conservative religious community about Donald Trump.,1
Or imagine how unionized teachers would react if Hillary Clinton said something nice about charter schools.,1
Don’t hold your breath on that one.,1
Donors exert pressure.,0
"They invest money to buy access and influence, or because of deeply held beliefs.",0
Donald Trump is seeing that first hand now.,0
"Despite his promise to self fund, he now says he can’t foot the bill for a billion dollar campaign.",0
You have recently incorporated your business and you are coming in contact with many terms and phrases that you were not previously familiar with.,0
One of these phrases is the board of directors.,1
Hi,1
This is my review of the movie Music and Lyrics,1
(umm) I rented this the other day from Blockbuster and (umm) my mom described this movie as cheesy to me and basically I would say that sums the movie up like cheesy,0
"Its just one of those really cheesy movies (umm) basically (umm) Hugh Grant is this former like eighties pop star who was really popular in the eighties and (umm) they start doing some battle of the (uhh) like battle of the not bands but that kind of deal, battle of the pop stars from the eighties (umm) to kinda bring back some of the eighties stars and (umm) I guess in the process of that, this like, current (umm) like a Britney Spears or (umm) (umm) that type of person basically (umm) is wanting Hugh Grant to write a song for her (umm) she actually has several like husband artists (umm) kind of competing to write a song for her and so (umm) the only problem is that Hugh Grant is while hes a good singer and everything, hes not the one who always wrote the lyrics to the song, he had someone else in his band do that (umm) but the band, like hes not in speaking terms with the guy who normally write these lyrics so now hes in trouble because he cant write lyrics",0
"(umm) And then enter Drew Barrymore, his (umm) actually apparently, this plant lady, she is hired to take care of his plants (umm) and so she, just happens to be this really awesome writer, she had written childrens story or something like that and so, she (umm) writes, helps him write this song and (umm) of course (uhh) pop star, the current pop star loves it and so, she uses it and blah blah blah and its just really really cheesy",0
"And of course because, you know, like all cheesy movies, these two fall in love, Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant fall in love and its just a cheesy cheesy movie",0
"I really dont recommend it unless youre just looking for a way to waste an hour and a half and then you know , you might like it but (umm) I was pretty disappointed in it, at least I knew going into it was going to be pretty cheesy because my mom had warned me so yeah I wasnt like oh really disappointed but still",0
(umm) So I would give this movie two out of five stars,0

Hi Im Carl Kwan.,1
This is Part 1 in a four part series on presentation design using CRAP.,1
In this video youll learn about contrast.,1
"Contrast, by definition, is an obvious difference between objects.",1
Contrast in your presentation slides is important because it helps your audience identify what is important on your slides and what is less important.,1
Its a process that happens naturally because the human brain processes larger things as more significant and smaller things as less significant.,1
"When it comes to presentations, the easiest way to apply contrast is in your presentation text.",1
Lets have a look at an example.,1
"As you can see, the text is the same size with no contrast whatsoever.",1
Your job as the presenter is to help the audience quickly understand what is important to them and not to make them guess.,1
So here is contrast applied to the most important content on the slide.,1
One experience that will stay with me through my law career is my 1L summer internship with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.,1
During my first week there I was asked to produce a memo to basically decide if the agency was going to pursue a certain case or not.,1
"We also know that gender equality is absolutely critical for, as what the World Bank says, smart economics.",1
"There is an annual report that the World Economic Forum puts out that shows, in countries where men and women are more equal, where the gap is closed on key indicators, including economic participation, that those countries are far more economically competitive and prosperous and there is a wealth of data that shows that as women take their place in the workforce, the enhancement to economic productivity grows rather exponentially.",1
"We also know that women invest their incomes in far greater numbers, upwards to ninety percent, in education and health for their children and into the wider community.",1
"Gday, my name is Rod Sherwin from Tap4Health.",1
Welcome to another EFT Advanced Approaches video.,1
"The basic EFT set up statement is Even though I have this issue - is the first part, focussing on whatever the issue is you want to focus on - and the second bit, I deeply and completely accept myself or I deeply and profoundly accept myself. Now, sometimes were okay saying that negative stuff but when we get to the I deeply and completely accept myself you go, Oh no, I dont.",0
Thats crap.,1
I dont believe that at all! So what can you say when you dont deeply and completely accept yourself?,1
What can you do?,1
"The curious thing is theres been some research done by some other Australians, David Lake and Stephen Wells, that shows it works just as well if you dont say I deeply and completely accept myself and if you just focus on the issue.",1
"So you may want to tap on just, Feeling upset about that fight with my spouse, Feeling upset about that fight with my spouse. Just focus on what the issue is.",1
They did one test which is just remarkable where they changed that second part to I completely reject myself and it still worked.,0
So its all about what you focus on while you tap.,1
It is good to be able to say something positive after youre focusing on the negative.,1
The reason we focus on the negative is so that your energy system is tuned in to the issue that you want to deal with.,1

"this is a quick video to show you how to do the pie chart thats going to work on your profit and loss spreadsheet assignment and pie chart is going to be the components of revenue Revenue is ALL the money that comes into the business Now we want to see all the expenses where it goes That is cost of good sold like the meat for hamburger and salaries and the interest, advertising, Christmas party, Uncle Sam for taxes and then Net Income to shareholders This is how we do it will add slices - numbers and labels on non-contiguous, not touching cells we Step 1, start by clicking on the first cell value of cost of goods sold and then down my control key or Im on a Mac so its called a command key and I click on each of these non operating, also known as discretionary expense since I can spend or not 1, 2 3 then I click on taxes which is the money I have to send to Uncle Sam and this is the money that left for dividends or reinvested in the business for shareholders",1
"finally I highlight those labels still holding down the Ctrl Cost of Good sold, advertising, Christmas party, taxes and income Then I let go of the Ctrl key I go to my pie chart My pictures are different on a Mac I choose a 3D pie and there they are The various components: cost of goods sold advertising, Christmas party taxes, net income",1
"If I wish to explode one of them for example, Im feeling very badly that taxes I will click taxes",1
I will kick on it again so that the dots are just here,1
"we can think about the treated people as a particular subset of people, the people who were treated",1
And we can define the average treatment effect for those people,1
"So the average treatment on the treated, ATT, is just going to be the average unit causal effects for the people who are treated",1
"So this person, this person, this person, thats 20 plus five, plus five and then this person here, this one female who is treated plus five divided by four people",1
"So thats the average treatment on the treated, the average of this three people and this person",1

About 20－thousand nurses from more than one－hundred－30 countries are gathered in Seoul for this year′s International Council of Nurses Conference.,1

"are you talking about yourself, and what youre doing, and why its so awesome for you",1
"Or are you telling the story of your channel thats actually about other people, and what youre doing for them, and how youre serving them",1
"And all of that comes down to what I would define as, what is your mission for your channel",1
And I want you guys to comment below,1
What is your mission for your channel,1
What is your belief that compels you to make videos and to share what youre sharing on YouTube,1
"And by the way, that belief can be a very powerful tool for growing your channels, because the strongest communities-- both online and offline-- they dont revolve around common interest",1
They actually revolve around shared beliefs,1
"And when you share what you believe on your channel, other people who share that belief with you will instantly form a much stronger human connection with you",1
"Youll start getting emotions engaged rather than just like intellect, like, OK, I like this guy because of whatever",1
"Oh, now I feel something",1
"The School of Writing, Rhetoric, and Technical Communication has a one-hour capstone course at the end of the semester where students are expected to take much of what theyve learned, many of the artifacts and projects and work theyve done throughout their major and choose pieces from it to create a portfolio",1
We really prefer a digital portfolio,1
"This course is a way to further professionalize yourself, even though its at the very end, youre bringing together not only all this great work that youve done, but youre bringing together all the relationships and things that youve had with you cohort -- of your classmates",1
All you guys are now in this one class together about to go off and do wonderful things,1
So thats one of the other critical issues that I have with the course: helping them understand that its more than just a class to get through,1
"Its a celebration of things that youve learned, things that youve done to be proud of, and the relationships and camaraderie you had with other students",1
"One of the benefits that the Media Fellow, Alexa, brought to the capstone course -- for me she is just an ideal, model student because she understands that the things that shes bringing into class, her assignments, go beyond simply doing an assignment, beyond getting a grade, beyond staying within the confines of the University",1
She is both student and professional,1
"And as long as Ive known her, and its been three semesters now, thats how shes always been",1
So shes always had this forethought of seeing that this is what Im doing now and this is how it needs to work in the future,1
And I think thats what all students need to bring to this class,1
"Alexa is always there, and students would go up to her first",1
"Before they would go up to any of their own classmates, even before me",1
"She, and I think the idea of the Media Fellow, really is more than a supplement to",1
"Alright, first lets talk about content.",0
"All right, now what we want to talk about is fluency.",1
do talk a little bit about spoilery things,1
"So I will warn you guys before that happens that way if you dont want to be spoiled at all, if you havent read the play yet or havent seen the play yet, you dont have to worry about being spoiled in this video up until a certain point",1
So I will give you guys a heads up when thats going to occur and you guys can close out of the video at that point,0
This is a play thats getting pretty divisive reactions,1
Im just going to talk about my own experience with this play and my opinions on it and this doesnt in any way negate anyone elses opinion,1
"Obviously that goes for like any opinion that I give because, again, theyre all opinions",1
"So I got this book from the library, hence why Im not holding it up right now",1

"Cause its very important, because you dont know, life is short you know!",1

"And ahh, it makes life go, it makes life great, it really really makes it awesome.",1
Ever wonder what the difference is between a real estate buyer’s agent and a transaction broker?,1
"If you’re a buyer, we have in Colorado two types of real estate agency relationships that you can work with.",1
You can choose to work with a transaction broker or with a buyer’s agent.,1
In Colorado it’s a smart idea to make sure you’re hiring a buyer’s agent.,1
A buyer’s agent will work as your personal advocate to guide you through the complicated process of buying a home.,1
They will explain the risks of the transaction and how to negotiate the best deal.,1
A buyer’s agent will also pull comparable sales data and inform you about what other homes have sold for so you can negotiate the lowest price possible on the house you wish to buy.,1
"that tells you the best way to find where to put it in your house, so you can get the most channels",1
"What Im going to do is try this on both of the TVs we have, one in the living room, one in my bedroom, which these antennas are usually with",1
"Ill see how many channels the TV was able to capture with these antennas, and then put this in, and have it run that Find Channel feature and see how many more, or fewer, it finds with this",1
"Here are the channels we get under DTV, Digital TV",1
There are 18 channels all together,1
"Not all of them are very clear, some are pretty staticky",1
"But, this is what its picked up",1
"The TV is in Channel Search mode, and I have put the antenna up on the wall right here, which I taped it, because the suction cups dont stick to the paint and I didnt want to put screws in the wall",1
now I think that you may got some general ideas about different networking certifications,1
that it will be definitely helpful for you,1
Next one is certifications methods,1
in this initially I would like to talk about Cisco career certifications,1
Cisco is an American multi-national technology company,1
Cisco offers five different levels of network certifications,1
"That are, First one is entry",1
"third one is professional, fourth one is expert",1
and fifth one is architects level,1
Thats the top most level,1

"It has subtitles in English and French and it also has not one comedian on it xxx I cant find it but, it has comedian on it but xxx pretty funny on TV a lot",1
"I think the key to innovation is in the stories that we tell each other, and well tell the future.",1

On their way to Iraq in a plane,0
They decide they dont want to sleep on the plane so they go back and sleep in a military jet,0
I mean a military jeep,0
Well sure enough the jeep gets dropped in the middle of the desert some place,1
"They wake up, and they think theyre in Iraq",0
But instead theyre in Mexico,1
So they start a war in Mexico against some rebels,0
"Its dumb, its stupid, its boring",0
"(uhh) A lack of taste, (uhh) what other bad words can I think of",0
"(uhh) Ive never seen a movie like this, I dont want to see another one like it",1
So I think they shouldve dropped the word delta and just went with the farce,0
"Because its not a movie, its a joke",0
I watched Larry the Cable Guy shows and theyve been funny and okay,0
"This is not even that funny, and its not even okay",1
Not gonna even give it an okay rating,1
"And you can see here at position 396, theres variation",1
"some plants have a C, some plants have a T And we think that this position, whether they have a C or a T, determines which Rhizobia they interact with",1
"So while Rhizobia strains can vary in how they treat their host plants, plants are not powerless in this relationship",1
"When faced with the choice of bacterial partners in the soil, plants have genes that can determine which bacteria get into their root nodules, and which ones dont",1
Different plans genotypes choose different bacteria,1
"Here on the left, this plant is interacting with the more beneficial strain, making a good choice",1
"So here on the right, this plant is allowing the less beneficial rhizobia to infect the nodules as well",1
Hi,1
This is Dan with my review of Dogville on DVD,1
Ouch,0
This movie sucked,0
"(umm) If there was a movie that could be any worse than this, Id probably call it a play, which is what basically this was as a movie",0
"(uhh) It earns a hearty one out of five stars in my opinion, even though it stars a (uhh) well known and, I think personally, great actress, Nicole Kidman",0
"I just think the whole setup of Dogville (uhh) just, it was weak",1
"It felt like you were looking at Harry Potters little map, his magic map, with people walking around, and that was the set and that was the whole movie",0
"Yes, we had to actually fast forward this chapter by chapter just to make sure there was never going to be any real scenery or real set to look at",0
Very disappointing,0
"Dogville (umm), you know from the back of the cover seemed to be kind of interesting, but the way that the screenplay and they set it up basically was a stage act with little more than props as furniture and also black backdrops just to sort of see this whole thing play out",0
"(umm) Never got really into the movie (uhh) because it was just so distracting, and not immersive",0
It felt like you were sitting in a theater and (umm) sort of tricked into it,0
Especially since its a movie you know,0
So (umm) Its rated R,0
"I would not recommend it, especially if you thought it was a movie",0
"Well, its not even a movie at that",0
"So Dogville, one out of five stars",0
Hi this is Dan with my review of Eight Legged Freaks on DVD,0
"And I hadnt even heard about this movie until I actually saw it on tv once and I thought man, that is the worst movie Id ever seen what is it",0
And I finally dug it up and discovered Eight Legged Freaks,0
From the producers of Independence Day and Godzilla,0
Independence Day and Godzilla this movie is not,0
"Basically it, (stutter) the prime attraction here is that it stars that Dewey guy from, (uhh) not Scary Movie but (uhh) Scream",1
And he is I think the cop of a town again,0
But the town is basically infested with giant spiders,1
"Hence the name Eight Legged Freaks and the little boy whos a little nerdy and you know, does the science fair thing, (stutter) you know, is all of a sudden the master of all these arachnids that are terrorizing the town",1
"Its like dead rising, the computer game, the video game on Xbox three-sixty with the zombies (uhh) meets (uhh) arachnids, these spiders",0
And (umm) basically theyre all in the mall and these things are attacking and seriously I thought I was playing a video game,1
"Definitely not fun when youre not playing a video game and attacking everything yourself, but watching other people get spun into cocoons, eaten, and (uhh) maybe some of these spiders getting attacked",1
"So, one out of five stars is my opinion of this movie, do not rent it, do not buy it",1
"Its rated PG-thirteen for sci-fi violence, brief sexuality and language",1
But definitely not worth your time,0
Hi,1
(umm) Todays product that Im gonna review is a DVD,1
"Its called Dreamgirls starring Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Hudson, Jamie Foxx, (umm) several other different famous (umm) people",1
"But this {clears throat} is the story about (umm) three girls dreams to become singers and (uhh) it, it (stutter) won (umm) some Academy Awards I dont like this movie",0
"(umm) Theres a lot of singing in it, which isnt bad, I love musicals",1
But (umm) just the whole story line was I I (stutter) didnt care for it,0
"(umm) It was about Jamie Foxx of course played sort of a bad guy who (umm), you know, used kind of used (stutter) the girls against one another to get rich and (umm) get popular",1
And I I (stutter) just didnt care for the movie,0
The whole plot line was (umm) just silly and stupid,0
Hi (umm) today the product that Im going to review is a DVD,1
Its called I Love You,1
Dont Touch Me! (umm) This is a story about a young woman (umm) is probably based in the 1990s or something,0
But its a story of a young woman (uhh) whos twenty-five who is (umm) basically in love with love and shes trying to find mister right,0
But (umm) its kind of a boring movie,0
"(umm) I just watched it to find out if she happens to get together with her (umm) best friend, who is who is (stutter) a guy (umm) whos in love with her",1
"But she has (umm) no feelings for him, no feelings of love for him in the beginning",1
And she (umm) the story focuses a lot on (umm) intimacies,0
{laughter} Between men and women,1
(umm) A little bit too much,0
"She uses, is a lot of foul language in this movie",1
This is Blade,1
This movie is starring Wesley Snipes,1
Its about a man that is a vampire pretty much,1
"And hes not what you consider one of them I dont know, full vampires",0
Because he dont go around drinking people blood,0
Matter of fact he go around fighting actual vampires,0
He is not getting his blood from sucking peoples necks and all that stuff and killing folks or whatever you do,1
Whatever they do,0
He actually gets his from a little he he (stutter) got some kind of special stuff that he use,0
So he dont have to do all that,1
"And he has, he meets this girl that is kind of I dont know, taking an interest to his life a little",1
And (stutter) trying to figure out what the deal is,0
"What up guys, this is Cade and Im doing a review of the Blade Trinity",1
"This is the third (umm) installment in the Blade series, the movie is the final one, and this is the special unrated version",1
With the unrated version what you get is pretty much as it says on the back ten more minutes of action,1
"So you got an extra fight scene right there, its really long and probably just a couple of slow motion stuff going on so not exactly the best extra",0
"But yeah, also the movie itself isnt very good",0
"Its pretty much, you know, (stutter) Wesley Snipes playing the vampire hunter Blade and its from the Ghost Rider comic books",0
"And he hunts for vampires and instead in this one hes joined by these people, theres more people in the team but these are the main ones that were focused upon and they just go around killing vampires",0
"This one didnt have sort of the dark feeling that the first two (umm) Blade films have, its more just like action oriented",0
I felt like I was watching Triple X or something like that so its not exactly very high on my list of action films,0
"So overall I give (umm) Blade Trinity a two because its a little entertaining, but man, overall its definitely not as good as the first two by any means",0
"Hey guys, this is Tay here and Im going to review the very unexciting movie Stigmata",0
(uhh) This (umm) you can call it pretty much an exorcism movie,1
"Youve got (uhh) Patricia Arquette I believe, yes, and she (umm) plays this woman right here who gets a little possessed in the movie",0
"Shes a hairdresser then she, you know, like I said gets possessed and you got all these crazy satanic shenanigans going on",1
"(umm) The plot if you ask me is kind of hollow, theres not that much going on",1
"Youve got like the typical priest guy thats trying to help her out and so forth and he gets caught up in all this stuff, maybe even falls in love with her or something like that",0
"Its this thing, you know I dont really want to go beyond that in (uhh) describing this plot of the stigmata its just like when you get like living wounds of like the same stuff that Christ had",1
"So you get like hanging from the arm and the feet and so forth and that she gets to start out with, and thats what begins the possession",1
"(umm) This right here has got some special features including (umm) an alternate ending which is pretty interesting, we were watching that",1
Audio commentary from the director and deleted scenes and also a music video by Natalie Imbruglia,1
"So, see now I didnt like this movie that much, I gave it two out of five stars, so if you like this movie its a pretty good DVD to get because you got a lot of special features",1
"You know in the English language there are many different clauses, independent clauses, dependent clauses.",1
"Hi, Im Paige Carrera and today were going to talk about independent clauses.",1
Pretty easy if you think about it.,1
Independent clause is basically a clause that can stand on its own.,1
"A subject, a verb, doesnt even have to have an object really, but thats pretty much what it is.",0
"Directed by Ron Howard, Backdraft stars (uhh) Kurt Russel and William Baldwin as two Chicago Firefighters out to stop an arsonist",1
(umm) Has a good strong supporting cast including Donald Sutherland and Robert De Niro,1
"However, Its aged quite a bit and for a murder, thriller, drama starring firefighters its not all that great of a movie",1
"(umm) For one thing it has William Baldwin, one of the worst of the Baldwin brothers",0
"(umm) In its some interesting use of fire, particularly the whole concept of back draft, which a lot of people dont really know about",0
"(umm) Starts in Chicago which is my favorite city, which gotta give props for that, that they dont use New York or Los Angeles",0
"Go for something a little grittier, get the (uhh) audience",0
Of course its filmed in the nineties otherwise they wouldve probably used New York for the firefighters,0
(umm) The movie has very few (uhh) additional features on it,1
(umm) just captions and subtitles,1
"Its widescreen, yes widescreen see",0
"If you get this for five bucks, I guess it would be okay to get",1
(umm) Its really not worth watching though,0
"Directed by Ron Howard and he does a good job usually, but not with this",0
"You are looking at Absorb Healths DIM or Di-indolyl-methane Described on the official Dr. Oz blog as a superantioxidant to help prevent chronic diseases, DIM is a cruciferous vegetable extract that promotes healthy hormonal balance by lessening the effects of excess estrogen.",1
Im here to talk about this movie (uhh) Lost in Translation,1
It stars Bill Murray and (uhh) it runs for an hour and forty-two minutes and its rated R,1
This has (uhh) been out for a little while and (umm) I didnt really like this movie,0
"It was really slow, it was boring, (uhh) the story line didnt make any sense at all",0
"Its about some (uhh) TV personality, I guess thats what he was, that (uhh) went to Japan for to to (stutter) do some promotions and (umm) things he did there, the girl he met and all this kind of thing but I just really didnt enjoy this and I I (stutter) just didnt understand what the story was about and this {sigh}",0
"(umm) I dont I dont (stutter) know, you might like this, you might not, but I just didnt really think, you know, I dont think it was up to Bill Murrays standards but (umm) try it, you might think differently",0
"Hi this is a movie that stars Kurt Russell and its called Dark Blue, and (uhh) (umm) Kurt Russell kind of played, he plays a L",1
police (uhh) guy and (uhh) hes a mean guy,1
And (umm) he has a new (uhh) rookie that goes with him and (umm) he sort of teaches him the ropes,0
"But in this movie, (umm) Kurt Russell he plays a kind of a bad character the cop is kind of mean",1
"And (umm) but hes kind of showing the other guy the ropes, so",0
"I I (stutter) didnt care for the movie because of the, I didnt like the storyline, and (uhh) at the end I think (uhh) you know it (stutter) at, the Rodney King (uhh) riot breaks out in the movie",0
"Hi, Im gonna review a movie in theaters now and this movies called Knocked Up and it stars Katherine Heigl and some other (uhh) cast members and I was really disappointed with the with the (stutter) movie and felt you know, I got short changed",0
I wanted to go back to the manager and ask for my money back (uhh) cause this movie is really bad,0
Now it is rated R for sexual content and language and drugs and it had all three of those and the drugs it had too much and just totally unnecessary,0
(uhh) (uhh) shots about drugs or scenes with drugs in it and the language in it was horrible,1
It was bad,0
(uhh) Really gross language,0
So you definitely dont wanna take your children to this movie,0
In fact I wouldnt wouldnt (stutter) recommend the movie to anybody unless youre over a hundred,0
(uhh) Even then (uhh) Its probably not a good movie to watch,0
"But I was totally (uhh) totally (uhh) turned off by the movie and you notice that, or we notice that in the trailers that they put out on the movie, you know they only showed the funny shots",1
"Had they put out the bad language shot, I dont think as many people would go to see the movie",0
But (stutters) Katherine was the only (umm) actress in there that did a credible job of acting,0
All of the other actors were terrible,0
(uhh) They just werent good actors,0
The script was bad and its just totally a gross movie,0
I wouldnt recommend it,0
(uhh) (uhh) Wouldnt recommend this movie to anybody,0
In fact (uhh) I would give it an award,0
"It was, this is the worse movie in ten years award is what I would give the movie",0
"(uhh) So again, the movie is Knocked Up",0
Advertisers face a number of challenges in measuring online impact to media.,0
Some of those challenges I would submit are somewhat self created.,1
"Or Im feeling really tired, I feel like I need some protein, so Im gonna get some yogurt",1
"It just takes a lot of practice, and theres some websites you can look at for mindful eating",1
Just kinda starting to listen to what my body needs,1
So let me kinda describe what my life looks like now,1
I can actually like hold a bag of pretzels,0
zero temptation to eat this right now,1
"For me, thats a miracle",1
"I dont feel guilty for what I eat, almost ever",1
"I feel like I eat when Im hungry, and I stop when Im not hungry anymore",1
And food doesnt control my thoughts anymore,1
Im not thinking about it all day long every day,1
"I enjoy the food that Im eating, and if I dont like it, then I dont really eat it",1
"unless if its something thats really good for me, and then I make myself eat it anyway -- usually",1

So its a really great site.,1
Now were going to discuss the types of customer service.,1
Im Pamela Unruh on behalf of Expert Village.,1
"When you are dealing with a customer at home sometimes, youre going to have to put that customer on hold.",0
"We all hate to be put on hold, everybody does.",1
"So when you are putting a customer on hold, how to put yourself in their shoes a little bit.",1
"I got a question recently from a viewer and its, Which is better to take? A big job in a little company or a small job in a big company? Great question",1
"I love that, from a career development standpoint",1
It really depends on your tolerance for risk and how much you want to take control over your career moving forward,1
Theres positives and negatives to both sides of things,1
A big job in a smaller company usually gives you more experience,1
"Youre exposed to different things because things arent as segmented as they are in larger companies, but your advancement rests on the ability of the organization to grow, or you to create a job for yourself moving forward, or for you to find a job in another small company",1
You have to take a little bit more of your own career development on yourself in those smaller companies,1
Taking a small job,1
"and it can be a similar job, but in a larger organization, it is a smaller job, gives you more of a clear path forward",1
You have the safety of a large organization that is going to have opportunities for you to grow,1
"Whether it is within your own department moving up, or whether it is in a neighboring department moving up",1
"What you are is youre constrained in your development and that path can be slow, depending on the growth of the organization and just the mindset of the organization moving forward",1
"Truthfully, to get right down to it, I recommend bouncing between the two",1
I think its a great opportunity for you to have the security and the understanding of how a large organization works,1
"Dont get me wrong, both of these organizations, small and large, value the experience from the other side",1
"Small companies love that you worked for a large company and you can help them, you can move procedures and everything else in the culture of a large company, because all small companies usually want to be larger",1
The large companies love the broad-based experience that you had in a smaller company,1
"A lot of times what can happen is, is you can move up the ladder by bouncing between the ladders, and you can actually do that faster than if you just move up one particular type of ladder",1
What is narrative style in literature?,0
"It is not to be confused with prose style which is a choice of words but narrative style is the choice of who is going to be the narrator, who is going to tell the story?",0
"We have three basic modes, first person, second person, third person, just like our favorite pronouns.",1
"First person I tell the story, it is happening about me.",1
"In the second person not used very often, you read the story and you are the protagonist.",1
"Hello my name is James, president JM Equity Recovery LLC",1
"We are located in Deer Park, NY on Long Island and I am coming to you with the question of the day",1
"The question of the day is: James, how can I sell my house quickly and still get full retail value? Now thats a great question",1
Ive just written a blog post about this and if you want all the details you can click on the link below and go right to my blog post get all the details,0
"I am going to summarize it on this video very quickly, and break down to some brief points",0
Point number one is: Clean Clean and Clean some more,1
"Even vacant houses they get dirty, they get dusty",0
"Consider hiring somebody, make it look immaculate",1
"Number two, cultivate a cohesive and neutral style",1
Everything has to work together light colors,1
Maybe a pale yellow in the kitchen to brighten things up,1
"Number three, fix or replace an anything thats broken",1
"The buyer sees that as a sign of weakness, and they jump on that and they try to negotiate, and you lose money, most likely more money than it would have taken to replace the item",1
"Number four, Make any necessary improvements",1
"Anything that is necessary, but dont over improve!! Thats one of the biggest problems that people do",1
"The put in too much money, and they wind up losing in the end",1
The only real safe investment unfortunately is paint,1
Paint usually works the best,0
So to consider that,1
"Number 5, get expert opinions about pricing",1
Pricing your house is the key to a quick sale,1
If youre too too high you are just going to sit on the market,1
"Number 6, have a great marketing plan",1
A great marketing plan is a tough one,1
It is sometimes expensive and time-consuming so I recommend educating yourself about all the finer points of marketing a home,1
Again it takes time Or number 7 is get a cash offer,1
Getting a cash offer is what we do here at JM Equity Recovery LLC,1
"We will do all the work for you, so you dont have lift a finger",1
The house is totally AS IS condition,1
We buy it just like that,1
"Or even if you have the time or all the money you need to do the repairs in the marketing plan, you might not have the time",1
Typically a sale with real estate takes three to nine months on Long Island,1
Its an attorney state,1
things do take time,1
So when we buy your house at JM Equity Recovery LLC we pay cash no banks involved,0
The process moves along very very quickly,1
"We can close in as little as 10 days, so that can eliminate a lot of the waiting around and the aggravation that goes along with the points i just mentioned",1
So I hope that answers your question If you have any other questions check out my blog first,1
"Hi, Im Rachel Woodburn and I teach Digital Storytelling at Scottsdale Community College Its one of my favorite classes to teach",1
The focus of that class is personal narrative,1
"I had the privilege of, over a decade ago, not only attending a workshop from the center for digital storytelling in Berkeley, CA",1
when it came to Maricopa,1
But then Joe was in the class and Linda Hicks was there and we started that class together because we wanted all of our students to experience what we had experienced,1
"And Im Joe Ortiz, and Ive been teaching this digital storytelling class for two years now",1
"I took over for Linda Hicks, who retired, and Ive thoroughly enjoyed teaching the class with Rachel",1
"Ive learned a great deal more about the technique of digital storytelling, particularly from a design and artistic standpoint",1
Number 5 – Appear To Be Open-Minded Becoming defensive is one of the worst ways to win an argument,1
Don’t let your opponent sense that you’re digging into your position without being willing to consider alternatives,0
"If you appear to be giving the other side’s position a thoughtful review, then the solution you propose will seem far more sensible",1
"Additionally, your opponent may come to your side, without you having to do anything other than listen",1
"By letting your opponent speak, the situation may resolve itself naturally",1
"Number 6 - Stick To The Subject When someone begins to lose an argument, it’s quite common to see them try to divert the topic to something else – with the hopes that you won’t notice their weakness",1
"When this happens, don’t fall for it",1
Return to the original topic immediately,1
People get nervous before they make presentations.,1
People hear that they have to make a presentation and they freeze.,1
I know that I’ve shared bits and pieces,1
"And for the last two or three weeks, the Lord has been taking me back and walking me through another situation that happened to me that I thought I had completely healed from",1
But God is so awesome and that he would take you back when you’re ready and just bring even deeper healing to your spirit and to your mind and to your body,1
And he will teach us through our past,1
"He will teach us through experiences that we went through, not that he brought on this experience",1

"Today is November 9th, 2016 but by the time you guys see this, itll have been exactly a week since the US election",0
And six days since we knew what the results were,1
"Today I was going to do some upbeat writing vlog, um, like I tend to do even though I hadnt decided what the topic was yet",1
But when I saw the news this morning I knew I wasnt going to be able to do that,1
"Im going to be honest, you guys, Im hurting",1
"Ive decided Im going to allow myself to feel this today, and then tomorrow Im going to start fighting",0
But the way Im going to fight is through writing because writing is a political act,0
"I drafted INTO THE BLACK, which is BEYOND THE REDs sequel, over the summer",0
INTO THE BLACK is a very political book,1
"I dont think I fully realized just how much the politics in INTO THE BLACK match up with our politics today until I was going through reader notes, but they do",1
When I was first drafting INTO THE BLACK I had a lot of hope for where this election would go,0
"I was nervous, too, and scared about what could happen, but I truly believed that we had a really good chance to embrace a message of progressing forward, and embracing one another, and loving each other, and trying—trying to see each other as equals more than we do right now",0
[sighs] But thats not where it ended,0
In a way Im glad I drafted it over the summer because Im not sure how much hopefulness I wouldve been able to put into this manuscript had I known where we were going to end,0
"So, yeah, right now Im letting myself feel this pain, and this anger, and this betrayal, and [sighs] this fear, and everything else, and Im going to remember it when Im revising",1
But Im not going to let it break me,0
Im going to fight harder,0
Writing diverse worlds where love wins and equality is central is a political act,1
"Just as writing monolithic worlds where one group holds power over the other and uses it to oppress the other, or uses it to pretend that the other doesnt exist at all, is also a political act",1
And its one of the politics that won today,0
"I want you to know whatever youre writing, whether its diverse or not, its political",0
"I want you to know that even if you dont physically have politics in your book like I do, its political",0
"I want you to know that how you choose to create the world of your book, whether it reflects our reality, or whether it chooses to pretend that much of our world doesnt exist and erases them out of the narrative completely, its political",1

Hi,1
(umm) Todays product that Im going to review is the DVD Bewitched starring Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell,0
I didnt care for this movie {laugh},1
"(umm) I give it probably a two, a rating of two",0
And the reason I didnt like it is because Will Ferrell plays an actor who is going to be doing a new and improved version of Bewitched and then (umm) Nicole Kidman plays a real life witch who comes down to earth to live and then ended up being cast in the role of Samantha on Bewitched,0
Its just a really corny movie,0
(umm) I hate the way that they did that,0
"Pretending that (umm), you know, there were two people and then they were gonna start playing the actors Samantha and Darren so its really not about Bewitched",0
(umm) Its more about this girl whos a witch who plays Samantha,0
But as I said I dont really care for it,1
I mean its about two hours long,0
Hi,1
(umm) today the product that Im going to review is a DVD,1
"This is Cold Mountain starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger",0
"This was the winner of the academy award (umm) best supporting actress, Renee Zellweger",0
I hated this movie,1
"{laughter} (umm) I give it probably two stars just because of the actors that are in it, I like them",0
{laughter} But if they didnt have those actors I would give it a one,1
"The story is about (umm) the civil war and how this town, I believe its called, (uhh) its Cold Mountain (umm) in North Carolina",1
And (umm) the men of Cold Mountain decide to go and join the the (stutter) war,0
(umm) the story is mainly about Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger as they try to survive through the war and wait for their loved ones to come back,0
Its xxx a stupid film,0
I hate it,1
Nicole Kidman kind of goes cuckoo during the movie,1
(umm) {laughter} theres battle scenes and its its (stutter) not a movie that I like,1
"Hey, take it easy",1
This is Nacho Libre starring one Jack Black and a pair of tights,1
"(uhh) The storys about Jack Black, that guy right there",1
He works in a (uhh) monastery,1
Im not sure the technical term but hes hes a (stutter) practically a priest,0
"By night he raises money by fighting as a, a (stutter) luchador",1
Which is a hispanic wrestler,0
"Now Im not a human, Spanish, luchador, wrestling dictionary but Im, thats pretty sure what I mean, what it means",0
(umm) The comedy leaves you wanting a little more,1
"Its kinda weird, its you wanna laugh but you dont",1
Theres some good parts,1
Jack Black has a mustache,1
Personally I gave it one and a half stars out of five,1
(uhh) It looks nice,1
"The comedys in the same vein Id say, as the directors previous film Napoleon Dynamite but its just not all there unfortunately",1
Which is kinda sad cause I was really hyped up about this movie,0
I didnt watch it until I bought it,0
"Alright, this is (uhh) not a bad pickup for a bargain movie",1
"Its called The Wrong Guy, starring (uhh) David Foley of Kids in the Hall fame, that Canadian sketch show and Jennifer Tilly who was in, I believe, Bride of Chucky and a bunch of other films but thats the only one that comes to mind cause theyre not exactly the greatest actors and actresses in the world",0
"David Foley was also the voice in the Pixar film A Bugs Life which is one of my favorite films, but unfortunately some people dont view it as the best, one of the best (stutter) better Pixar films, but {snort} what do they know? Anyways this is (uhh) its a comedy",1
I think its a direct to DVD comedy,1
(uhh) It has some funny jokes in it that are alright,1
I give it two out five stars,0
If you see it on like (uhh) (umm) TV or something like that Id say watch it,1
"(umm) David Foley is pretty funny, the rest of the cast kind of (uhh)",0
"Otherwise two out of five stars as I said before and (uhh) hes accused of a murder, well he thinks hes accused of a murder that he didnt commit and its basically him as a fugitive running away from people that arent trying to chase him, although he does find the real killer",0
"Keanu Reeves has risen to be one of the (uhh) most popular (uhh) action stars of pretty much in the last, probably a decade",1
"(uhh) He however did get started making (uhh) oh, rather bad films",0
Point Break is one of his worst,0
"{hmm}, Point Break he plays this, a young FBI agent that (uhh) pretty much goes on (uhh) or starts with a company and has a partner, Gary Busey, who is a little bit more (uhh) experienced",1
He gives undercover and becomes a surfer and someone whos generally addicted to extreme sports,1
"He meets up with (uhh) Patrick Swayze, which (stutter) the is known as the worlds most shirtless man",1
"(umm) They (uhh) work together yeah, to uncover, Busey and Keanu Reeves work together to uncover (uhh) a string of bank robberies that are portrayed (uhh) (stutter) that are done by the (uhh) surfer gang that Keanu Reeves joins",1
"(umm) Theres also skydiving, (umm) bad acting, and in general just mayhem",0
"Curtis here with the new (uhh) the new Hannibal movie, Hannibal Rising",1
Now this is a blockbuster exclusive I guess,1
Apparently a straight to DVD rental,0
(uhh) So {cough} you can find it at any Blockbuster,0
"(uhh) I was expecting something a little more gory, maybe a little more horror-ish",1
"But it was really really like (stutter) timid and (uhh) pretty, pretty (uhh) pretty low, I dont know low budget but not really I dont know",1
"Hannibal (uhh) Hannibal Lecter wasnt really, he was played as a character that was like a teenager and he, he (stutter) was kind of like progressing into his cannibalistic stage of the other movies",0
"(uhh) I wouldnt really recommended it if, recommend it (stutter) if you wanna like watch a Hannibal movie Id recommend just going to see like Silence of the Lambs or (uhh) Hannibal, the other Hannibal movies",0
"Which are okay, theyre not, theyre not (stutter) that great either",0
But (uhh) I dont know Id recommend it if you want,0
"(stutter) If you wanna see a movie that takes before Hannibal I recommend it but if you like the Hannibal movies and you dont wanna ruin it, dont see this movie cuz it will probably ruin it and (uhh) you probably wont like Hannibal anymore cuz hes I dont know",0
"Really, really weakling in this movie, okay, alright, thats my review",0
Hi,1
This movie (umm) review is about the two-thousand seven movie called Allegro,1
"(umm) Its basically kind of confusing movie and if I had to give it a grade, it would probably be like (uhh) a scale on one to ten it would probably be a five or a six",0
(umm) The piano playing in the film music were pretty much exciting (umm) and excellent,1
(umm) This story is really complicated to follow,0
"(umm) It was just hard to go along with the whole movie because (umm) because of the fantasy portion it was it was (stutter) related to the zone and (uhh) basically some people like me cannot follow it, and it was just kind of boring and confusing",0
(umm) I dont know it was basically not a movie from mainstream and (uhh) basically it was just kind of a really confusing and boring movie like I said and its not worth paying your money for in my opinion if its even out in your theaters,0
Its really not a great movie,0
Im here to review this dvd,1
And its called Sixteen Candles,1
"It stars Molly Ringwald, and (uhh) its been out for, for quite awhile, so (uhh), you know you may have to look a little harder to find it if you want to see this",0
(uhh) I was very disappointed in this because its rated PG,0
"Now that has to be a typo, because theres (uhh) a lot of bad language, and theres nudity in this movie",0
"And (uhh) I would be really, really careful in watching your kids, (uhh) letting your kids see this because its not appropriate",0
"And its, thats my recommendation this this (stutter) is not appropriate for for (stutter) young kids to see",0
"It (uhh) I believe its even been on tv but Im sure they had to delete those scenes but if you watch this movie, those things are in there and (uhh) for little kids, this movie is deceptive because it looks like its, you know, its for (uhh) teenagers or whatever, but (umm) I I (stutter) just was greatly disappointed in this, but (uhh) I dont, I dont (stutter) (uhh) suggest you watch this at all",0
"I mean if you want to check it out if youre curious after what I said, thats thats (stutter) up to you but (uhh) I dont understand why it says PG on the back when all that stuff is in there, so",0
Hi my name is xxx and today I will xxx the movie for you Kickin It Old School which is going to be playing in theaters,1
Kickin It Old School is (uhh) movie about a kid who is very interested in break dancing and (uhh) given in his childhood days he gets into an accident and while break dancing itself and he goes into a coma for twenty years,0
(umm) He wakes up twenty years later and (uhh) he finds out that hes still kid but with that and also he xxx that dream of making it big in breaking dance in the break dance industry so he regroups his friends and they enter a competition (umm) and (umm) the movie goes on from there there is also this girl who is who is so interested in him (uhh) (umm) same thing I mean (uhh) the rivals from his childhood is again the same rival and (uhh) the whole movie is about how he win the xxx and how he wins the whole competition so the I mean the plot plot (stutter) sounds just okay but the movie is utterly disappointing I mean I did not really enjoy the movie a lot basically because of (umm) the fact that you know xxx that the guy as a kid and (uhh) I mean none of the guys did an exceptional jobs so ended up very disappointed with the movie I do not recommend you watch the trailers I dont even recommend you watch it because (uhh) I actually just rated (umm) two out of five so thats all,0
"Hey ExpoTV, how are you doing today? Im going to review one of my favorite movies of all time, this is Heat",1
"It is a Michael Mann film, and it has two of the greatest actors of all time playing on the (uhh) same movie: Al Pacino and Robert De Niro",1
"This is your average cops-and-robbers film, but its not so average",1
"I believe its one of the best, if not the best, cops-and-robbers good guy-bad buy film of all time",1
Al Pacino plays a detective and Robert De Niro plays the (uhh) bad guy who is doing all these heists,1
"And it is a great movie, a little long, three hours, but it definitely packs a punch",1
Supporting cast is great,1
"You have Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman",1
Dennis Haysbert makes a small role in here,1
You all know him from the Allstate commercials and for being the ex-president on twenty four,1
"Overall, I would give this movie a five out of five",1
Definitely watch this movie multiple times,1
I was first brought to this movie when I was at film camp from North Carolina School of the Arts,1
We were supposed to watch Bridge on the River Kwai,1
Our TA instead let us show Heat,1
Im glad he did,1
This is one of my all-time favorite movies,1
And this right here is the two-disc special edition,1
It came out about two years ago in two thousand five,1
ten years after the movie was released in theaters,1
And you get a lot of special features on the movie,1
"You have eleven additional scenes, five new making documentaries",1
"(uhh) They were, they go back to L",1
There (stutter) are shooting locations,1
"It talks about the script, how it was developed, how it became Heat",1
"And basically, it actually has Al Pacino and De Niro",1
Theres a famous scene where they meet in the coffee shop,1
"A lot of rumors swirling around the Internet that Pacino and De Niro were there on different days, they were not actually there filming at the same time",1
"But, believe it or not, that rumor is actually dispelled",1
"They were, believe it or not, Pacino and De Niro, rivals, together in one scene at the same time",1
Definitely a great film,1
"If you have not seen this, I highly recommend this",1
"A lot for the guys, definitely want to pick this up",1
Great action film,1
Great heist scene,1
Im sure you all remember Dane Cook talking about this,1
{noise} Wheres the van? {noise} you know in his comedy thing,1
"Now the first thing that we have to talk about when were preparing to be conversational in our style when were giving a speech, is enthusiasm and passion.",1
"And what this means, enthusiasm is pretty obvious.",0
"Hi, my name is Jordan and Im gonna be reviewing the movie the DVD, Gladiator",1
Now this movie came out (uhh) a while back and before I saw it I really thought it was just gonna be a straight gore (uhh) flick,0
"I thought it was just gonna have lots of (umm) lots of blood, lots of violence and thats all it was gonna be about",1
Well it turns out this movies actually really really good,1
"It has a great storyline, the actors were great, there was nothing bad about this movie",1
I enjoyed every bit of it,1
"Sometimes it can be a little bit long, but (umm) it really was a great movie",1
It has (umm) lots of action sequences in it,1
It does have a lot of blood and gore and stuff but it also has a great storyline,1
So (umm) Ridley Scott (umm) directed this movie and he did a great job,1
Everything in this movie is great,1
I would recommend it to anyone who likes action movies who doesnt mind seeing a little blood and gore and things like that,1
"But (umm) it has a great story, it even has a little bit of a love story for you know, the ladies",1
So (umm) yep,1
"Hey expo tv Im Dea and as a rule I love superhero movies, Ive said that before",1
"(umm) I love everything about them, the cheese factor, the action sequences, the whole thing",1
"However there are there are (stutter) some of, some exceptions to that rule",1
As to all rules,0
(umm) One of the exceptions to my rule is Daredevil,1
This is very likely one of the worst {laugh} movies of all time,1
"Okay, Im not saying this out of hatred or to be stylish",0
But Ben Affleck is seriously a black hole of talent,1
"Because no matter how many awesome people you put in a movie, Ben Affleck can suck any good out of it",1
Its true,0
There are a couple movies that Ben Affleck is in that I I (stutter) actually like,0
"And I dont personally, I dont have like a vendetta against him, I dont hate him or anything",0
"I, hes not one of those people like, if hes in a movie I refuse to watch it",1
There are a couple of those people,1
"But it just seems like anytime Ben Afflecks in a movie, its just bad",1
Anytime like post the nineties at least,1
(umm) I mean a ton of really cool people are in here,0
"Jennifer Garner plays Elektra Nacho, or as we like to call her, electric nachos",1
"(umm) She, as cool as Jennifer Garner is, and as hot as she looks in all this leather, she still cannot fight the sucktasticism that is Ben Affleck",1
Its sad,0
(umm) Michael Clark Duncan is in here and we all know hes stone cold cool,0
And so is Colin Farrell,0
"And like, I like Colin Farrell",0
But this movies just not good and I highly suspect that its because of the Ben Affleck,1
Hey ExpoTV Im Dea and something that Ive mentioned so many times in so many different videos is that I love superhero movies,1
"And I just like the cheese factor, the cheesier the better",1
Thats how much I love them Im like a big fan,0
"(umm) And Ive also mentioned that I do very few negative reviews, alas this is one of those and whats even worse is that it is about a superhero movie",1
(umm) This right here is Hulk,0
"Okay, heres something that I have to tell you",1
"I will usually stick it out no matter what like, if Im reading a book that I dont care for, Ill finish reading it anyway just to get to the end and you know have an actual educated view of it",1
"If Im watching a movie Ill stick it out until the end because you know, I want to see what happens maybe it redeems itself",0
"This movie was so bad that I couldnt you know, I tried watching it to the end and I was like this is awful on a level that I have previously not experienced in my existence",1
"I mean like, like Shazam with Shaquille ONeal awful",0
"So as a person who like, you know I know a lot of people who are like, I dont, I dont (stutter) dig the superhero movies, theyre too corny for me",0
&gt;&gt;James Schiro - Davos Debates 2009 (Environment) Hi YouTube.,1
Im Jim Schiro the CEO of Zurich Financial Services.,1
About three weeks ago we announced a significant climate change initiative at Zurich.,1
Hi my name is Nalin and today I will be reviewing for you the movie Cant Hardly Wait,1
"(umm) Cant Hardly Wait is a movie which starts out as a, in a, in a (stutter) high school graduation ceremony kind of a setting and (uhh) it starts out as everybody is discussing in the, in the (stutter) (uhh) ceremony that (uhh) Amanda was (uhh) dumped by a man named Mike Dexter",1
So Amanda is actually the homecoming queen and (uhh) Mike Dexter is the homecoming king,0
And (uhh) they were like the hot couple of the high school for four years and (uhh) thats where the whole hype about their breakup,0
"So then it starts out that the guy, theres a guy who likes (uhh) the girl Amanda",0
(uhh) Who is the prom queen,0
So that guy other prom queen Amanda is played by Jennifer Love Hewitt and (uhh) the other guy who likes her a lot is played by Ethan Ambrey,1
"(uhh) The movie on the whole is very average, I mean (uhh) there were very, very boring parts in the whole movie",1
Not very exciting stuff,1
"(uhh) Not too much humor, very predictable and you can actually just figure out whats gonna happen in the end",0
So its a very boring movie I would just rate it one out of five,1
(uhh) A special mention about (uhh) Ethan Ambreys acting in the movie,1
It is horrible,0
"(uhh) I mean I dont know what other kind of expressions hes given but he looks at I mean, many times he just looks like hes having (uhh) stomach problems so his acting is just horrible",0
"But from that Jennifer Love Hewitt is the main reason I got the DVD to watch and (uhh) shes looking cute and (uhh) shes looking pretty good, so",0
"Hi, Im back and Im going to be giving a review of a movie I did not like, Oceans Twelve",1
"Now I loved Oceans Eleven, it was just a great movie and it had all these great actors in it and it was just a lot of fun, but Oceans Twelve seems like it was really stretching to you know, find a plot to find some action, just all around to find some entertainment",0
I just wouldnt recommend it,0
"I mean its got George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Matt all those people",1
(umm) But none of em were just very good in this movie,1
"I mean, they theyre (stutter) good actors, its just a boring movie",1
Now the plot of this movie is that they (umm) are actually I believe in Europe,0
"Yeah theyre in, its been awhile since Ive seen it, they are in Europe and looking to find a safe and it just, you know I honestly dont even remember that much but I was just falling asleep during the movie, it just wasnt good",0
"Now they seem to have (uhh) redeemed themselves in Oceans Thirteen, which is actually out in theaters right now",0
I just saw that and thats a fantastic movie,1
So dont write off the entire series just because this one movie is bad,0
But it is,1
"If you havent seen Oceans Eleven, go see it",0
Its amazing,0
"Skip Oceans Twelve, go see Oceans Thirteen",1
"So, I would give this movie, a two out of five",0
It was just it was just weak and it was not something that I really liked that much,1
"Yeah alright, well, have a good night",1
"Well, that-- it may be readjusting how the-- what their marketing message is.",1
"This is Dustin and today Im reviewing The Good Shepherd, with Robert De Niro, Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie",1
"Its a story about when the CIA basically came into effect and how it came into effect and some of the major events that led to this, mostly dealing with the Cuban missile crisis and the Cold War",1
(umm) Basically in this movie Matt Damon is a CIA agent and it goes through the effects that it has on his life of how secretive it is and everything and (umm) having to keep the secrets even from his family and how this ruins his family life basically and (umm) about how the US government is corrupt (uhh) in a way and and (stutter) (uhh) interfere with other countrys affairs and everything,1
Overall this movie wasnt very good,0
It lacked action,0
I mean it had a story but it was very (uhh) drawn out,0
The movie is two hours and forty minutes,1
"The movie Im reviewing is The Ex, and its in movie theaters now and it stars (umm) Zach Braff and Amanda Peet",1
And basically its just (umm) the two of them are husband and wife and the storys just about (umm) him losing his job and they go to live with her parents and then he works for her dad,0
"And (umm) The one guy that he works with was involved with Amanda Peet (umm) before, and so hes the ex",1
(umm) But its supposed to be a comedy and it really wasnt all that funny,0
(umm) I had somebody when I watched the movie (umm) near us who was just laughing obnoxiously at everything so that also kind of made it a little weird,0
But (umm) it just like I said it wasnt really too funny and the story line wasnt really all that great either,0
"so (umm) if youre looking to just go see any kind of movie, (umm) you could go see it but its not one I would really recommend",0
And I probably wouldnt recommend (uhh) renting it either when it comes out on DVD so,0
Here we have Stealth,1
"This movie was pretty predictable, and, not that entertaining",0
"I mean, it has all the big names in it that youve heard before",0
"(umm) Josh Lucas, Jessica Beil, and Jamie Foxx",0
"However, I dont know, it just lacked a lot of good, in the movie",0
I (stutter) without a better word good,0
"(umm), I dont know if it was the screenplay or what, but this movie just wasnt very memorable and not very captivating",1
"(umm) The whole premise of this movie is that (umm), the government has made an AI plane, which that means (stutter) artificial intelligence",1
"That (uhh), plane is very smart, and learns, and it put it together with this three man team, the three characters on the front to go on missions and then as the premise of the movie begins, it goes haywire",0
"So, from that point, Ill let you decide, but thats just on the back, the back (stutter) of the thing",1
Im not ruining anything for you,0
I dont think its possible,1
The movie ruins it for itself,1
"So, Id probably give it a, one out of five",1
"Today were gonna check out Mission: Impossible two, starring Tom Cruise",1
(uhh) Honestly I thought this movie sucked,0
"(uhh) Mission Impossible one, I thought was much better (uhh) because it was actually (uhh) it had a good plot",0
It was interesting and it wasnt just there (uhh) to to (stutter) throw in as much action as possible,0
It was a a (stutter) true spy movie,1
"This one (uhh) is to me, pretty much ridiculous and it seems as though, they were just trying to make it as extreme as possible and that is definitely the truth in one scene where (uhh) Tom Cruise (uhh) is riding through some flames on his motorcycle doing a nose wheelie and stuff like that",1
I mean just look at the cover,0
Look at that,1
Thats how extreme this is,1
Its a little too extreme for my taste,1
But if you like kind of dumbed down action movies then this is for you,0

"Many or at least the majority has been reported to be male, young male.",0
I will be reviewing the (uhh) special edition of Groundhog Day starring (uhh) Andie MacDowell and Bill Murray,1
"(uhh) This is probably one of my favorite movies and definitely my favorite comedy, you know, that I own",1
"Groundhog Day, for those of you who dont know, Bill Murray plays a very jaded you know, a very cynical (uhh) weatherman who is sent to, you know, his most (stutter) hated assignment, which is you know, covering xxx, the groundhog day to see whether he sees his shadow or not",1
"And he goes today, its a horrible day and theres a snowstorm so he cant leave the town so you know, he stays in the same place he stayed and when he gets up the next morning, its groundhog day again and you know the whole day just completely repeats itself, you know, hes kinda think hes going nuts and you know it just keeps happening over and over again even if he, you know, happens to die during the day, he literally just wakes back up and you know that same morning, (uhh) over and over again",0
"(umm) You know throughout he, you know the love interest, Andie MacDowell, falls in love (stutter) continually tries, you know, to get into the bed, you know, although he only has an actual day to do it because he keeps starting over",1
"I mean honestly, its just a really, really well made movie, its definitely (uhh) Bill Murray, you know, at one of his best and most comical roles",1
"His his (stutter) performance is absolutely hilarious, you know, the different emotions",1
"It kinda follows, you know, the (uhh) you know five stages of death, you know, where you have to denial and you know, anger, and you know finally at the end acceptance",1
"(umm) This is an all around great movie and you know, it does have a bit of (uhh), you know, philosophical vibe to it, you know, as far as, you know, should approach life but it doesnt really take itself too, too (stutter) seriously",1
"(umm) The disk itself isnt bad, its got an audio commentary by the director, you know, a documentary called the wait of time which is pretty cool, you know, some theatrical trailers and (umm) photographies, and thats really about it, theres not a whole, whole lot here but really, (uhh) this is the only version of the movie that I have ever seen and I just wanted the movie really, really badly, you know, the extras are kind of icing on a cake",1
Ill be reviewing Ang Lees Hulk,0
This is the two disc special edition,0
"(umm) I didnt really think it was possible for them to make a movie about the Hulk that was actually boring, but somehow they managed to do it",1
(uhh) This is one of the movies where I really found myself just constantly looking at the (uhh) at the clock to see how much longer it had,1
"You know, and Im a pretty Im pretty (stutter) big fan of, you know, slow paced movies",1
"I dont need a whole, whole lot of action",1
But this one just was badly paced,0
"(umm) You know, slow, (stutter) it was the characters werent developed enough, you know, to hold me, you know, during (ahh) the slower-paced parts of the movie and that kind of thing",1
(uhh) It was just kind of a poorly made movie in general,1
"You know, Ang Lee just really tried to put too much style and not enough substance into it",1
"(uhh) You know, the Incredible Hulk is basically about a scientist, Bruce Banner, who is messing with (uhh) gamma radiation",1
"And he turns himself into (uhh) basically this gigantic, when he gets angry, he becomes this gigantic green, you know, ridiculously strong (uhh) hulk",0
"And (uhh) {cough} basically his level of anger, you know, (stutter) correlates directly with, you know, how big he gets and, you know, the rest of the U",1
"government and all that has to try and stop him, {mumble}",0
"You know, its not that complicated of a storyline, honestly",1
(uhh) The DVD itself isnt too bad,0
"Its got some never (uhh) some deleted scenes, you know, (uhh) some (uhh) special effects documentaries",0
"You know, look at taking the Hulk from the comics to the movie",0
"(uhh) You know, a motion capture suit documentary",0
"So, you know, and some stills from the comics, that kind of thing",0
Ill be reviewing (uhh) Queen of the Damned,1
This movie is based of (uhh) Anne Rices vampire chronicles,1
"(uhh) Its basically about Aliyah who plays the queen of the vampires who is, you know basically brought back into modern world after you know being in hibernation basically by (uhh) Lestat who is Anne Rices kind of antihero who is now become a (uhh) rock goth you know, rock star who basically you know, brings her back",1
Area to consciousness through you know his attraction to him,1
And basically you know she wants to you know take over the world and all that other kinda stuff for vampires,1
(uhh) Its a pretty forgettable movie honestly you know its got a really heavy grunge soundtrack the movie kinda fits in its (stutter) shot you know very slickly,1
You know trying to be just very uber cool to the point where its almost just kind of goofy,0
Its kind of overdoes it in a lot a lot (stutter) of ways,0
"You know Aliyah is you know a decent performer, Stuart Townsend is kind of pretty (uhh) you know Brad Pitt did a lot better job playing Lestat",1
In (uhh) interview with the vampire,1
"(uhh) Than she does here, I mean than (uhh) Stuart Townsend does here",1
But the DVD itself you know if youre a fan of the movie is (uhh) you know pretty complete,0
"Its got audio commentaries, directors and special you know (uhh) documentaries on special effects",0
Its got music videos for some of the songs,0
{cough} You know that are used and saw in the movie,1
"And like I said its (uhh) its a pretty decent collection you know for this movie if youre a fan of Anne Rice you know and her particular interpretation of vampires which personally I think just kind of ruined the whole mythos you know vampires in general making them too I guess, gothic and you know upper class and emo and that kind of thing",1
"Hi everyone this is Matt Curfman here for our April edition of Matts Minutes for 2016. Its been probably 4 or 5 weeks since my last video and in that video I talked about trying to predict or rather not trying to predict what the markets will do in day, a week, a month even a six month period.",1
And I quoted Warren Buffett.,1
And so what I guess a little bit of a takeaway is were seeing the markets actually come off of their lows that had started back in March and were actually seeing some decent price recovery in the broad markets and in individual holdings.,1
"A lot of you attended and we actually were at full capacity at the end of March for our Halftime Report over at Ella Sharp where both myself and David had a chance to talk to a lot of you on what we thought was happening in the environment, explaining and clarifying that the environment is going to happen - we cant control the environment.",1
"We can control how we respond, how we react, how we plan in the volatile environments.",1
"So, many of you who rode through the market swings, we had 300 and 400 point days, I guess were getting a little bit more to a normalizing period, at least for now.",1
"Doesnt mean that thats going to continue but lets take a deep sigh, a deep breath, and just be comfortable where were at for the moment.",1
I guess I would tell you our tone is optimistic but were cautious.,1
We feel really good about making the decision to hold onto things through the downswing.,1
I told you in January and February and many of you received confirmations from Fidelity when the markets were at their lows we did actually make some changes within the portfolio.,1
Those by and large are playing out very well.,1
And so well continue to monitor each of those things and look for opportunities as they present themselves.,1
"Some of the bigger exposures you have would be high yield, things like a Medley Capital, a Pennant Park, a Guggenheim credit fund in addition high exposures in small caps, especially biotechs.",1

"I’m here in Edmonton with faith leaders from many different communities, and we’ve just had a discussion about religious freedoms in Canada",1
It’s a subject close to the hearts of millions of Canadians who see their faith as part of their everyday life,1
"Many Canadians grew up with a church or a synagogue nearby, a place where they could practice their faith, build community",1
Many more Canadians have come to Canada looking forward to the promise of a country where they could worship and practice their religion without fear of the persecution that is too often seen in other nations around the world,1
"The subject of our conversation today is clause 14 in omnibus Bill C-51, and the proposed changes by the Liberal government",0
The Liberals seek to remove a crucial section of the criminal code - one that protects religious leaders from intimidation meant to prevent them from leading worship for the communities,1
It also allows for charges to be pressed against those who disrupt religious services because of their intolerance,1
The Liberals say these protections aren’t needed,1
we say theyre absolutely wrong,1
"There are too many examples from around the world, and even here at home in Canada, where people are persecuted because of their faith",1
Removing protections for the people who help guide their faith communities will only embolden those who use the vile tactics of fear and intimidation against religions that they oppose,1
"Conservatives want to keep Canada a welcoming place, where the freedom to worship and practice your religion as you choose is a recognized basic human right",0
That’s why we will unconditionally oppose this Liberal attempt to take away those protections,0

"And todays topic is: Am I wasting my advertising dollars? Hello everyone, Im John Peterson with Develare And John Wanamaker once said, Half of the money I spend on advertising is wasted",1
"The question is, which half? Now, John went on to found one of the first successful department stores",1
"And he grew that into 16 stores, and those stores were eventually integrated into Macys",1
"And like, department stores, one of the easier ways to get traffic to visit your website, is to advertise",0
"There are a lot of different options out there for advertising, and the Better Business Bureau is probably a good option as any, Im a big fan of the BBB, and they also have a local directory section there",1
"You can find plumbers, you can find electricians, and yes, you can even find web designers",1
"Now, the question is, those visitors, were on the Better Business Bureau website, in that local directory area, do they go from there to your site? And you can find that out by looking at Google Analytics",1
"Theres a section there called referrals, so if you dig around in there, you can find the referrals section, by the way, if youre having trouble finding that referral section, just add a comment below, Ill be happy to tell you the exact method to get there, the exact steps to get there, but if you look at that referrals area, you can find entries, and you can find entries from all different websites visiting you, it might be Facebook, it might be Twitter, and in there, you should find an entry for the BBB",1
"And so, if theyre doing you some good, if theyre sending visitors your way, youll see an entry in there from the BBB",1
"And there will be some key stats in there, there will be stats like how long they were on your site, how many pages did these visitors typically visit, and whats the bounce rate, typically, for these visitors from the BBB? Now, the bounce rate, for those of you who dont know, without getting too much into the details, is people who come to your site, visit one page, and then, theyre out of there",1
"If they visit one page and bounce, or visit one page and go somewhere else, that affects your bounce rate",1
Lower numbers are better,1
"Anyway, so if you want to determine if your advertising dollars are being well spent on the Better Business Bureau, or any other website like that, you simply go to that referrals area, that will help you determine if that 50% of your ad dollars should go to them, or another resource",1
"The same tactic works for other directories, maybe, if youre in the Woodlands area, the Woodlands Online is pretty popular here, if youre in Katy, coveringkaty",1
"com has a yellow pages over there, theres probably other business directories in your local region or municipality, so keep lookout for those, look for opportunities to advertise, and then track them on Google Analytics and the referrals area",1
This has been the Friday Roundup,1
"Ill be reviewing the (umm) DVD version of Reign of Fire, starring Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale, with Christian Bale giving probably the worst performance of his career as far as Im concerned",0
I dont rate this movie very highly,0
I think its pretty hokey and pretty much a pretty forgettable throwaway (uhh) action movie,1
"(uhh) If you dont know what its about (uhh) its kind of the excavation of a new tunnel in (uhh) in England uncovers an egg of a dragon which hatches and manages to breed by itself creating a world of, of dragons and basically annihilates most of (uhh) human society as they burn scorch the earth and you know and feed on the ash kind of thing",0
"But theres you know, a rag tag groups of survivors you know, trying to fight the (stutters) the dragons and survive and (uhh) Christian Bale plays one of the survivors",0
"Matthew McConaughey plays a American group of survivors kind of show up and the two of em basically have kind of a dominance leadership fight, while trying to fight the dragons",0
"You know this movie is basically (stutter) designed simply around having, trying to have cool action sequences between modern jet fighters and (uhh) and ancient you know medieval era dragons and unfortunately a lot of the plot and character gets lost, you know ii that emphasis",0
Its just overall not a great movie,0
"You know its really good if youre just looking for something different or youre a huge fan of dragons, but otherwise its honestly pretty forget (stutter) forgettable",1
"The special feature includes, what youd usually see in you know, a mid level type DVD like this, you know",1
"It has a documentary on the special effects, you know the trailers",1
"Doesnt actually have a commentary track but it has what it calls a conversation with the director, which is basically you know, a pretty short short interview that doesnt really, you know, say that much about the direction because honestly there there wasnt really much that focus on the direction in the first place you know",1
"Its about pretty pretty average, like in general",0
"(uhh) But you know, like I said, if you like action movies you know, pretty B rated action movies or if youre a big fan of dragons, maybe its worth seeing",0
Otherwise its its (stutter) pretty forgettable,1

The Wicker Man,1
A remake of a (uhh) seventies (uhh) horror (uhh) psychological thriller film is no different from his other (uhh) action films that hes done,1
Its just not up to par,1
The story line in this film falls flat,1
I found myself actually rooting for the characters demise,0
(umm) Its more comical than serious,0
"(uhh) The acting is about the same {clears throat} Nicolas Cage serves up a big, hammy helping of his balding, cheesy smile and attempt at charisma",0
Doesnt work,0
(uhh) The only thing that really was interesting about this movie was the setting,1
Its set in a (uhh) small island off the coast of Oregon where a cult is (uhh) set up to (uhh) basically (uhh) (uhh) where Nicolas Cage goes to investigate a missing child,0
{clears throat} The scenes are really well done,0

And (umm) and he is next one that is anointed by God to (uhh) do a holy mission,1

"And theres two different (umm) I mean, theres a bunch of different names for this movie",1
"Its also known as Bruce Almighty two (umm) Bruce Almighty sequel, and The Passion of the Ark",1
"But, yeah, its about ninety minutes long",1
So its not very long at all,1
"And, honestly, it was just, its rated PG too, but, honestly, it really wasnt that good, {laugh} in my opinion",1
"I didnt think Bruce Almighty was that good, and Evan Almighty is the same except a little bit worse",1
So I would not recommend it,1

Welcome back,1
"This is Killfast37, and Im reporting in once again",1
"Now, todays review is going to be about a terrible movie called House of the Dead",0
Its its (stutter) a movie adaptation from the video game House of the Dead,0
It was very popular back in the arcades a few years ago,0
"Now, Uwe Boll decided to make a movie about it",0
And the movie didnt turn out so great,0
(umm) There are zombies that run and know Kung Fu,0
All the teenagers in the movie know how to use guns and all kinds of crazy stuff,0
And they all also know martial arts,1
"There are random explosions, random gore, random violence, and random sex",0
Its extremely {sigh} its hard to turn away,0
Its like a train wreck happening in slow motion,0
"You want to look away, but you cant",0
Thats how bad this movie is,0
"I mean, if youre a fan of zombies, dont even check it out",0
"Its just going to make you upset, like it has me",0
I love zombies,0
House of the Dead is not a good movie,0
Stay far away from it and burn it in coals when you do see it,0
"Its an abomination to the film industry, and its just, its just (stutter) awful",1
Please avoid this movie at all costs,1
"House of the Dead, I give you one star",0
"If I could give you less, I would",0
This is almost as bad as Manos Hands of Fake,0
"Well, thats all Ive got to say about this movie because its so terrible",1
Hey (uhh) this is a review of DOA: Dead or Alive,1
(umm) Probably never heard of it,0
(umm) It wasnt really advertised too much (uhh) probably with good reason they were probably embarrassed that they made it,0
"It was (uhh), its a terrible movie",0
It had very little plot,0
"(umm) The action, the fighting was good I suppose but (uhh) everything else was terrible",0
"(uhh) Well I guess (uhh) the cast was, the cast was good I liked the cast",1
"But (uhh) not for their acting abilities, mostly and it was mostly eye candy but (umm) yeah, it was pretty bad movie Id stay away from it",0
"(umm) I wouldnt even rent it unless youre very, very bored but there are a lot of better movies out there and give it a two out of five",0
So (uhh) yeah,0
Hey (uhh) This is a review of Pathfinder which (umm) youve probably seen the trailer,1
"It was awesome, and (uhh) very misleading",0
(uhh) You see the trailer was awesome but the movie (umm) was terrible,0
It was (uhh) it was terrible,0
(umm) The story was not (uhh) not up to par and the acting was pretty lackluster,0
"(uhh) The CG, FX fight scenes all that, they were good but it wasnt enough to save the movie at all",0
"(umm) But yeah it was, it was (umm) pretty bad show on their part",0
(umm) I would avoid it,0
Its its (stutter) not entertaining at all,0
(umm) Id give it a (uhh) one out of five if I could,0
"I guess probably closer to a zero, but I guess it rounds up",0

Hi,1
Im here to give you a video review of a terrible movie,0
"Mission Impossible Two, starring Tom Cruise",1
Now I Ive (stutter) honestly found the entire Mission Impossible movie series has been somewhat lacking,1
The first one had a insanely convoluted plot and was just difficult to follow,0
"The second one was probably the best out of all three, the third one was just terrible, not even worth mentioning",0
"This one is a hundred and twenty-three minutes long, so its pretty long, and it follows (uhh) Tom Cruises character as he tries to stop the deadly Chimera virus from attacking the world",0
Now one thing I thought was pretty cool about this movie was the technology they used called the facemaker,0
"(umm) It allows the characters to make an exact copy of someones face and then sneak in somewhere and then pull it off, and you never expect it until they actually pull it off",0
It looks really weird,1
"(umm) But the actual movie has kind of a fun soundtrack, it was real popular at the time, had some of the more popular bands",0
It was really trying to jazz up the series for the teenage market I think,0
"As you can see from the DVD cover here its got motorcycles and fire which are two things that are are (stutter) fun in the movie, but the acting is terrible",0
And honestly some of the action isnt as great as it could be,0
So while this can be a a (stutter) slightly fun movie I would probably only give it a two out of five,1
"So check it out if youre bored, but if youre not dont bother",1
Go see the original Jurassic Park instead,1
Hi {sigh},1
Tonight Im going to be reviewing a terrible movie called Killer Klowns From Outer Space,0
"Now this is pretty much, I mean its released by MGM but it was a very independent sort of movie",0
It was made by Orion Pictures Corporation,0
"Its very short, only eighty-six minutes long",0
"Its rated PG-thirteen and it is about killer clowns who are from outer space and they land in a field near a small town and they proceed to take, take (stutter) over",1
"And the movie also follows a group of teenagers who set out to destroy the clowns and reclaim whats rightfully theirs, their hometown",1
"But, I mean, as you can probably expect with a movie titled Killer Klowns From Outer Space the movie is just full of terrible acting and bad cinematography",1
Its a fun concept but they just didnt really pull it off that well,1
"So that I would just, I would give it a two out of five",1
It has some funny moments but overall its just not that great,0
"So (uhh) if someone gives you the DVD watch it, but I wouldnt spend any money on it like I did",0
This was kind of a waste of money,0
Hi Im Tom and Im reviewing broken lizards Club Dread,1
This movie is very bad Im giving it two out of five stars,0
"I loved broken lizards first two films, Puddle Cruiser and Supertroopers",0
"They were both really, really funny",0
Supertroopers is one of my favorite movies and Im really glad to know theyre now making a sequel,0
"However this movie is not anywhere on that level, its, its (stutter) bad in my opinion",1
It follows the broken lizard gang as they own a resort in the Caribbean,1
(uhh) And its just not very funny,1
"(umm) (stutter) There instead of being a cop parody, this is a horror parody and I feel there have been enough horror parodies done the past few years and this one is not very, very good",0
(uhh) There are some humorous taunt moments in it,1
"But overall the story is just, you know its just campy and its too cliche horror parody",0
"(umm) Supertroopers was still, very was still pretty realistic like yeah its, its (stutter) still comedy and its far fetched",0
"But this people I mean, I mean (stutter) I dont know I guess you know horror is so far fetched with people come back to life but this one is just not very good",1
"Hi, everyone",1
Today Im going to do my Expo review on this DVD movie called Final Fantasy seven,1
(umm) This is the two-disc special edition,0
"So it has the movie and then it has other scenes, clips, and other games or whatever on the second disc",0
"It came out a a (stutter) year or two after the the (stutter) Playstation game that was Final Fantasy seven, which was a great game",0
"This DVD, however, sucks",1
I really didnt like it,1
"It was all basically, its basically the game, but you just get to watch all the scenes in a movie form",1
"(umm) And it makes Cloud, the main character, look like a real big, like, sissy or something",1
"He doesnt look very (umm) heroic, like I thought he would have been in the game",0
"So I didnt really like this DVD, a waste of fifteen dollars",0
"You could probably get it for under five dollars now, since its so old and so bad",0
"(umm) I definitely dont suggest this to anyone whos played the video game, because it will ruin the game for you",0
And its called Final Fantasy seven,0

Hi,1
Today Im reviewing the movie Bridge to Terabithia,1
"In this movie the main, the two main characters are young children",0
"(uhh) one is a girl that just moved in, the other is a boy that lives close to this girl",0
"The girl had never really made very many friends, and the boy really doesnt have that many friends either",0
"(uhh) if you see the previews, the previews shows a lot of animation and a lot of, like (uhh) fictional characters that are in the movie",1
"(uhh) this is, to me, this movie was a very big disappointment",1
"(uhh) it really didnt have that many fictional characters or (stutter) they actually had every character that was shown, but theyre only there for like, if you took the whole movie, maybe a minute and a half, two minutes",0
"So, it was more, (uhh) you know, it, it (stutter) really didnt have the imaginary characters that you think the movie would have throughout the entire movie",1
(uhh) I was disappointed also in in the (stutter) how the movie (uhh) had a twist and it was a negative twist,0
"And I think the kids need positive twists, not negative twists",0
I thought overall the movie stunk,0
"You know, I mean it was good, but it wasnt good because of the twists it had and Im not going to tell you what the twist was, but youll see what it is, and I usually like to have childrens movies that have happy, happy movies throughout the entire movie and not to have disappointment in the movie",0
The product Im unfortunately reviewing today is Garfield the movie,0
"Now I didnt buy this movie, I dont think anybody bought this movie",0
"The stars of the movie, their parents wouldnt buy this movie",0
(umm) I won this (umm) at the second door prize something,0
(umm) The the (stutter) best thing I can say about this movie is that it comes in a fancy orange DVD case,1
(umm) They probably should have actually called the movie (uhh) Bill Murray needs a paycheck,0
(uhh) He does the voice of Garfield,0
(uhh) I dont know why (uhh) someone like Billy Murray would (uhh) slum it doing this,0
"(umm) The other stars in the movie are Brecken Meyers and Jennifer Love Hewitt, but theyre washed up its not surprising theyre in a movie like Garfield",0
(umm) The movie pretty much (uhh) (stutter) follows the plot of the (uhh) the daily comic,0
Garfield hates Mondays,1
Garfield loves lasagna,1
Garfield kicks Odie,0
"(uhh) This movie is not funny, its not good",1
CGI was stupid,0
"(umm) I, I (stutter) really dont know if just, never see this movie please",0
(uhh) I cant really say much more because I think Im going to go insane in front of this box any more,1
"Hello, I am Matthew and Im here to tell you about this DVD movie, Little Black Book",1
(umm) This is a romantic comedy,1
But I really didnt enjoy it that much I have to say,0
(umm) It wasnt very romantic,0
(umm) The jokes werent really that funny,0
It just didnt work,0
"(umm) The chemistry (stutter) between these two people, (umm) it just doesnt work",0
(umm) It was slightly choppy at times,0
"(umm) This is definitely a chick flick, I think (umm) many teenage girls would probably enjoy it and you know, I dont really mind (umm) romantic comedies (umm) if theyre good but this one just didnt work",0
(umm) It drug out,0
(umm) I couldnt wait for this movie to be over,0
"(umm) The only thing redeeming about this (uhh) movie, was about a thirty second cameo by (umm) Gavin Rossdale, which is a rock singer",0
(umm) That was the only thing I liked about this movie,0
(umm) This is not a good movie to watch with your girlfriend,0
(umm) I didnt enjoy it,0
Im not quite sure why this is in my video collection,0
"(uhh) Probably because I bought it about ten years ago, or actually I probably got it for Christmas",1
"But The Fast and the Furious starring Paul Walk, Paul Walk, Paul Walker and Vin Diesil",0
This is a terrible movie,0
(uhh) Theres really not much to say,0
Its about people that race cars (uhh) I dont understand the whole concept of it,0
"Okay, lets, lets (stutter) spend ten-thousand dollars on a Honda or a Toyota, something that sounds like youre about to go mow my yard",0
"Lets put forty to fifty-thousand dollars into this car and then go racing and be like, Oh, whats up man? Youve got a ten second car",1
No,0
"Why dont you take your money and go buy a viper? Why dont you go buy something thats actually fast and has a lot of muscle and enough torque to actually, like, bend your little honda civic in half or something? So overall I dont understand the concept",0
I think it promotes high schoolers to go buy Honda Civics and make them wice wockets,0
But other than that its not that great,0
"(umm) Its really corny, you know",0
"It was, its, dont watch it",0
Zero out of five,0
Oh I dont wanna play,0
Winnings too hard,1
Were so good everybody wants us to win state,1
"Yeah, well thats what they sound like in the movie with Billy Bob Thornton, Friday Night Lights",0
Its about Odessa Permia,0
"I dont know if if (stutter) anybody watches, follows Texas football",1
"Back in the early nineties Odessa Permia was, theyre like the hot shots back when North Mesquite Stallions, Odessa Permia, thats what this is about except this was before the Stallions were awesome",0
"This is back when (uhh) it was actually (uhh) Mesquite Carter, I think is what it was",1
But I dont know,0
"I am not a, personally I am a all-state athlete so I, I dont understand this whole everybody wants us to win, its so hard that I dont I dont, I dont (stutter) get it when people complain about stuff like that",0
But its a decent movie,1
"(uhh) I think it, I think it (stutter) spends too much time talking about the problems they have",1
Its not enough football,1
"I was, when I saw this I thought its like oh man, its going to be a great movie cause its gonna be about a great football team who had a great season",1
"(umm) No, its not about that",1
And actually its kind of funny (uhh) not many people know their story and they actually lost in that state championship football game so it really wouldnt have surprised me when they lost cause I knew that was coming,1
"But overall bad movie just from the simple fact that wasnt a lot of football, but if youre watching it because you want to see a drama of what its like to see, you know, high school kids pushed to the limit for a sport, you know, and it breaks them down and, you know, even the reality of all some kids can do is play football and if they get hurt, you know, and they cant go play college theyre pretty much stuck, you know, in that small Odessa town doing nothing and thats kind of sad, and I dont want to know about that stuff, because I know it exists but no reason to see it",0
"So Friday Night Lights, one out of five",0
"Hello, and welcome to the PHR Certification Exam page.",1
"The HR Certification Institute offers a Professional in Human Resources certification, or PHR, which focuses on the technical and operational aspects of human resource practices.",1
Hi,1
"Today Ill be reviewing the movie Live Free or Die Hard, which just just (stutter) came out a couple of days ago while Im reviewing this (umm)",1
"Basically, the the (stutter) fourth movie in the Die Hard series, The Die Hard Trilogy",1
It used to be a trilogy,1
"Now, its (uhh) four movies (umm) starring Bruce Willis, and this is (umm) talks about the story of John McClain, (uhh) NYPD Cop, now hes a detective",1
Hes not a cop anymore,1
"(umm) And going through all these action sequences and getting into all this trouble, I mean its really, really action packed",1
"The movie is around, I think two to two and a half hours long, (umm) and every minute of it is action",1
Just a lot of action,1
"If you love action, this is a lot of explosions, a lot of stuff crashing, a lot of helicopters, a lot of gunfire, everything",1
This movie is a lot of fighting,1
This movie has everything,1
Every moment is action packed,1
"(uhh) Basically, it goes through (umm), premise of the story is, theres this computer hacker (umm) who is trying to (uhh) like bring end of days armageddon to the United States by hacking into all like, the transportation systems, banking systems, air traffic, everything",1
Hacking (stutter) them and shutting them all down,1
"The electrical systems, natural gas, heating, everything, and shutting it down",1
"Basically, with America running on (stutter) computers, everything is run by computers",1
"He, by way by way (stutter) of just hacking into them and shutting them down, he shut down America, basically",1
Its a new form of (umm) electronic (uhh) internet terrorism stuff,1
And heres John McClain,1
Hes trying to (uhh) stop them,1
"And if youve seen the commercials, they probably captured his daughter and he has to go rescue his daughter also",1
So its like a personal vendetta thing and overall its very action packed,1
Highly recommend this,1
Five stars out of five,1
"Its a really, really good movie, (uhh) and its pretty good story too",1
Its not just action only,1
Blow up the bad guy,1
Kill the bad guy,1
Its a good story to it (uhh),1
Theres a lot of action,1
Every moment of it,1
Must have cost them hundreds of millions of dollars to make,1
"(umm) Its a very, its a feast for the eyes",1
"Its a very good movie, and I highly recommend it",1
"If (stutter) especially if you liked the previous three Die Hards Die Hards (stutter), (umm) this fourth one does not disappoint at all",1
So I give it five out of five stars,1
I highly recommend you go watch Live Free or Die Hard,1
"Hey guys Im here with a review of one of best movies ever made, Oldboy",1
"(umm) Its a Korean movie based off of the the Japanese mange (umm) and its (uhh) directed by (uhh) whats his name, Park Chan-wook",1
(umm) Its probably the toughest movie ever,1
(uhh) Its about a man who gets imprisoned for fifteen years (umm) and and (stutter) this this (stutter) prison is like a business where people can like have people held for as long as they pay them for,0
So (umm) hes trying to find out who paid to have him imprisoned,1
And theres lots of twists,0
(uhh) Really tough fight scenes,1
"(umm) Great acting, great story, just everything about it is pretty much perfect",1
(stutter) Totally five star movie,1
(umm) Very violent,1
Very just its probably the best revenge movie ever made,0
South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut,1
I actually got this movie probably about ten years ago,1
It was a movie I liked to watch when I played hooky to stay home and when I was faking being or being sick,1
I watched this movie,0
It was funny at the time,0
As I got older this movie became less and less funny,1
"(uhh) I cant really say South Park is stupid, but it actually is",1
My girlfriend loves it though,1
"(uhh) Its just not that funny, (uhh) you know unless you like (uhh) jokes dealing with bodily functions and (uhh) little kids dropping the f bomb",1
Actually Cartmans kind of funny,1
"The dealings with Cartman, that makes me smile every time",0
(uhh) The homosexuality between Satan and Saddam its not very funny,0
Its kind of weird,1
"(umm) I actually might need to watch this now that Saddam is actually no longer on this earth, because you can probably kind of picture Saddam being down there with Satan, you know",0
"(umm) You know, I think thats pretty evil really",1
I picked up Dark Blue on the recommendation of a friend,1
(umm) and I must say that I was not impressed,0
"(umm) I was not really familiar with Kurt Russell outside of a few TV movies that Id seen on TNT or TBS and I should have taken a clue from those movies because (uhh) he just, as a lead actor he just does not carry this role",0
I cannot buy into him (uhh) at all,0
(stutter) His dialogue just comes across as cheesy,0
He cant deliver the one liners well,0
"(umm) And all in all, just, I just was not entertained by this movie at all",0
"If youre looking for (umm) a movie about corrupt cops and the battle from within, I would recommend Training Day or (umm) I like Confidential over Dark Blue (uhh) any day of the week",0
"(umm) There are some memorable lines here, but again the acting just really didnt deliver with the kind of conviction needed to make this movie believable",0
"Its not , its not (stutter) a bad movie, its just definitely not a great movie",0
"If youve got nothing else to rent or to watch, pick this one up",1
COMFORTABLE SAYING FOR SOME REASON,1
"</i> I STAY IN A LOT OF HOTELS, A LOT OF BUFFETS",1
"THE BUFFET IS BASIC AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION, WELL, THINGS ARE BAD",1
HOW CAN WE MAKE IT WORSE,1

This is a story about a small rural village that holds its annual lottery.,1
All of the families in the village participate and the lottery starts by one representative from each family pulling a piece of paper from a box.,1
"A man named Bill Hutchinson has pulled the paper with the black dot, but his wife, Tessie, objects, saying that he didn’t have enough time to pick.",1
"Despite her protest, each member of the Hutchinson family, five in total, is required to pull slips of paper out of the box again to see who gets the black spot.",1
"In the end, Mrs. Hutchinson gets the black spot and is stoned to death as per tradition of the lottery.",1
"As always, a lot can be said about this story, but what draws my interest and attention is the idea that sometimes traditions can be dangerous in hindering progress and growth.",1
This is not to say that traditions are all bad and that we should always try to invent new customs.,1
Traditions serve an important role in our society.,1
"Holidays, for instance, remind us of family and continually slow people down from their busy lives and schedules.",1
"But as society changes, traditions should look to evolve instead of staying stagnant.",1
This means taking select qualities of the old tradition and incorporating new ideas.,0
"The identity of the tradition is not something else entirely, just modified.",0
"In the story, Old Man Warner is against change, even though other towns have stopped doing the lottery.",1
"He represents the ideology that current tradition is the best and that if it isn’t broken, don’t fix it.",1

"This is a story about a boy who is fishing in McElligot’s Pool, a small hole in the countryside that is polluted with trash.",1
Even a local farmer asks the boy why he’s fishing there since nothing comes out of the pool.,1
"The boy explains that while McElligot’s Pool isn’t the best place to fish, the pool might be connected to the open sea through underground channels, which opens the possibility that anything could be in the pool.",1
The boy continues to describe the different types of fish that might visit McElligot’s Pool.,1
"In the end, after finishing explaining why he fishes in the Pool, the boy waits patiently.",1
"As always, a lot can be said about this story, but what draws my interest and attention is the idea of the power of the word “Might” and ultimately the power of hope.",1
"Throughout the story, the boy uses “might” quite a bit when describing the different types of fish that could be connected to McElligot’s Pool.",1
"And this is important because he’s not saying that it’s so, but the boy does defend that it is possible, though not likely.",0
It’s this chance that these things could happen that drives the boy to further wait for something to bite on his fishing line.,1
But even if McElligot’s Pool is only what it appears to be - a small hole in the ground - is it good for the boy to be wishfully thinking that he might catch fish?,1
Of course it is.,1
"Some might argue that he is wasting his time or building false hope that will eventually crush him later because of big expectations, but that’s not the case here.",1

Hi Im Kendra Martin with M R C.,1
DAVID BELL: What Im most interested right now is in how internet retailers acquire customers.,1
And one thing we know from traditional retailing is its all about location.,1
"So location, location, location-- three most important variables in retailing.",1
"But there, were talking about the location of the store.",1
"And on the internet, what Im finding is that picture gets reversed a little bit.",1
"Its still about location, but now its about how the location of existing customers compares to location of potential customers.",1
"So what that means if you can sort of get a groundswell of demand going in a particular neighborhood, that can really take off.",1
So being able to see the right locations becomes very important.,1
"Online word of mouth is also very effective, but its not as effective as offline word of mouth.",0

"In the last few days, Iran has shown again why it can’t be trusted.",0
Iran insists on maintaining its formidable nuclear capabilities with which it could produce nuclear weapons.,0
Iran insists on removing all sanctions immediately.,0
And Iran refuses to allow effective inspections of all its suspect facilities.,0
"At the same time, Iran continues its unbridled aggression in the region and its terrorism throughout the world.",0
"So let me reiterate again the two main components of the alternative to this bad deal:  First, instead of allowing Iran to preserve and develop its nuclear capabilities,  a better deal would significantly roll back these capabilities – for example,  by shutting down the illicit underground facilities that Iran concealed for years from the international community.",1
"Hi, this is Jim Goettler on behalf of Expert Village and this is a video series about managing a political campaign, be it a campaign for public office or a campaign for an initiative.",1

What’s the secret to a happy marriage these days?,0
Separate bedrooms.&nbsp;The common wisdom has been that there’s trouble in paradise if couples sleep apart.,1
"New figures show that nearly 40-percent of couples sleep in separate beds or bedrooms; and they couldn’t be happier, because it means they get a good night’s sleep.",1
"Science backs it up, too.&nbsp;The study had couples sleep together one night and solo the next while researchers measured their brain waves to assess sleep quality.",1
The result?,0
"Couples said&nbsp;they slept better with their partner, but&nbsp;their brain waves showed they were constantly awakened by their partner’s sounds or movements and never reached the deeper, more restful stages of sleep.",0
More research backs up those findings.,0

Today we are going to talk about how to write job application letters.,1
Job application letters are very important when you are obviously applying for a job.,1
The importance comes from several things.,1

"I was there with my family in the room when three Dutchbat soldiers came, looked at my family and at me, and they told me, Hasan, tell your family that they have to leave the compound. And I knew I could stay because I had the contract with United Nations so the Dutch could not throw me out of the base.",0
"I was trying to convince the UN, I mean the Dutch and the UNMOs to allow my brother to stay at least.",0
"Hi how are you doing their, Stirling McAuliffe here chances are you landed on this video searching for a conventional loan if you didnt catch my first video",1
I went over the four main product types along with her down payments and sellers concession in this video were going to take a look into the conventional loan for a single-family home so if you see here we have a minimum down payment of three percent now that is if you are a first time homebuyer or have not had a property interest in a home in the past three years you can qualify for that three percent otherwise youre looking at a five percent down payment at minimum and then we have a three percent sellers concession now thats if youre putting anywhere from three percent to ten percent down if you put ten percent to twenty percent down the sellers concession goes up to six percent and any more than twenty percent it goes all the way up to nine percent thats a great feature of the conventional loan we have a minimum FICO score here of 620 gift funds get funds are allowed and two months of reserves so that means two months of a pity payment or mortgage Payment principal interest taxes and insurance so thats after your down payment and closing costs youre going to need to have at least two months of mortgage payment for reserves and then your mortgage insurance varies now whats great about the conventional loan is that the mortgage insurance goes away after you pay down twenty-two percent of the home so you have a seventy-eight percent LTV or once you have to twenty percent mark you can get your home assessed our appraised and if theres enough equity in the home they will take away the mortgage insurance or you can just put twenty percent down to begin with and not have to worry about it but very small fee to get into a home,1
All right I hope you like this video if you did please hit the like button below if you think that you have a friend out there who could find value in this video please go ahead and share it with them ill have more videos coming up about different types of conventional loans in regards to investment properties second homes and other homes as well so please give me a call my numbers below my email is below as well you have any questions or concern,1

"Mallika Sarabhai MALLIKA: First of all you have to look at the economy and our own happiness and the environment as competing for it as a no-no, and while the going was good, a lot of business was looking at it that way, that they could make a profit and it didnt matter that the environment was being destroyed.",0
"And its only after this downturn that people are even asking these questions, it is [ INAUDIBLE  ] asking these questions.",1

"Hi, I am Frank and today’s topic is “SAP C_THR12_66 exam and its preparation” first of all I will discuss about C_THR12_66 exam related skills and technologies.",1
Afterwards I will share my personal experience how you can reduce your chances of failure in SAP C_THR12_66 exam which is related to “SAP ERP” and credits towards “SAP Certified Application Associate Human Capital Management” Certification.,1

"at the speed to interviewer might ask you it at and then Ill say it slower so that if you didnt understand it the first time, you can try to understand at a slower speed first",1
Then Ill ask you the same question but phrased in a different way,1
"so, theres obviously lots of words in the English language and they all have similar means, like school, college university",1
"Its good to know all of these words so that when the interview asks you that, youll be able to understand it and respond back accordingly",1
"So, lets go ahead and get started",1

So impact investing is investing to make social change using something other than a grant,1
"So it could be a loan, it could be an equity investment, it could be a guarantee, theres lots of ways you can structure it",1
"The way I like to think about it is, can you broaden your tool chest chest beyond grant-making but still be thinking philanthropically about the kind of investment that youre making",1
"So, impact investment should not be seen as a substitute for philanthropy, but rather an additional thing that you can do",1
"And obviously the difference is when you make a grant you give money, hopefully something very good happens in the world",1
But if that thing needs to happen again you or somebody else needs to give another grant,1
"At its best what you can do with an impact investment is deploy that capital, that capital can be used by either nonprofit or for-profit to do the work that they do",1
But then that capital can be recycled and so hopefully they will not always need another grant another grant to keep on doing the good work that they do,1
Yeah so what Acumen does is we are investing in entrepreneurial solutions to poverty,1
"We do that primarily by investing in early-stage companies that serve poor customers, and also investing in leaders who we think and make a difference in the world",1
"So terms of transfer impact investing its definitely growing a lot, theres a lot of interest, a lot of banks are coming into it, you see a lot of philanthropists who want to find ways to do impact investments overall",1
"And so what we see is, a new products being created, new opportunities, but most of it is still its still early days I would say, and so you can look to your financial advisor, you can look to your philanthropic advisor, for opportunities that they may have for you to get involved",1
"You know I strongly believe that philanthropy is about expressing your passion, expressing your view for what the world can be, and from what Ive seen its really important for people to keep that connection and keep that flame lit",1
"So obviously you can give, but my advice would be to always stay close to the work",1
"Stay close to the people who are trying to help, are not only for your own motivation, but because youll learn and through that connection more change will happen",1
Whether thats deploying your skills or finding new ways to get involved,1
"The gentleman named Bryan Stevenson who has founded Equal Justice Initiative, a top piece of advice that Ive heard him give which I really embrace is to get proximate to a problem",1

So what I try to do and what I see the best philanthropist doing is overcoming those boundaries,1

My name is Julie Asti.,1
"Im a Certified Financial Planner with Asti Financial Management, and today Im going to talk about how to determine the fair market value of items that you may be giving to charity.",0
"The IRS has changed its rules in the last few years, requiring much more documentation for any amounts, excuse me, for any items that youre going to be donating to charity.",1
There are a couple of ways to determine the fair market value.,1
"For household items, electronics, furnishings, baby good, things like that that you would be donating to a Goodwill or a Salvation Army, you can determine the fair market value of those by looking at various sites online and just trying to find out what - what an item of the approximate age and condition would be selling for.",1
"Starting in the 1970s, Federal grants allowed me to study natural fracking in gas shales",0

"Thats what I did, I started my first company when I was 25, my wife was pregnant, and we had no money so it does work out, you just have to do it.",1
"Just to do, act, a lot of people have ideas and they think it could be great and do this and that and very few people kinda get off their butt and actually do it, so its taking action, any step is you know, a step forward.",1
The one piece of advise I would give is to document everything talk with your attorney and get everything legal.,1
If youre just doing it for the money youre never going to be as successful as if its a change you wanna see in the world.,1
Meet as many people as possible establish relationships youll learn from every relationship you make.,1

"Hi, to YouTube fraternity, nice sitting and chatting with you.",1
"And, I think the question really has a very natural answer - businesses, governments, political leaders - have to come together to address their climate-change issues.",1
"Through the 1990s and the early 2000s, the emerging nations were doing extraordinarily well, exporting a lot of goods to Western countries like America.",1
"And that, potentially was playing havoc with their currencies because the more goods they sold the more these western  countries had to buy the currency of these emerging nations.",0
"And the more that currency was likely to rise, which would mean those products would get too expense.",0
So what countries like China did in particular was to convert this currency into an asset and to buy assets from the very countries who are buying their own goods in a kind of virtuous circle.,1
"So China started amassing hundreds of billions of dollars of American debt, for example, using, dollars.",1
And that meant that America could keep buying cheap Chinese goods.,0
"Now of course in doing that, they provided America and indirectly, other nations, in the developed part of the world, with a lot of money at very low interest rates.",0
Because a lot of money was available.,0
So they didnt have to offer too much interest rates as governments to be able to sell that debt.,1
"So, with low interest rates, we got a stimulus to the economies of the West, in a way which is truly unsustainable.",0
So the buying of houses was cheaper than it should have been.,1
"The hiring of staff, cheaper than it should have been.",1
"Building factories, cheaper than it should have been.",1

"Hello, this weeks lecture is given by Zack Moir and Richard Worth.",1
Zach is a teaching fellow in the Reid School of Music at the University of Edinburgh.,1
"He has a strong research interest in music pedagogy, in higher education.",1
"He also has interest in musical improvisation, popular music and the musical experience of cochlear implant users.",1
Hes also an active musician and composer.,0
"Richard has a PhD in composition from the University of Edinburgh, and is also a teaching fellow here.",1
"Throughout the 90s, he lived in New York, performing and recording with his band, Groove Collective.",1
"Since then, hes lived in Scotland, studying and teaching.",1
"In this first lecture, were going to start with music at its most basic level, sound.",1
We will look at how music can be created by exploiting the relationships between sounds.,1
"As were interested here in music literacy as well as theory, we will be looking at how written notation can graphically represent these musical sounds.",1
"Now, as is this is the first lecture, theres just one thing I want to underline here before we start.",1
All kinds of superb musicians get by just fine without reading or writing music.,1
Being able to read and write musical notation does not make you a composer or a musician any more than not being able to read and write means you cant compose or play.,1
Understanding musical notation doesnt necessarily even make you a better musician.,1

Are you interested in three tips that will help you build a strong foundation for a legal nurse consulting practice?,1
My name is Pat Iyer.,0
In 1987 I began reviewing cases as an expert witness and in 1989 I began building a solid foundation for a legal nurse consulting business.,1
Here are three principles of a successful legal nurse consulting business.,0
"First, recognize that you need a solid foundation in clinical nursing to be able to work most effectively with attorneys.",1
Understanding how the health care system runs is invaluable when youre helping attorneys.,1
Nurses who have experience only in non-clinical roles are going to find it tough to perform some aspects of legal nurse consulting.,1
"Secondly, be aware of the advantages and disadvantages up working on cases for attorneys who could swamp your firm with volume.",1
"For example, a multi-district litigation case could become an elephant that takes over the time that you would have had for attorneys who send you one case at the time.",1
I learned this the hard way when we worked on pedicle plates and screws cases.,1
Our regular clients noticed the longer turnaround time for their cases.,1
We were on a continuous treadmill churning out reports and were relieved when the cases finally wound down.,1
"Lastly, never stop marketing.",0
Your primary client could have a suddenchange in practice due to a change in the law or could leave the farm or drop dead.,1
At one point I got thirty percent of my income from one law firm.,1
It would have been tempting to sit back and relax but I never stopped a marketing.,0
Hey guys today I want to talk to you about Smiley360. Short and simple its a community of people that review different products brands.,1
And its all free.,1
They just ask that you share your experience with that brand or product and tell your friends about it.,1
And the more offers you complete the more points you get and that also leads to more products that you get to try.,1
I found that most things you actually get from Smiley 360 are the actual product rather than a  free small sample.,1
My names Adam Johnson and like a lot of people I started to experience serious hair loss about eight years ago.,0
It was slow at first I hadnt really thought anything of it until I noticed my hairline starting to recede and my hair was considerably thinner than it used to be.,0
So I talked to my doctor about it and he said well its probably just genetics and there is nothing we can do about it. That certainly didnt make me feel any better.,1
I just looked awful without my hair so I decided it was time to fix this!,0
I was surfing online I noticed a website that talked about a product named Hair Again.,0
"So I read through the information and I thought hey, there is nothing to lose by trying it theres even a money back guarantee. And when i received the information I devoured it because it made so much sense to me.",1
After all this hair loss was reversible and it was never my fault.,1
I followed the instructions closely and after a few weeks the hair loss actually stopped.,1
Then as if by some miracle I noticed to my hair seem to start becoming thicker like it used to be and now here I am today with a full head of hair and a smile on my face.,1
Thanks to Hair Again.,1

"Now in such circumstances we put safety first, we don’t take any risks.",1
"The service is suspended while we await the Toronto Fire Service to give us the all clear that we can resume services, and around the same time we had a number of passenger alarms, then there was a further incident at Dupont station in which the doors were opened in the tunnel while the train was stationary by a staff member and clearly we’re looking into how that could have happened.",0

"Ive been here for two months, and I must say Im impressed by two things.",1
One has been the enormous magnitude of this catastrophe.,1
Its literally unimaginable--perhaps indeed unprecedented--in the history of the Western Hemisphere.,0
"This is a situation where hundreds of thousands of people--three percent of the country--lost their lives, where much of the government was decimated, and its a country that was starting in very poor circumstances in the first place.",1
PwCs Health Research Institute has warned healthcare firms and organizations that they will need to act fast now that the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Act.,1

Welcome to the end of week two.,1
My names Anthony Cosgrove and Im one of the educators on this British Council course about Magna Carta.,1
Weve had lots of interesting discussions this week and again its been great to see so many of you taking part.,1
Weve heard about lots of countries and their struggles for independence especially around South Asia and in Europe.,1
Weve enjoyed good discussions about the the American Declaration of Independence with its famous line that All men are created equal which students such as Robin Spencer and many others have had lots of good critical insights about.,1
"Several of you have also nominated somebody who has fought for the freedom of their country, María Gema Grande Sosa nominated Lech Walesa from Poland, Nang Sandar Myint and many others from Burma nominated Aung San Suu Kyi and Zainab Abdul Maroof nominated Jinnah in Pakistan and weve had many other nominations as well.",0
"But the video also prompted discussion about other subjects as well, such as language variety in English and other languages and Daniel Kutzev, Michele Patel, Dolors Gea Valor and many others have had great discussions with lots of things to say about that.",1
"Weve looked at some language this week, phrasal verbs in particular such as stick up for someone, look out for someone and get round to doing something and again lots of you have had lovely examples.",1
Godelieve Ashworth for example said that she has to put up with her husbands snoring and that this has done her out of many hours of sleep over the years.,1
"Thank you for that Godelieve, we all enjoyed your comments!",1
"perfectly natural and normal, and maybe the biggest thing that will hold you back is when youre afraid of making them",1

to your supplier that is valid in the states where the delivery occurs and you will be required to obtain a certificate from your customer in the delivery state,1
"To minimize this second risk, you must be proactive in obtaining valid documentation at the time of the sale",1
The third area putting multistate companies at risk is the use of incorrect tax rules being applied to the goods and services they sell,0
"Hundreds of changes occur each year, some changes are legislative and are well published",1
"But other changes come from court cases, rulings and regulations which may go unnoticed",0
Many of these sales tax changes are subtle and may post little risk to your business,1
Other changes can be significant and create a material financial risk for your company if you are not updating your sales-tax rules properly,1

law here here in Iowa since 1997. Todays topic is going to be independent medical examinations.,1
"Theres basically two different types of these, the first one is when the insurance company says hey we want to send you for an independent medical examination but make no bones about it, these are rarely independent when its the insurance company that is scheduling these.",0
There are some points and tips that I can give you when dealing with the independent medical examination requested by the insurance company.,1
"In fact, I dont call them an independent because it is a defense medical examination.",0
No independent party picked that doctor.,1
"In fact, the defendants, the insurance company and or your employer has picked that doctor.",0
So theres definitely some things you need to look out for when they are scheduling one of those types of examinations.,1

"The polls collect that, bundle it, and sell it for massive profits so that politicians can lie to you better",0
"The whole reason that you get sort of Etch-O-Sketch politics, that was the quote out of Romneys campaign that between the primaries and the main election, you just shake it up and start over with the new message",0
Politicians can do that because they have faith that the polls are accurate,0
"If the polls tell them the right lie, then all they have to do is always give the right lie",1
"Now the next thing that you want to avoid, and Im going to go ahead and tell you right up front before I tell you what it is, very hard not to do.",0
"And what that is are uh, err, uh, um.",1
This is the hardest thing to stop doing as a public speaker.,0
And the reason is is because its habitual.,1

"They have an ice cream franchise, and one of the things theyve seen go up in terms of pricing this year are the cost of pecans.",1
I think they said they doubled on the box of pecans they get for their various ice cream dishes and so forth.,1

"Do they change the pricing all across the board, or do they just add a surcharge for things that use the pecans?",0

"You know, a CEO from India said to me the other day, you know, for the past 20, 30 years we looked at the U.S.",1
"as the bastion of capitalism, the example that we hoped to be.",1
"And we made that bet, as he said, he took all that -- he said his country took of its chips and moved them from black to red on the roulette table.",1
"But now were looking at the experience you had in the U.S., and were saying, maybe we made the wrong bet.",1
"How well do YOU know You-Know-Who? Well for one thing, you probably dont even know his NAME... Voldemort may as well be Vol de mort, which means Flight from death in French.",1

"&gt;&gt; What companies, governments, countries individuals can do to make the world a better place - is be honest.",1
Thats the first step  - to actually be honest.,0
"Its fine to make commitments, its fine to make pledges, its fine to say well do this and that, but unless its actually executed - unless the promise is made real, then it, its kind of pointless.",0
"I mean its very easy to make pledges - its very easy to, to say well do this and that and never do it.",0
"Before we talk about specific drugs and their physiological, behavioral and psychological effects.",1
"Its important to review some of the material that we learned in lesson three, the Biology of Behavior.",1
"First, remember that the central nervous system is comprised of the brain and the spinal cord.",1
You should also review the autonomic nervous system as many drugs effect both of these nervous systems as well as their functioning.,1
"Hi everyone, I wanted to share some information about the HiSet test You may have heard of the new HiSet, or High School Equivalency Test, and have some questions about it.",1
"Thats perfectly understandable, because if you didnt graduate from high school, the HiSet could be your key to a great future.",1
"Having a high school diploma or the equivalent is extremely important in modern America, as almost all employers now require applicants to have one, including for jobs that pay only minimum wage.",1
"Plus, going to college is basically impossible for people without this important piece of paper.",1
"For decades, people who hadnt finished high school had only one option, which was earning a GED, or General Equivalency Diploma.",1
"This program was used in all states, and nearly all employers and colleges treated a GED certificate just like a high school diploma.",1
"That is changing, though, because recently the cost of taking the GED suddenly doubled.",1
"So dozens of states began looking for an alternative program, and thats where HiSET comes in.",1
"It was designed to provide people with a way of showing they possess high school levels of knowledge just like the GED, but at a much lower price.",1
"The HiSET is in many ways very similar to the GED exam, covering several different subjects that typical high school students take, such as math, reading, English, science, social studies, etc.",1
"It will take most of the day to complete the entire exam, and the format is multiple-choice.",1
"However, unlike the GED, the HiSet can be taken either on a computer, or with a pencil and paper.",1
"This is really helpful, because people shouldnt be held back from improving themselves just because they dont have good computer skills.",0
"If youll be taking the HiSET, make sure you prepare well so that you can get a passing score and start on the road to a much better future.",1
"If you need more help, check out Mometrix.",1

"DAVID ROMAN: The basics of marketing dont really change, and for any marketer coming up with a differentiated story of what your product, your brand, brings to your users is what youre going to do.",1
"I think people look at technology in a traditional way of saying well heres another way to deliver that story, and a lot of the innovation has been through different delivery vehicles, and so on.",1
I dont think that really counts as innovation anymore.,1
"I mean, that happens all the time, every day theres something new, and yesterday it was blogs, today its Twitter, theyll be something else tomorrow, and I think those are key things to follow, but thats more part of the process of doing it.",1
I think the real innovations are coming more in terms of how we define what the brand really represents to our best customers.,1
"Not all customers, but the best customers.",1

The last decade was marked by inadequate consumer protection and irresponsible lending.,1
Overly complicated mortgages and other credit products were allowed to flourish.,1
"This left many Americans in the dark about the real costs, risks and consequences of the unaffordable loans that were underwritten.",0
"Even borrowers who avoided risky credit were harmed by it, because home values went through the roof and then fell off a cliff.",0
"At the time, seven different federal agencies were responsible for consumer financial protection, but consumer financial protection generally wasn’t their top priority.",0
And none of them had the full picture of what was happening across the markets.,0
"In other words, there was no accountable cop walking the beat.",0
"“He was always looking and just the way he interacts with people, the way he likes to help young players is great",1
"He came over straight away and was talking to us, saying, ‘Don’t be nervous, just play your own game’",1
"Even when I was out on loan he was sending me text messages saying, ‘Well played’ or, ‘Keep going’",1
"“After games when I’d scored or had done well he’d text me saying, ‘Well done’ or ‘Congratulations’",1
"bulls eye, but you miss",1
That means its time for the open letter,1
"An open letter to the tragic hero, a type of character, of course, exemplified by Chewbacca",1
My name is Julie Asti.,1
Im a certified financial planner with Asti Financial Management.,1
And Im here to talk about how to monitor your stock portfolio.,1
There are a few ways that you can monitor your stock portfolio.,1
"If you own stocks through a brokerage account, a Morgan Stanley, a Smith Barney or even a Schwab or a Fidelity, you could access your account online and they will a listing of all of the holdings that are in your portfolio, that will be updated with market prices.",1
"Korean society is becoming more and more complex, thanks to the developments in science and technology, but the countrys criminal landscape is also expanding",1
That means the police must also equip themselves with the latest state-of-the-art technology,1
"One of the KCSI teams most prized pieces of equipment is its portable forensic lab, which allows investigators to do a preliminary analysis of the DNA samples they collect on site",1
before sending the results back to the main lab for further analysis,1
"The teams senior investigator says such advanced technology helps the KCSI team work more efficiently, no matter where theyre called to duty",1
"The police started implementing basic scientific research in 1948, but the KCSI team in its modern-day form was established only in 2004",1
"The main reason, it’s important, is actually that it exists at all When you look back to when our discussion started in the 1990s Actually there was no dialogue.",1
"There was a series of accusations, keep in mind this was before China joined the world trade organization There were a lot of pointing fingers, China doesn’t do this, China doesn’t do that; the Chinese legal system doesn’t have this provision, that provision You’re never going to join the modern globalised economy in this situation In the mid-1990s, I once met a Chinese assistant minister of trade, who stood in front of a lunch room, a lunch event, of a hundred or so people and stuck a finger in my face, and said ‘you are the reason that we’re not in the WTO’ because I was making arguments like this The EU-China dialogue and the EU-China cooperation projects changed that At the time that I was acting director, first acting EU director of the, what we now call IPR1 in the winter of 1999, no one else was doing this People were arguing, they were negotiating about the WTO but they weren’t talking, they weren’t training, they weren’t exchanging experts.",1
"So it’s actually a tremendous achievement that we do it at all Now the next step obviously is that you go, it’s a bit like the Olympics , you want to go higher, faster, better, or deeper or more intensely, whichever adverbs you choose.",1
"Hey, we are working on a fabulous introduction speech.",1
Let me tell you something that you dont want to do.,1
One word: gush.,0
"On Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed overwhelmingly with bipartisan support the medical marijuana bill that legalizes medical marijuana and gives doctors the ability to treat their patients with one more approach to healing.",1
I intend to sign it.,1
"I think its a grand step forward for Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania medicine, and certainly for the individual Pennsylvanians and their families who are suffering from so many different diseases that could be helped with medical marijuana.",1
"On Thursday I was in Pittsburgh at the Heinz School at Carnegie Mellon to talk about government reform and really what I talked about was building on what I had been doing since I was inaugurated in the executive branch in terms of making government work better, and more democratically, and more openly.",1
"And I want to broaden that to the rest of government, state government so that people have a reason to trust their public servants in Harrisburg.",1
"Theres a broad feeling in Harrisburg that we need to do a better job with things like the gift ban, with things like campaign finance reform, and lobbying disclosure, that kind of thing, so that we can actually get to a place where the people we serve in Harrisburg -- the citizens of Pennsylvania -- actually have confidence in their government.",0
"On Wednesday, I was presented a budget -- a so-called budget -- by Republicans in the Senate and the House.",0
And it had the problem that a number of their budgets -- sort of a pattern of the past -- that the budget didnt actually add up.,1
"ATHENA REICH: In this clip, Im going to talk about sustainability, how to not burn out.",1
"Auditioning, no one said its easy and no one said its going to be fun every day.",1
"Sure, sometimes you get that little adrenaline thrill after an audition but honestly, nobody gets every audition that they go to.",1
"Its just so competitive, theres so much talent, and youre just not going to be fit right.",1
"First of all, no, that they dont always take the best auditioner; they take the person who fits the role the best, who everyone on the panel can agree on.",1
"So, you might have two out of five people thinking youre the best and then but theres two other people who love someone else.",1
what does that even mean is that the prisoner that like beats up the most amount of people is that the prisoner that rapes the most,0

Janet Yellen gave an accomplished performance at her Senate confirmation hearings overnight in Washington DC.,0
"Her well-established Keynesian credentials were evident, and Yellen indicated that she will continue Bernankes easy money policy.",1
"However, when she was questioned by senators on the issue of asset valuations, Yellen took a stance that raised eyebrows in the markets.",0
She said that there is “limited evidence of reach for yield” and the Fed doesnt see a “broad build-up in leverage”. Her claim that investors arent grasping for yield is clearly debatable.,0
Investors lapped up the idea that QE is likely to continue for some time yet.,1
"Yellen aside, every indicator has asset prices racing higher.",0
"And if you would just break through, and if you would just believe the Gospel, and press in",1
And not be concerned about other people around you,1
As you are concerned with your relationship with Christ,1

I think that this is a good time for the African countries to show their strengths.,1
Thats a very very powerful thing,1
Now if he wanted to he could bring the table saw into court and he could have the witness recreate everything that went on,1
"If he contradicted something at trial with what he already testified to years earlier in his pretrial testimony, now the defense lawyer can use that to show that there are clear contradictions between what he said earlier and what he said now",1
Thats a great strategy for the attorney,1
Why do I share this information with you,0
I share it with you just to give you an inside look at one strategy a defense attorney used when questioning my client during the course of his law suit,1
&gt;&gt; My name is Kojo Parris.,1

&gt;&gt;SHARON BOWMAN: Most of you dont know me.,1
"Those of you who do may be surprised, amused or both that I am on the ballot for APA president.",1
I am a relatively unknown entity with the honor of being asked to fill the last spot on slate.,1
"On July 10th, however, the Hoffman report tilted our professional world.",0
"Suddenly, holding a spot on this slate became overwhelmingly real.",1
"In the ensuing days and weeks, many of us have overdosed on post-Hoffman email with demands and counter-demands for change and accountability in our leadership, along with recriminations and accusations about what has happened.",1
Some people are convinced we need a president with high-level APA governance experience to lead APA.,0
"I do not have that experience, not having served on council of the Board of Directors.",1
"Instead, heres what I do offer: the outsider voice.",1
Being too deeply on the inside may be a detriment because sometimes we can only see what we already know.,0
&gt;&gt;DAMON WILLIAMS: I am the Senior Vice President and Chief Education and Youth Development Officer for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America.,1
"In that role, I help to shape the education policy and youth development direction for more than 4,000 clubs that are part of our federated network, having an impact on more than 4 million young people across this nation.",1
"For me, the entirety of the journey and the role into success has really been about understanding my passion, where I had potential, and ultimately what my purpose was in life.",1
"And, for me, thats always been skewing towards those individuals who are vulnerable, helping individuals to find the pathway to empowerment, and trying to be a difference maker in the lives of those who I come into contact with.",1
"From my beginning moments here at Miami University, where I was a student leader, where I thought and tried to be a scholar student, through to my work at other institutions, crescendoing to my current role now at Boys and Girls Clubs of America, thats been the pathway.",1
"My liberal arts degree in Black World Studies and Sociology was essential to me in terms of helping me develop a type of critical, analytical lens that has allowed me to author numerous articles, multiple books, numerous monographs, Ive lectured at more than 400 organizations around the world, and the foundation of it oftentimes will find its way back to my liberal arts experience here at Miami University.",1
It was here that I was really first exposed to the idea of a critique and really first exposed to the importance of having burning questions that live inside of you that you want to answer.,1
"At the end of the day, research, scholarship, its all about asking questions and finding answers using different methodologies to get there.",1
"The liberal arts experience here at Miami, and specifically, the bachelors degree in Black World Studies and Sociology, put me on that pathway.",1
"I had incredible mentorship and connectivity with the faculty in the College, in addition to other faculty across campus, because the Black World Studies program did have an affiliated faculty group which lived in other areas of the institution.",1
"that they can infringe upon, then they love that",1
"You know, theyre basically just joy destroyers",0
"You know, they want to just take any kind of joy that they can",0
And theyre limelight seekers,1
"And so, you know, anything that they can do to make you feel worse, to get more attention, to ruin anything that might be for you or your children or something",1
A good and positive happy memory that they can now just hold that memory hostage and take it over,1
They love to do that,1

"I would like you to consider all of your options of the schools of optometry we have, there is currently 20. I think we are all good in our own ways.",1
We have pros and cons with each program I think that I like students to make the decision on where to go based on their comfort with the program.,1
Whether it be the environment of the school or the size of the program.,1
We are a mid-size program here at Indiana University so we admit 75-80 students each academic year.,1
"We are a Big 10 campus setting, like what you are used to at University of Illinois so no big surprises there, but nevertheless whatever program you are looking at we want it to be the best fit for you and cost aside or other issues that schools don’t really have any control over.",1
I think visiting the schools you are interested in in advance is important.,1
"Hello, Im Cherie Ashwood.",1

"Consolidated means lumped together, and you may find that you...you have taken out student loans to...towards the benefit of your education, that what you actually have is several different loans that have been awarded to you, either each semester, or each year.",1
"The interest rate on these loans may all be different, based on whatever the prime rates were at the time that you were awarded the loan.",1
There are several different companies that will offer you student loan consolidation.,1

Its a serious investment.,1

"Couture could start at around $25,000. Per garment and go up into the millions and thats very conceivable.",1
We have lots of traditions that were very proud of,1
"One of them, for instance, for graduate students is High Table at the graduate college where faculty members like me go and present and then talk to students at dinner, at High Table",1
"So, its that combination of the old and the new that gives this place its special character",1
One of the most wonderful traditions is really the hooding ceremony,1
"Hey, this is Ken from AES.",1
Sometimes were asked about the difference between what we do and a textbook.,1
Lets talk about textbooks first.,1
The best thing about a textbook is you can buy it once and you can keep using it for three or four years.,1
"If your school runs into financial trouble down the road you can always stretch it for that fifth year or sixth year, as long as you want to keep using it.",1
"Of course, the biggest disadvantage of a textbook is the same as the advantage.",1
I see a couple trends.,1
Whats up party people? Its Chris Derose,1
"The Community Director of the Counterparty Foundation and today I wanted to answer the question, what is a cryptoequity? A cryptoequity is a new kind of term and we know what traditional equities are",1
We think that cryptoequities are going to be something pretty different,1
"Theres a lot of different definitions going around, and its kind of up in the air so in many senses its what we make of it at this stage, but theres a couple things that we know it is",1
Right off the bat we have counterparty assets,1
"Counterparty assets are digital assets, they dont take up space per say, or they might but they arent managed by a central authority",1
In some ways theyre kind of parallel to what you would see perhaps in a DNS model with domain names being handled as a scarce resource by the ICAN [SP],1
"Of course in the case of counterparty, and of course in the case of cryptoequity, there is no central holder, or central clearing house or central repository for these equities",1
"They exist as assets, assets themselves are up to users to define and you can call these assets whatever youd like",1
"In traditional equity terms, we have things like stocks so maybe you have a website venture, or maybe you have a new VC funded or Crowdfunded venture that you want to do",1
"You can define shares, you can define the name of your company as an asset name and you can declare that to the network and you can declare that as having x number of shares",1
"Maybe you have 1,000 shares or 100,000 shares",1
"Maybe these are non-divisible shares, thee are non-divisible in the sense that they dont have sub-units",1
They are just tokens that are themselves a percentage of a a whole,1
Those would be a very bare bones definition of what a cryptoequity is but it goes a little bit further from there,1
Cryptoequities can also be things like tied to tangible goods,1
"Maybe you have a bank of gold or copper or some such thing and you want to declare to the network that you are the holder of that repository, that it is yours but the equity itself is decentralized and it is declared on the network and it represents some fractional holding of that store of that traditional commodity",1
"In some senses, in that case its a bit centralized and requires trust upon the person declaring the asset but certainly is doesnt require trust on the part of the clearinghouse or the counterparty agent",1
"That would be another use for cryptoequity, but theres more exotic definitions of cryptoequity as well",1
These could be things such as karma perhaps,1
"Maybe what you do is on a reddit type site, you issue karma for people who contribute content",1
This content is itself a fractional share of perhaps the advertising revenue,1
"That would also be a new form of cryptoequity and we dont really know where this is going but these are the types of things that people can start doing with counterparty, with cryptoequities and these are the types of directions that people will take",1
"Right now there is a [inaudible 00:02:27] project, which is a bridge between the old world of equities and the new world of cryptoequities",1
"That project is still in development, its too soon to talk about and we will see what happens but youll start to see the divide between equity in traditional shares and safe models and the cryptoequity model start to blur perhaps over time",1
What we can be certain of is that cryptoequities are decentralized,1
"They are tied to the security of the network in terms of a cryptographic scarcity and they will be available through protocols like if not, certainly, counterparty and they will be done by people like yourselves, so go ahead and create your own cryptoequity",1
Show us how this is going to work in the modern world and show us what youre doing with it,1
In fact when you do it let us know,1
Send an email to me,1
My name is Julie Asti and I am a Certified Financial Planner with Asti Financial Management and today I am going to talk about how to start a foundation.,1
If you want to start a foundation there are really two initial things that you want to consider.,1
First if you want it to be a private foundation or a public foundation.,1
A private foundation is one that is usually funded from one source.,1
"Now, youve watched the whole tape.",1
You have critiqued your performance.,1
"It is essential that you critique yourself in an honest, fair manner.",0
Hi Im Sarah and my role at Aston University is to go into Sixth Forms and Colleges and speak to students about the university application process and how to write an effective personal statement.,1
"When speaking to students, my top tip is to approach the application and the personal statement as you would any other academic essay - the hardest part is getting pen to paper and coming up with some initial thoughts.",1
Theres loads of resources on the UCAS website which will help you to do this.,0
Things such... about creating a mind map and a timeline about some topics which you might want to include in the personal statement.,1
"Once you have those initial thoughts gathered on a piece of paper, you just need to approach the structure as you would any other academic essay.",1
"We like to see an introduction which focuses on your fundamental reason for why youre choosing that subject, why you want to study that at university... You then going to talk about your academic focus, so what knowledge you may have learned  in your year 12 and 13 subjects which has prepared you for studying at university, any extracurricular activities which much support that knowledge, so if you maybe volunteer, if youve got a part-time job, if youre a captain of a sports team - all of these extracurricular activities give you valuable transferable skills which will help you with your academic studies at university.",1
We would then like to see just a nice little summary to the personal statement to bring it to a close.,1
"Im Megan Edwards for InvestmentPitch.com PI Financial has initiated coverage on MAG Silver, symbol MAG on the Toronto Stock Exchange.",1
"Analyst Philip Ker gives the company a buy recommendation, with a speculative risk rating, and a12-month target of $9.00, a premium of 15% to the $7.80 price the day the report was issued.",1
MAG Silver is a silver explorer and developer with ideally situated projects located in two of Mexicos premier mineralized silver belts.,1
"The Juanicipio property is MAGs flagship asset and lies within the prominent Fresinillo silver belt in the state of Zacatecas, which to date has produced more than 4 billion ounces of silver.",1
"&gt;&gt; Um, will China pull us out?",1
"Let me also stand back and remind -- I think this is an important reminder -- what the United States seeks in Syria, what we have been working for, for more than a year now: We support a unified, free, prosperous, and tolerant Syria that respects the rights of all its people and becomes a force for stability and peace in the region rather than a threat.",1
"And no matter how the unrest in Syria ends -- and its going to end; Assads time will come -- its going to take a lot of hard work for the Syrian people to rebuild their country and begin this process of political transition that gets them where they want and deserve to go, which is not a Syria that trades one tyrant for another set of tyrants, or one tyrant for a set of extremists, but a Syria that is able to make the transition to a democratic, tolerant, prosperous, unified country.",1
"So our policy is directed, first and foremost, towards squeezing the Assad regime to end its violence, but also to support those Syrians inside and outside of the country who are working for that kind of future.",1
"Thats what our nonlethal assistance is designed to do, thats what our training is designed to do, to help Syrians unify behind these kinds of objectives -- a real transition plan to get there, new leaders who are prepared to bring Syria into that kind of future, to resist extremism, to work against it, to not allow their own fight for freedom to be hijacked.",1
Thats what we are working on.,0

I want it to be a fun way to learn more about your favorite films and help us all become better storytellers,1
History is an impertinence and an injury,1
"Our religion, we have not chosen, but society has chosen for us",1
Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members,1
"We must, he argued, live from within trusting nothing but our own intuitions",0
nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind,1
This leaves open a vital question: What is your nature,1
"once youve rid yourself of history, tradition and religion",1
"What can be said is that it isnt necessarily self-indulgence, haterism or narcissism",1
"Hi, this is Jim Goettler on behalf of Expert Village and this is a video series about managing a political campaign.",1
One of the ways to raise money for a campaign which is often overlooked is using house parties.,1
Now house parties can be as simple as having a video of your candidate or a video about your issue if its an issue campaign.,1
"Available to play in someones home unit, you invite a bunch of friends over, you have some munchies, some food, some drink, and while people are there discussing the issue, you ask them to write a check.",1
"Its known up front what this is all about, theres no mystery involved.",1
But they can also be a lot of fun because it brings people together who generally share ideas and opinions and you can have a really good time at a house party.,1

It’s critical that we pay attention to what is happening to customers and prospective customers in both the B2B and B2C markets.,1
"For one thing, they are being insulated from direct contact with a salesperson more than ever before.",1
Billions of dollars are spent monthly in which the entire transaction happens in cyberspace.,1
"Both consumers and business buyers have learned to research, analyze, price, compare and purchase many of the products, services and business solutions they want online without any involvement by a salesperson.",1

Hows it going everyone? Matt Leighton and welcome back to another video,1
"In this video, were going to be talking about the top three questions you need to be asking your home inspector",1
"Im here in Arlington, Virginia, I have the new Discovery Elementary School behind me",0
Its Arlingtons first new elementary school in over 10 years and its a net-zero energy school,1
Meaning it doesnt consume any extra energy,1
It produces everything it consumes,0
It consumes everything it produces,1
You know what Im talking about,1
Ill put a link in the description below so you can learn a little bit more about Discovery Elementary,1
Lets talk about the top three questions you need to be asking your home inspector,1
"Question number one: what is the biggest safety issue that youre seeing? Guys, youre going to be negotiating a lot of money in the home inspection",1
"It could be thousands of dollars, it could be hundreds of dollars, whatever the case may be, your safety is paramount",1
That should be your top priority,1
And the safety issue might be as small as a couple GFCI outlets or it might be something as large as structure damage or the entire electrical needs to be redone or something of that nature,1
"The absolute first question you need to be asking is, what is the biggest safety concern? Question number two is, what is the biggest monetary fix that you see? What is the biggest monetary item out there? And this one can be a little bit tricky because the home inspector might not know the exact cost but they are certainly going to know the most significant item",1
That is number two,1
If youre buying a house or a townhouse,1
You might have something like 20 - 25 items come up,1
"They could range in value from $20 up to maybe $5,000 or even $10,000",1
Now what I tell people is only focus on the Kevin Garnett items,1
Only focus on the big ticket items,1
"Items that are expensive, that are costly",0
Dont worry about things that are $100 or $50,1
Focus on the things that are thousands of dollars and tackle those first,1
So find out from your home inspector what their thoughts are on the most expensive items,1
"And finally, the third thing you should be asking your home inspector is, Mr",1
"Home Inspector, if this was your house that youre purchasing, what would be your top priority?",1
"Now this is kind of tricky because depending on how you word it, they may not be so inclined to answer",1
They may want to kind of excuse themselves and not get in the way of your purchase,1
"But if you word it correctly, I think they can answer that",1
And I think the goal that question is to take them out of their home inspector shoes and put them into a purchasers shoes,1
"A purchaser mindset, sort of change the framework, change the mindset around",0
"So now that they are no longer the inspector, they are the purchaser",0
And I think that would give a little bit of an insight to see what sort of issues are important,1
And what sort of issues were kind of just put on the report to show that they were just doing their job,1
"Because, lets face it",1
"If your house is perfect and theres nothing wrong with it, the home inspector is still going to find things wrong that will need to be fixed because they need to do their job and show that they are doing something for $500",1
"Because if they give you a report that is empty, that shows everything is good",1
Well then youre just going to think that you wasted $500,1
"So even if youre house is perfect, theyre still going to find issues that are wrong with it",1
So I think those are the top three questions that you need to be asking your home inspector,1
"Safety, monetary value, and then the third question is if they were the purchaser",1
"Hi! Im Thomas from Birmingham, Alabama",1
I needed funds badly for a Condo Down payment for my son,1
"I wait around the mortgage brokers, the waiting process is tedious and my son was worried that he would lose the property",1
"Then, Fast Unsecured got into action",1
"They were able to find 6 unsecured cards for me adding up to sixty-eight thousand five hundred dollars in credit financing one of which was from capital one for $10,000 no interest for six months",0
There was just no way I couldve done it on my own,1
They also revealed to me the BIG SECRET to adding more cash out above the daily limit,1
These are the cards and the unsecured financing that I got from them,1
"7% interest, Capital One $10,000 0% Interest of 6 months, American Express Delta $8,000; JP Morgan Chase $5,500, Wells Fargo, $3,000",1
Im happy with Fast Unsecured,1
Digital has enabled us to go deeper with consumers in a number of ways.,1

You must complete the Spartan Preview before you can meet with an academic advisor and enroll in classes.,1
The 2nd step is attending all of this week’s required sessions in your assigned locations with your small group.,1
You will have two orientation leaders mentoring you and your other group members all week.,1
These student leaders have been in your shoes and have a lot of valuable experience to share with you.,1
Ask them lots of questions!,1

"I want to read to you what it says in 2 peter 3:9 “The Lord is not slack concerning HIS promise as some men count slackness, but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that ANY should perish, but that ALL should come to repentance.” The will of the LORD JESUS is that we are patient, and are patient to call upon HIM and wait for HIS provision, and if we DO He comes through for us.",1

"When you and I talk to people about faith and belief, dont we often hear, I wish I could believe the way you do",1
Implied in such a statement is another of Satans deceptions: that belief is available to some people but not to others,1
"object to project on, yes",0
"And as, when you realize it’s kind of you know, that even you yourself might be involved, responsible, yes",1

"This is Financial Adviser Patrick Munro talking about, what is a defined benefit plan.",1
"In the area of retirement plans, companies have to offer retirement plans to retain and keep a valuable employees.",1
A defined benefit plan is a plan thats been approved by the IRS whereby a company can tax deduct dollars from a paycheck so their employees put it aside for their retirement.,1
Many times progressive employment companies will match the deductions that are taken off the employees paychecks and further enhance their retirement.,1
"This is financial advisor, Patrick Munro, answering the question, who qualifies for an IRA?",1
"Well, in order to get an IRA, you must be a American citizen, gainfully employed with taxable income, and working at a job that has tax deductions, and deducted as source.",1

Hi with monsoons here I am going to give you a few tips on how to take care of you skin during monsoons with home made products.,1
Now one of the things with monsoons is that your skin is a little sticky and also you have a lot of open pores and because of the pollution and humidity you will find that your skin feels a little grey.,1
So what you got to do for that is make yourself a scrub which you can do at home.,0
Take a cup of multani mitti (fullers earth) a cup of sandalwood powder and grate some soap into that and mix it up.,1
Take about half a cup of orange peel crushed up.,1
Keep that in your bathroom and to cleanse your face take a spoon of that mix it water and give yourself a nice scrub on face and neck.,0
Dont forget your neck.,1
Keep it on for about a minute or two and then rinse it off and see your skin glow.,1
This is going to definitely deal with all the dead skin pollution and the open pores.,1
Another thing Id like to tell you for monsoon is that you have to keep your skin scrupulously clean and you will also have to change your cleanser.,1
Because if you are using a heavier cleanser you will definitely have to go for something lighter.,1
A face wash is excellent or you will have to use a light cleansing cream or a light cleansing lotion to clean your face.,1

For those not familiar with Chevron – we’re a global energy company with a market capitalization of about $150 billion.,1
We’re best known for our oil and gas developments in some 25 countries around the world including China.,1
"And for our marketing of petroleum products under the brandname Chevlon, Texaco and Caltex.",1
I’ve been asked to lead a discussion at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin in September around the importance of company culture.,1
When I look at the outside world that Chevron faces today.,1
"We know that there are high expectations from our customers, our suppliers, government and communities where we operate.",1
And it’s very important that a CEO establish the right kind of culture to meet those expectations in the community.,1
"Many of you have started businesses where you focus very heavily on customers, cost, technology, and meeting the financial requirements of the business.",1
But to be successful over the long term.,1
"I think it’s very important for a CEO to establish the right kind of culture, so that you get your results in the right fashion.",1
"Secretary Clinton: We have the technology and know-how that can help people leapfrog to energy that is not only reliable and affordable, but clean and efficient.",1
So let’s go through some EFT and learn how to do this practice,1
We’re going to break it down into really simple steps,1
"Right, set up, tap and right",1
So it’s important with EFT to make sure that you right your issue,1
We’ll use from zero to ten,1
It gives you an idea of how much you’re moving and if you’re making any improvement,1
Zero represents the issues gone and ten represents as the most intense it could get,1
Let’s take an example like a headache,1
"Your headache is pounding, you feel tired and you have head pressure",0
"It’s pretty intense, so let’s give it a nine out of ten",0
The combination of these three factors gives rise to varying degrees of market power,1
"So, what does this mean? Well, it refers to the firm’s degree of control over price",1
"Is the firm a price taker or can it choose its price and if so, how much would changing its price affect its profit? Sounds counterintuitive to you; think of it this way",1
"If you are in a perfectly competitive market, you are just a small firm",1
You cannot set your own price,1
"If you set your own price above the market price, people will just go to everyone else to buy their goods and since they sell same goods, everyone else and there are so many of everyone else, you won’t get anything; there are so many substitutes",1
"So, you won’t want to set your price the lower the market price either",1
Why would you want to? You can earn it at the market price,1
"But if you are a monopoly, you get to set your own price unlike the perfectly competitive firm where you take the market price because that isn’t the market dictating you",1
"So, market power refers to the amount of power you have over prices",0
Market power occurs when there is less competition,1
"So, perfectly competitive firms have zero market power whereas monopolies have lots of market power",1
A firm with high market power also has a very high price inelastic demand curve,0
"For example, in monopoly we have no choice but to buy things that monopoly; there are no substitutes",1
Compare that to a firm which is perfectly competitive; there are so many substitutes all over the place,1
Jesus said some very troubling things regarding our spiritual fruit.,0
"I want to read to you what HE said in Luke chapter 6. “A good tree does not bear bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit, for every tree is known by its own fruit, for men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.",1
"A good man out of the good treasures of his heart brings forth good, and an evil man out of the evil treasures of his heart brings forth evil, for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.” Why this is troubling is because farmers know that a good tree might produce some bad fruit, and many Christians know that there are people in their churches, there are people who they consider brothers and sisters that also produce some bad fruit.",1
"But Jesus said that either you need to make the tree GOOD and its fruit ALL GOOD, or you need to make the tree BAD and ALL its fruit BAD, even if it looks good, it is a deception and its fruit is really bad.",1

Hi Mike Johnson from Vexxt Business Growth.,0
ONe of the problems that retailers have is their **** becoming a commodity.,1
And one way to get away from that is to be outside of any kind of comparison.,1

And we dont want you to be a commodity either.,1

"Hello, this is Ron Paul with your weekly update for July 25th.",1
Imagine you had a pesky neighbor who somehow took out a mortgage on his house in your name and by some legal trickery you were obligated to pay for it.,0
"Imagine watching this neighbor throw drunken parties, buy expensive cars, add more rooms to the house, and hire dozens of people to wait on him hand and foot.",0
Imagine that he also managed to take out several credit cards in your name.,1
"One by one, he would max them out and then use your good name and credit to obtain another credit card, then another and then another.",0
"Each time, this neighbor would claim that he needed the new credit card to pay interest on the other maxed out credit cards.",1
"If he defaulted on those cards, your credit score would be hurt and when you wanted to buy something for yourself, it would be more difficult to get a loan and the interest you paid would be higher.",0
"Imagine that you mulled this over, and time after time, said nothing as he filled out more credit applications so he would not have to default on the other debt taken out in your name.",0
"Meanwhile, another shiny new Mercedes appears in his driveway.",0
At what point do you think you might get tired of this game?,0
"And, even though you are left with no really good options, do you think you might eventually tell him to go ahead and default, just stop spending your money!",0
This analogy demonstrates the position we are in with our government and the debt ceiling.,0
"The government has run up a huge debt in the name of the American people, who are sick and tired of being on the hook for it.",0
There are no really good options left.,0
"Defaulting on a portion of the debt may not be without costs, but it is better than handing the government yet another credit card.",1
The government is using the usual scare tactics to strong-arm the people into going along with more spending.,0
"Remember the rhetoric surrounding the big bailout of October 2008? We were told, not that this would be calamitous for the banks, but for the people, who would continue to experience massive job losses and foreclosures.",0
We were told that the economy would sink into a deep recession if this money was not handed out to too-big-to-fail corporate cronies.,0
"So, after much hand-wringing, leaders from both parties, against unprecedented public outcry, agreed to shower money on the banks and increase the debt.",0
"The banks learned nothing, except that Washington will come to their rescue, no matter what.",0
"&gt;&gt; Well, I believe the answer yes.",1
I believe India can and will become a superpower over the next 3 to What is important is leadership.,1

"I want to apologize to you if I have wronged you in any way, and I want to apologize to you if I have discouraged you in any way in your faith.",1
The messages that I make are for people to repent of their sins and to get right with Jesus.,0
I preach that people repent of ALL their sins so that they may be right with Jesus and be HOLY and PURE before HIM.,0
"I don’t want anyone to be discouraged by my message, the message of repentance, so I want to tell you that NO ONE IS PERFECT.",0
"The devil would have you believe that you know, I just believe that I am perfect and I think that I am good and I think that you are bad, and I think everyone else out there is bad and I think that I am good… THAT’S NOT TRUE.",1
I don’t think that I am good.,1
"I don’t think that I am perfect, and in fact NO ONE is GOOD and NO ONE IS PERFECT, but the condemnation that sends people to hell is NOT that we are not perfect or good, but it is that we never got right with Jesus and repented of our sins.",1
"None of us are good and none of us our perfect, HOWEVER we CAN repent of our sins and let the LORD JESUS PURIFY US because EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE WITH JESUS, do you believe that?",1
"Jesus loves you, and Jesus wants your soul, He is fighting for your soul because He loves you.",1
Jesus has NO please in ANYONE perishing in the lake of fire.,0
"So, I apologize if I discouraged anyone by making you think that you have to be perfect on your own merit, or you have to be good on your own merit, because that is NOT what it is about.",0
"NONE of us are perfect and none of us are good, BUT WITH JESUS ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.",1
"So if I encourage you in anything it’s to get right with Jesus, Jesus KNOWS your heart He KNOWS if you are SERIOUS about repentance, and He knows the people who are just playing games.",1
"Make sure that you get right with Jesus because He loves you, He cares for your soul and He finds NO pleasure in sending anyone to hell.",0
"So go to Jesus He will accept you, He will NOT say; “You’re not perfect, you’re not good, I’m going to cast you out…” That is NOT our Heavenly Father.",0
He loves the whole world and He died for us that we may have eternal life.,1
"It’s NOT by our own merit, it’s NOT by our own goodness, but it’s of how great the LORD JESUS IS.",0

"Now I want to talk about something else that might help you, help your audience to remember you, or a specific part of a speech, or maybe an area thats real important in your speech.",1
Its called a mnemonic device.,1
"A mnemonic device is some kind of statement, some kind of jingle, some kind of rhyme that helps people remember.",1
"An example would be when were talking about daylight savings time, and you cant remember whether youre supposed to turn the clock forward or back; you can spring forward or fall back.",1
My name is Julie Asti Im a Certified Financial Planner with Asti Financial Management and today Im going to talk about how to avoid an IRS audit.,1
The first thing to know for an IRS audit is that really a relatively small percentage of returns ever get audited.,0
Good morning.,1
I am pleased to be here today with my fellow Commissioners from both the SEC and CFTC.,1
"And, I want to thank Chairman Gensler and the CFTC for hosting this first day of joint meetings.",1
We look forward to continuing the dialog tomorrow at the SEC.,1
"I would also like to extend our appreciation to our distinguished panelists who are with us to share their insights, advice, and recommendations.",1
We are truly grateful that so many have agreed to participate in these meetings and share their views with us.,1
"Todays hearing will build upon the progress that both agencies have made in discussing harmonization matters, as well as designing a framework to regulate OTC derivatives.",1
"I believe it will move us further down the road of harmonizing our regulations, which should in turn, help to increase transparency, reduce regulatory arbitrage and rebuild confidence in our markets.",1
"As you know, the Obama Administrations financial regulatory plan laid out proposals that seek to ensure comprehensive regulation of our financial markets and that seek to fill in gaps that came to light in the wake of the financial crisis.",1
One important component of the Administrations white paper - and the reason that we are here today - is a recommendation that we harmonize the existing regulatory regimes for futures and securities products.,1
"Specifically, the Administration asked our agencies to complete a report that identifies all existing differences in statutes and regulations.",1
"Where such differences exist, we must either explain why those differences are necessary or recommend changes to those statutes and regulations.",1
"To advance this important harmonization initiative, we, at the SEC, have been engaging in a continuing dialogue with the CFTC, and staff from both agencies have been developing a coordinated approach to this task.",1
They have undertaken a combined effort to complete a comprehensive evaluation of our regulatory systems to find ways to align the oversight and regulation of similar types of financial instruments.,1
We have made much progress.,1
"We both recognize that enhanced coordination and cooperation concerning issues of common regulatory interest is necessary in order to protect investors, foster market innovation and fair competition and to promote efficiency in regulatory oversight.",1
I am confident that we will also be able to work towards the goals expressed in the Administrations white paper as we seek to build a common foundation for market regulation.,1

"[upbeat music plays] So Im Gerard Brodie, Im the CEO of Consumer Action Law Centre We represent low-income and vulnerable Victorians who are struggling with consumer issues including telecommunications issues",1
"Look I think it varies significantly, there are some people that are more financially savvy maybe have looked around and found that the best offer whether thats often a prepaid offer so they can manage their budgets better",1
"There are others in the community who are, sort of sold the high-end products",1
"They seem good but the salesman can upsell them - the latest phone, the most expensive contract without really realising what theyre signing up to you so we commonly speak to people who have entered into a contract that is expensive or in some way unfair and theyre having problems with that and wanting some advice and assistance",1
"I think affordability often stems from the way in which a particular product is sold sometimes people can receive calls from unsolicited sellers over the phone or even door-knocking, to sell them a particular phone plan or internet plan that seems good at the time but they dont really have the opportunity to think through whether it suits their requirements and a high pressure sale can mean that they sign up without that thinking through and that can become an affordability problem down the track when they realise that the bills are much more than they thought they would be to start off with",1
Look I think that our telcos and our internet providers could do a much better job in their selling practices,1
Id like to see all these providers sort of abolish unsolicited sales and wait for a consumer to approach them and then be there to offer good independent advice about the best offer for someone,1
"Now you see this online with big businesses, things like the Huffington Post or even BuzzFeed",1
"These are almost large business type Super Connectors, that help businesses via their advertising platform, reach out and hit a lot of different people at once",1
"But in real life, you can become a Super Connector, and that can be incredibly beneficial for you, because as a Super Connector, youre gonna find a lot of benefits",1
"The first being, that youre never gonna be out of a job",1
"Super Connectors always have the opportunity to find out about different job opportunities or different ways that they can jump into a new business, simply because, theyre hearing about so many different business fields, but the real key to being a good Super Connector is the fact that whatever you want to promote is usually very easy to do because the people within your social network all owe you favors, as youve been helping connect them",1
So how do you do it,1
How do you become a networker,1
"Well, its pretty simple really",1
"To start with, you need to make sure that youre going out and actually meeting as many people as possible",1
Marketing Guru Philip Kotler perhaps said it best.,1
Authentic marketing is not the active selling what you make.,1
But knowing what to make.,1
This would also be the first step in building a marketing model.,1
"Hi, Im Peggy Collins.",1
And were going to talk a few minutes about how to build a marketing model.,1
The business world is littered with sad stories of people.,1
"Welcome to OptionRally Academy, Im Amy Anderson with the Term of the day.",1

"With the acquisition of HOSTING.com, Quantum expanded our use of the hosting services to manage all of our dedicated servers for internal development, science analysis and, ultimately, production-client hosting.",1
The reason that HOSTING made the most sense for us is that we had a good experience with them at HostMySite.,1
Hello my name is FJ Cava and I have an MBA from San Francisco State University in entrepreneurship.,1
Im also owner of the Bayview Webspot here in San Francisco California.,1
Today Im going to talk to you about how to get a loan just by having bad credit.,0
There are very few ways to get a loan for businesses if you do have bad credit.,1
So the first point of advice is to clear up the credit that is bad.,1
I dont agree with the gender pay gap how the pay between men and women isnt equal.,1
"Hi, Im FBI Director Jim Comey.",1
Thanks for letting me speak with you today.,1
"Fifty years ago today, the Jackson office opened its doors to the people of Mississippi.",1
It was the Freedom Summer of 1964—a watershed moment in the Civil Rights Movement.,1
"As you know, the years before that Freedom Summer were marred by rampant Jim Crow violence.",1
"By 1964, the struggle for civil rights in Mississippi—and across the nation—had reached a fever pitch.",1
"The disappearance of three young Freedom Summer volunteers—James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner—ignited a nationwide outcry.",1
President Johnson and FBI Director Hoover agreed: The FBI was needed in Mississippi.,1
"One hundred and fifty agents were dispatched to the state, the Mississippi Burning investigation began, and the Jackson office was born.",1
"The job was not an easy one for those first employees, who faced threats and hostility from those trying to keep the status quo.",1
"But by the end of August 1964, armed with new legal authorities under the Civil Rights Act—passed just days before the office opened—the Jackson Division had more than 100 civil rights cases.",0
"By October, that number had skyrocketed to 859. Today we mark more than just a 50-year anniversary.",0

"IM NOT SAYING ANYTHING, EXCEPT FOR WHAT IM SAYING RIGHT NOW.",1
"ONE OF YOU GUYS ALREADY STARTED A PETITION BEFORE I KNEW WHAT HAPPENED, I GOT NEWS OF IT TODAY, 37,000 PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY SIGNED.",1
IT IS AMAZING.,0
"CAN I SEE 50,000? 100,000? THE DNC HAS ALREADY SCHEDULED APPROXIMATELY 1000 DEBATES AND TOWN HALLS ON ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA, OLD MEDIA, AND WHEN I SAY OLD MEDIA, IT IS QUITE LITERAL.",0

"During the Great Depression in the mid 1930’s, leading up to the great stock market crash, artists found support through programs such as the Works Progress Administration, or WPA, which included varied activities of the Federal Art Project and the Resettlement Administration and the Farms Security Administration and so on.",0
They provided information to the public about government programs but also about the plight of the people the programs served.,0
"So, if the government wished to sell a social program they found artists who could show the plight of the people in need of such support.",1
Dorothea Lang worked for the WPA in the Resettlement Administration.,1
She was hired to photograph the rural people displaced by the great depression and Migrant Mother Nipomo Valley shows just such a figure.,0
This is a starving migrant mother and her three children at a camp for migratory pea pickers in Nipomo California just down the state from us.,1
"She was a displaced farmer who picked other people’s crops to feed her seven children, three of whom are showed here.",1
"Just before this photograph was taken, and here we get into the context more deeply—we cannot know this from the photograph but it will speak volumes—the crop she was supposed to pick had frozen.",1
"What that meant was that there was no work to be done; if there’s no work, there’s no food.",1
"She had, just before this photograph was taken, sold the tires off of her car to buy food for her children.",0
Now yes or no questions helped the interviewer to establish clarity on details discussed,1
Leading questions help the client to admit to information that otherwise might be withheld,1
"In this example, the client was reluctant to admit that her ex stole from her",1
Leading questions can also help a client to articulate ideas that they cannot express those ideas or do not see them as relevant,1
"However, leading questions suggest an answer and have the potential to decrease the accuracy of the answer",0
Hi everyone! 2016 is almost finished and that seem so crazy to me because it feels like yesterday I was sitting down and talking about the things that Id like to do in 2016,1
So now its time to make that same video for 2017,1
"So here goes, here are the things that I would like to do in 2017",1
I hope you enjoy,1
The first thing I would like to do in 2017 is stop moaning about petty things,1
"Now this would be stop moaning altogether, but I feel like moaning is therapeutic sometimes, it can really help solve a problem",1
But sometimes I find myself moaning about the most trivial things and I think its just because Im bored,0
And deep down I know that Im very lucky and Im very grateful for everything that I have so I should start verbalizing that and verbalizing how grateful I am for things instead of sounding unappreciative,1
"In 2017, Id also like to watch 25 movies that Ive never seen before",1
"Whenever I come to watch a movie, I tend to pick my favorites but maybe its time for me to find some new favorites",1
Theres so many movies out there that Ive never seen before and maybe if I just watched them Id find that I like them very much,1
So Im setting myself the goal of finding 25 new movies for me to watch and lets see how that goes,1
"My next goal for 2017 is something that sounds quite simple, but I think its quite a challenge and I think its something that everybody has to work on, on some level and thats be nice to everybody",1
"Now that sounds quite simple when Im in a good mood, but I want to be more conscious of how I make people feel when Im in a bad mood because sometimes I snap, sometimes Im grumpy, you know, everybody has those moments",1
And being grumpy can be infectious if you answer in the wrong way to somebody,1
"And I dont wanna pass that on, I want the world to be happy",1
So thats just something Id like to do,1
I dont want to be that person that makes somebody feel horrible,1
Id also like to make 12 videos that help,1
12 videos is like one every month or so,1
Because I have various stories and experiences that might help somebody whos going through similar things at the moment So if those videos were to help even just one person then that would totally make this whole thing worth it,1
And the final thing I would like to do in 2017 is something that Im always trying to do and thats visit a place that Ive never been to before,1
And that could be like a foreign country or a city or it could even just be somewhere near my house that Ive never visited before,1
"The possibilities are endless, this is a big world and I feel like I want to experience as much of that as possible",1
"So hopefully that should lead to some good adventures in 2017, who knows? So thanks very much for watching everybody, I hope you had a great 2016 and do let me know down below if you have any goals for 2017 and good luck achieving them! Thanks everyone and Happy New Year",0
The was one New Years resolution that I had for 2016 that I definitely did not achieve and that was to stay in the country,1
"You can check out my vlogs from San Francisco down here, that was the most epic way of breaking a New Years resolution ever! So I hope you enjoy",1
"Thanks everyone, cheerio! Subtitles by the Amara",1
The reason I chose a Loyola executive MBA program is because of convenience and quality.,1
The weekend format allows me to do my job in a leadership role for a local manufacturer who exports machinery all over the world.,1
But exposure to the program and how they use reflection has convinced me to be more structured about that.,1
"That I, I bring it into work activity all the time; after an important meeting we’ll have a reflection: how did the meeting go?",1
"After an important customer visit, we’ll have reflection: how’d the visit go?",1
"And it is a powerful tool, something I learned here at Loyola.",1
"You know, being true to one another, being physically intimate, theyre all beautiful things",1
In this section were going to discuss some methods you can use in dealing with tough customers.,0
A movie star is a working actor thats been elevated to the status of a move star by the public and the fans that watch movies.,1
"Movie stars arent typically made in their first time out of the gate so to speak but they are elevated to the status of a heavenly body as it were by the people that enjoy and appreciate movie, movies in general.",1
"rights against majorities, even down to the village",1
So the Constitution is a charter of liberties that applies against any level of sovereign government,1
And the decision holds that the kinds of activities that are required by the state in the flag salute or Pledge of Allegiance do constitute a violation of the individual liberties of people like the Jehovahs Witnesses,0
DIANA ROBERTSON: I see in Europe that theres so much more environmental consciousness.,1

So why did you want to be a giver?,1
I wanted to be a giver because I wanted to reach light- and non-readers.,1
"And what was your biggest joy, highlight,  or surprise of World Book Night?",1
"The biggest joy for me was to, I went to Oak Park township senior center and Mills Tower and these are, theres another senior center.",1
"Just, you know, seeing the joy after I have handed out the books.",1
Just seeing a big smile on their face.,1
And what information did you share about your book choice when giving books out?,1
My book was The Zoo Keepers Wife: A War Story by Diane Ackerman.,1
Welcome to Crawford Park Financial.,1
I’m Joanna Crawford and Crawford Park Financial is a Hard Money Lender.,1
Today the topic is Business Purpose Loans.,1
"Business purpose is one of the most relevant factors in an investment loan, it can exempt the loan from Section 32 and 35. If the loan is exempt, the Lender’s interest rate can be higher and the Lender and Broker can charge greater fees.",1
Sometimes in schools or with a writing assignment we move towards summative assessments where we just get this snapshot at the end of how students are doing.,1
This is financial adviser Patrick Munro talking about can IRA contributions to Roths be withdrawn without penalty.,1
A Roth by its very nature is an account whereby are prepay by the the contributor.,1
"So that when you hit seventy and a half in age, you are no longer required to pay minimum distributions.",1
Let’s take a quick look at some of these Emotional Budget Busters,1
"The first Emotional Budget Buster is Denial, and, as financial counselors, we hear it every day",1
I manage my finances just fine,1
"” On the wall in my office is a drawing of a large circle, with a tiny dot in the upper right-hand section",1
"The dot, “More than you can ever dream of knowing",0
"there is a lot to know about your finances, and if you think you’re doing ‘okay’, you probably sense that you could still do better",1
What are the current interest rates on all my loans,1
When is the right time to open a new credit account,1
When should I refinance my home,1
"interested in studying international and comparative law to take courses such as emerging markets, international trade, international dispute resolution, human rights, and comparative constitutional law",1

"Career counselors serve as student advisers and coaches, helping students maximize their law school experiences",1
The most critical obligation of the state is to secure its citizens.,1
"You are asking me how I would personally react, if f a criminal entered my house.",1
"As any other human being, I would obviously protect my family by using any means available.",1
"Im Jamal Spencer for Expert Village, here at ABC 3 here in Lansing and were going to talk about how to be a successful sports broadcaster.",1
So often you get sent out to do a story by yourself.,0
"That means you have to report it, edit it, shoot it, all by yourself.",1
They call it backpack journalism.,1
"So when you get to an interviewee and you tell them hey, Im sorry, Im only one man today.",1
Can you help me out?,1
You either hand them the mic or you do it yourself.,1
"Hey everybody, Aaron back again.",1
Today I want to talk a little about commodities and how you can successfully trade them on the binary option market.,1
"If you have only traded stocks, Indices or currencies so far you should really take the time to learn a little more before you dive into this field as commodities behave a little differently, which can have a serious impact on your trade results.",0
"Stocks are impacted mostly by how the company they represent does, cash flow, profit etc.",1
Currencies revolve around the strength (real or perceived) of the countrys finances and indices are also influenced by politics on top of all of those issues.,1
This is Patrick Munro talking about what is the Standard and Poor five hundred.,1
Every beginning investor should know that the Standard and Poor five hundred is the oldest index thats been out there in the United States since the stock market began.,1
"Standard and Poor five hundred is comprised of every industry sector in America and most of the companies that are in the S and P five hundred as its known, are blue chip companies.",1
You may have heard that term blue chip.,1
"Elizabeth Griffin&gt;&gt; Hi, Im Elizabeth Griffin.",1
Im a marine wildlife scientist and fisheries campaign manager at Oceana.,0
Im here in Doha at the CITES meeting.,1
It was a really exhilarating and really exhausting day today.,1
"We started off the day with launching a new paper written by the Oceana scientists in Madrid, and the paper documented the fact that 10 million kilograms a year of shark fins are entering the Hong Kong market.",1
"This is equivalent to the weight of over 2,000 African elephants.",1
Its just an enormous amount of shark fins.,1
"We got a lot of media attention on the paper, including Reuters and AP, and then I was interviewed in a life Al Jazeera interview too.",0
"Ernst &amp; Young LLP has ranked in the top 10 on Working Mothers 2012 Working Mother 100 Best Companies list, and was also inducted into Working Mother magazines Hall of Fame, demonstrating the firms continued commitment to womens advancement and showcasing its programs and policies that benefit working parents.",1

My name is Jean-Pierre Lehman.,1
I am concerned with International political economy.,0
"Ok, I am Tracy Goodwin, and I am the red sweater lady, and I am here to talk to you about humorous interpretation, and youre saying to yourself, what is humorous interpretation?",1
"Well, you might be in a college speech course, or you might be in a toastmasters group, or you might be in high school speech, or you might be looking to do competitive speech, and humorous interpretation is one of the events that you can choose to participate in.",1
People need to agree on what counts as a valid way of answering a question as well,1
Someone might feel that the answer was revealed to him in a dream,1
Someone else might have claimed to have found an answer in an ancient prophecy,1
"But when dealing with scientific questions, it’s important that we’re relying on the rigorous standards of scientific inquiry",1
Consilience of Evidence and Social Calibration are important but still might not be enough,1
"To be really confident that consensus is correct, it also helps to see agreement coming from many different groups from many different backgrounds",1
"In other words, we want to see Social Diversity",1
"To understand why, it helps to look at cases in which a lack of Social Diversity can lead to the wrong conclusions",1
One is plain old bad luck,1
It is always possible to reach a conclusion of “yes” when the answer correctly is really “no” or vice versa,1
It could be a statistical fluke,1
The great gold rush is on and a lot of Americans are getting involved in gold because of the fact that its value is shooting up significantly.,1
"Well, the Klondike, back in the 1897 Gold Rush, was a very important component of mining gold, right out of the stream with a sluice pan and things of that nature, gold miners were staking their fortune back then.",1
Nowadays mining is much more sophisticated.,1
Large mining companies basically strip mine large deposits and where deposits are located.,1
"Strip mining involves using specialized equipment, large earth movers that scrape off various layers of the substrata, and then put it on conveyor belts where it is separated from its substrata looking for the actual ingots or actual raw ore that comes out.",0
It can often be very difficult to differentiate between regular or sort of normal irregular heart beats and one that can be more problematic or dangerous.,0
"Often symptoms that do not go away quickly by themselves or irregular heart rhythms that are associated with chest discomfort, lightheadedness, dizziness, shortness of breath do require and should require additional evaluation.",1
"When a patient presents with an irregular heart rhythm, the first step is actually to get a complete story of the patient and understand what the symptoms are.",1
Hello ACN.,1
Im Andy Andrews.,1
"Im the author of The Travelers Gift and The Noticer, and I am really looking forward to being with you guys in Cleveland this summer.",1

"Technology is changing so fast, Im not gonna predict what’s gonna be the next Twitter or the next Facebook.",1
"I think the broader trend is search, social, and mobility.",1
"Hello, my name is F.J.",1
Jay’s ultimate lesson to me came this past week.,1
When the press release announcing Jay’s death was posted Wednesday night I paused after I read  the link from the KU home page to that news release.,0
"That link read this; it said,  “University Mourns Long-time Employee Jay Turnbull.”  Think about that for a moment.",0
"That headline could just as easily have read,  “University Mourns Son of Distinguished Professors,” or “University Mourns Special Worker.”  Instead the headline points out a simple fact.",1
"That Jay was a person in and of himself,  independent of who his parents were   or whether he had a disability, or did not have a disability.",1
"He was a person who worked for 20 years  and who contributed greatly to the mission of the Beach Center,  the Lifespan Institute, the School of Education, and the University of Kansas.",1
"And in reflecting on that headline and thinking about Jay  and his impact on my life and the lives of others,  I realized that the most important lesson Jay taught me  was not really about the possible lives  that people with severe disabilities tend to lead.",1
Let’s talk about fighting.,1
"This is a story about two rival groups, the Yooks and the Zooks, who eat bread with the butter on different sides of the bread.",0
An elderly Yook explains to his grandson that he has been watching the Zooks for a long time and has met a rival named VanItch.,0
"Soon, it becomes an arms race between the grandfather and VanItch, as each one gets better weapons than their adversary.",1
"Finally, the Yooks create a bomb and send everyone underground.",1
"In the end, the grandfather holds the bomb and is surprised to see that VanItch also has a similar bomb.",1
"As always, a lot can be said about this story, but what draws my interest and attention is the idea of fighting and how one goes about winning a fight.",0
"And this isn’t about arguing and disagreeing, but it’s when the arguing boils over into the physical.",1
"The idea of fighting is interesting because it seems like once you move from the realm of the verbal and enter the realm of the physical, things have the potential to never end.",1
"Unless, of course, you annihilate the entire enemy, and even then, there will always be potential for a new enemy to step in and thus more fighting to ensue.",1
"This story demonstrates how ridiculous and petty fighting, or war, can be and ultimately, the story ends at a standstill with both soldiers holding bombs that will not only destroy each other, but both cities and civilizations.",1
And that’s not to say that war or fighting is not necessary.,1
"Unfortunately, some injustices can only be settled with the physical.",1
"But it’s when these grander scales between nations are shrunken down to the schoolyard, that’s where things can become socially jumbled.",1
The dividend yield ratio measures the percentage of a stock’s market value returned annually to the stockholders in the form of a dividend.,1
Preferred stockholders pay special attention to this ratio because they invest primarily to receive dividends.,1
"Hi, Im Mark, HEY - I just attended Anthonys YouTube Video Seminar and, WOW I really learned a lot",1
It Gave me a lot of thought provoking ideas,1
"Im a Real Estate Broker, I dont do the videos but, I want to learn",1
"O.k., lets talk for a minute about time limit.",1
In this clip well talk about how many days your convention or event should be.,1
"next going to take one of your normal sized chocolate chips, and you are also going to dip this into the melted chocolate chips",1

-Exactly -And now we have finished our squirrely fall treat,1

"I’m sorry I couldn’t join you today, as it is a sitting week in Canberra",0
"But I want to thank you as well for all the work that many of you have done, over a number of years, to deliver the very first White Paper for Developing Northern Australia at the Commonwealth Government level, and the record investments we are making in Northern Australia",1
I am only standing on the shoulders of those who came before me as the Minister for Northern Australia,1
"People like Ian Macdonald, who’s played a great role down here, but people also like Allan Dale, who’s been involved for so many years on the Developing Northern Australia agenda",1
And I want to thank Allan and his team for once again putting together a very important conference with a great array of speakers to talk about what we do next for developing the North,1
"Over the past year, we have been very focused on delivering for Northern Australia",1
"We have announced 700 million dollars of road funding, for beef roads, for the Northern Australian roads program",1
"And we’ve also announced that we’re going to seal the Outback Way, the first time a government has made a commitment to deliver only the third sealed road between our East-West connections across Australia",1
"We’ve also established the five billion dollar Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, and it has a strong pipeline of projects",1
Over sixty projects are under consideration for it as well,1
We continue to make advancements on the water agenda,1
"As you would know at this conference, more than 60 per cent of Australia’s rainfall falls in Northern Australia, and we have a number of studies out looking at what we do next to better harness those resources, including CSIRO studies we announced a couple of years ago that are due back within the next year",1
That will be exciting,1
"‘Cause now that we are hard delivering on a lot of this agenda, we do need to think about the next steps we take to continue to build on the momentum we have here at the Federal Government level that will rely, and continue to require, people like yourself to be that loud voice up there in the North, so down here in Canberra we hear how important developing the North is – not just to you, not just to the people who live in Northern Australia, but also to the advancement of our country as a whole",1
"Because developing Northern Australia is not about just helping Australians who live in Northern Australia, it is also about making sure that we deliver the best result for our country, that we do develop all of our resources around this great country that we have, and Northern Australia already has played a big role in our history and has even perhaps a greater contribution to make to our future",1

What exactly IS a Health Insurance Exchange?,1
"An Exchange is, to put it simply, like a typical online store, but instead of it being a place to buy clothing or gifts or music, its one where you buy Individual and Family Health Insurance plans.",1
"Specifically, plans which meet the coverage requirements under The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.",1
There are two basic types of Exchanges.,1
"One is a Public Exchange, built and run by either the state government in which it operates, or it is built and run by the federal government on behalf of the state in which it operates.",0
"The other kind of is a Private Exchange, which is the same concept, a website in which you can buy an Obamacare-qualified health plan, but it is built and run by a private company.",1
What we need is not to change democracy and find another form of government.,0
"There is no escape from the party system, that the parties compete among themselves as to who will represent the principle of social justice and the other principles, and people will then choose democratically between them.",0
The question here is that we need to change direction in terms of everything connected to the conception of economics and society.,1
There were two sacred cows in Israel.,0
The first is the defense budget and the second is privatization and the market economy.,0
These are two disasters that harmed the weakest classes and harmed equality.,0

"These are going to be actual Canadian employers, coming to the region, looking for employees with specific job experience, who are interested in immigrating to Canada for these jobs",1
"The job fair is actually sponsored by the Canadian Government and specifically, the Government of New Brunswick, which is one of the provinces in Canada, on the East Coast",1
They are looking for families and for people who are interested in immigrating to New Brunswick,1
"The specific job experience that they’re looking for is: food service supervisors and managers, home support workers, process control operators and food and beverage processing",1

You’ll also need to get any education that you have accredited by an organisation that’s recognised by the Canadian Government,1
"You’ll also need proof of work experience, so a letter of employment from your previous employer and also have sufficient savings",1
"So, for an individual this is approximately 3 000 Dollars Canadian that you need to show that you have in your bank account",1
"So, if you have these eligibility requirements and you have work experience in one of the jobs that I’ve mentioned, then you should register",1
"You’ll see in our Facebook posts, there is a link to the website that you can go to register for this event",1
"The event is actually an employer driven event, which means they’re going to have an information session but then they’re actually going to be conducting interviews after so make sure you come prepared with all of your documents, your CV and your other supporting documents with you",1
And be ready to also do an interview,1
They’re going to be creating an inventory of employees for this event which then they will use for events going forward,1
"So, even if you do not get an invite or get a job through this event, you will then be on the register and may get invited to a later event, later in 2017 or in 2018, so it’s very important to register",1
"If you haven’t got your education accredited or haven’t got your IELTS exam completed yet, start the process now and bring that documentation with you to the event so that you can show the people when you arrive that you have started the process",1

Pi manages to keep himself separated from the other animals and can only watch as the hyena kills the zebra and orangutan.,1
"Pi fears that he will be killed next, but the tiger kills the hyena.",1
"Pi decides to build an adjoining raft that is connected to the lifeboat by rope and luckily finds survival supplies, such as food and water.",1
"Instead of waiting for the tiger to die, Pi decides he must train the tiger to ensure his own personal survival.",1
"Pi learns to fish and begins feeding the tiger, slowly training and taming him.",1
"As food and water supplies dwindle, Pi struggles with health issues, like sores and dehydration.",1
He also becomes temporarily blind.,1
Pi encounters another blind man who is also floating on a boat.,1
"However, the man comes aboard and the tiger eats him.",1
"When Pi’s eyesight returns, he sees an island in the distance.",1
He arrives on the island and finds algae that he can eat.,0

Being a conservative and being a Republican align but not fully,1
Being a conservative is what i consider myself first,1
I support the rights to freedom on all levels,1
That means I get the right to choose however I want to live my life and Im not going to govern and legislate to make sure im coming into your life to tell you how to live,1
The Republican platform is the one that aligns closely with what I believe and thats why im a Republican,1
I think a big part of being a republican is wanting a smaller government role,1
"I think, especially in like a globalized society with all these huge issues, I really think government needs to be well equipped to deal with all the problems that can arise",1
What it means to be a Democrat as I understand a lot of the party is focused on diversity but often I see diversity of skin color and not so much diversity of thought which is most concerning to me because at the end of the day we should be judged by whats in our mind and the contents of our character rather than the color of our skin,1
Being a Democrat means fighting for equality,1
Being a Democrat means you stand up for people whose voices might not be heard as loudly as others,1
"FELICE FRANKEL: Hey, everyone",1
This is our first video update,1
We are now starting week one of the course,1
I think that what well probably say now more than anything else is a quick conversation about the equipment,1
Many of you are concerned that Im being a little too picky in what Im requiring of you,1
"Now, first of all, I am not requiring anything of you",1
What Im doing is showing you what I do and my technique,1
My hope is that youll like what I make-- the images that I make-- and follow my lead,1
And for the most part the exercises that weve developed really are intended to be used with a 105 macro lens on a camera that can take lenses,1
"It is not going to work for you if you are going to just use a snap and shoot, or whatever you call it these days",1
"You really want to meet the standards, if I could say that, that we are suggesting you pay attention to",1
"It is true that you can, on occasion, use extension tubes instead of-- for example, lets say you dont have as much of a macro lens as youd like",1
And so you can use tube extensions as long as they dont have any glass,1
"But youll be losing f-stops in the process, and youll find out more about aperture and f-stops in the oncoming weeks",1
"So those of you who are technically savvy, I hope that youll find what our exercises have become developed into",1
And the ideas in the course will be appropriate for your needs as well,1
"But just getting back to the equipment, for example, when we get up to using a camera and a lens, which is in a week two, youre going to see that Im going to suggest using software",1
"And youll probably say, why is she doing that? Well Id like to hope that Im going to be making a case for that",1
"So in the end, please consider following what were suggesting",1
It works for me,1
And my hope is that what works for me is going to work for you,1
"But this coming week, were going to have more fun in the sense that youre not aware that hard, because youre going to be using a flatbed scanner and youre going to be a bit shocked at some of the wonderful images you can get from that",1
"So in any event, we hope were going to create something wonderful for you",0

This new heavy-lift rocket will be America’s most powerful since the Saturn V rocket that carried Apollo astronauts to the moon.,1
"It will launch humans to places no one has gone before, such as asteroids, Mars and other deep space destinations.",1
"In combination with the crew capsule already under development, commercialization of astronaut travel to low-Earth Orbit, extension of activities on the International Space Station, and a fresh focus on new technologies, this rocket is key to implementing the plan laid out by President Obama and Congress.",1
"President Obama challenged us to be bold and dream big, and thats exactly what we are doing at NASA.",1
"While I was proud to fly on the space shuttle, tomorrows explorers will now dream of one day walking on Mars.",1
"This launch vehicle decision is the culmination of a months-long, comprehensive review of potential designs to ensure that the nation gets the best possible rocket for the investment, one that is not only powerful, but is also evolvable so it can be adapted to different missions as opportunities arise and new technologies are developed.",1
The rocket will use a liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen fuel system.,1
RS-25D/E engines will provide the core propulsion and the J2X engine is planned for use in the upper stage.,1
There will be a full and open competition to develop the boosters based on performance requirements.,1

"A variable annuity, just like the word implies, variable is Wall Streets version of what an annuity should be.",0

The problem is that mutual funds are of have the following rules attached to them.,1
"...people with disabilities, because golf is the ultimate rehabilitation tool.",1
"If we can get people with disabilities to try the game, and convince them that they can do something that they think they couldnt do before, that establishes the mindset that, If I can do this, what else can I do that I couldnt do before? Thats the first step to getting them back into the mainstream of society and off of public assistance.",1
"I think that this whole initiative benefits the game of golf because we want the sport to look like a snapshot of America, and you cant have a snapshot of America without the disabled population being involved.",1
"Our underlying tenet has always been to work with all people, and bring them into the game of golf and more importantly, keep them into the game of golf.",0
"This is one population - people with disabilities - that has not been tapped in the industry, and with our over-reaching goal in the industry, Golf 2020, to reach and to grow the game of golf.",1
"This is a group of 54, approximately 54 million people that we, as a group, are focusing on.",1
This is a tremendous initiative for growing the game of golf and in growing the game of golf with inclusion for all.,1
"...because we, as a golf industry, just like any other recreation industry struggle with keeping our industry vital, and increasing the numbers of people who participate in our sport, and really, there are a lot of golfers in America who are considered to be disabled who want to play the game of golf.",1
"We know that there are many who are already playing the game, but there are many who, for different reasons, have not taken up the game.",1
"Either its because they are not aware that there are special assistive devices that help them play the game, or theyre intimidated much like a beginning golfer might be of going to the golf course.",0

"Today, there are over 40 million Americans who have about 1.2 trillion dollars in student debt, what do you think is the best way to help borrowers who are struggling the most with paying off their loans?",1
"Okay, for openers, the United States Congress should refinance student loan debt.",1
"To just bring down, at a minimum, bring down the interest payments on those loans.",0
"You know, this is whats really appalling is its set up right now so that the United States government makes a profit off the backs of people who have to borrow money to go to school.",0
And Ill just give you one example of that.,1
"After you account for the bad debt losses and the cost of the funds and the administrative cost — just one section of loans, the section that went out between 2007 and 2012, we just happen to have good numbers on these — are now on target to produce $66 billion in profits for the United States government.",1
"If the government would let students refinance their loans the way you can refinance your house, when interest rates are low or businesses refinance their loans when rates are low, if we would do that, we would literally save billions of dollars over time for people who have to borrow money to go to school.",1

"I started out doing very traditional research, looking at how consumers behave in traditional retail settings.",1
"So when they go into a store how they respond to marketing stimuli like prices, advertising, displays and things like that.",0
How do they make the brain choices that they do?,0
How do they consume products?,1
How do they choose among different retailers?,1
So really essentially problems of choice and in very traditional settings.,1
"And then I would say, perhaps in the last four or five years, Ive now got really interested in internet retailing and how people connect over the internet, people connect from different communities.",1
Because I think a traditional retailing you face two constraints.,1
So constraint number one is once you locate a store in a certain region youve really defined youre trading area.,1

"When investing in a tax-free mutual fund, its going to be important to take a look at the taxes and how theyre going to be handled.",1
"For example, not all tax-free mutual funds that youre going to buy are going to be free from federal, state and local taxes.",1
"If you live in California and you buy a tax-free New Jersey bond fund, you are going to be possibly depending on the type of fund exempt from federal taxes but because you live in California and not New Jersey the interest income from that fund is still going to be subject to state and local taxes.",0

"consumers, theyre every bit as robust as any other country in the world.",1
&gt;&gt; Theres been a question about what the most significant innovation or development are likely to be over the next decade and I would hazard that there are two areas that need this innovation more than any other.,0
The first is energy.,1
"We arent nearly sufficient in respect of clean, sustainable forms of energy.",1
"You know theres been broad discussions at Copenhagen, unfortunately insufficient to reach agreement on how to bring down the level of CO2 emissions.",0
But it does lay the basis for innovation in respect to energy.,1

"You ask about how the behavior of a person who may experience disability  following a brain injury, may be misinterpreted.",1
It can be misinterpreted many ways.,1
"We talk about problems of awareness for people who experience disability following brain injuries, and  I see awareness as a person cant perceive, understand, and react to a situation like other people in that situation do.",1
It doesnt take a brain injury to have a lack of awareness.,1
"You walk into the wrong party, you walk into the wrong situation,  and youre not going to know all the factors and youre going to be sort of the odd person out.",1
But we also have to talk about people and programs who are trying to work with that individual about their lack of awareness.,0
"And what I mean by that, they dont understand how the person of focus is understanding the situation.",1
"And much as we talk about the person who may experience disability following a brain injury not getting it because they dont understand the context of the  situation or the goals and everything,  those of us who are trying to help that person, we have to understand the world as that person sees it.",0

"In todays video, Ill be talking about creating your Seven Essential Keys to Achieving Financial Intelligence",1
Its a known fact that most Australians in todays society are time poor,1
Many are too busy fulfilling their simple daily tasks to even consider attending the necessary home work required to know whether their financial investments are on the right track,0
For most there money simply placed in savings or term deposit accounts that provides them with the illusion of security when they go to bed at night,1
In truth all that its really doing is providing them with a place to store their money whilst providing them with minimal returns,0
"Others place their money into risky investments, to make up for all the years they didnt contribute to there super savings",1
Others simply seem to play a game of Russian Roulette with their futures,0
"None of which is financially smart moves, but which many have done and you know theyve either been told by friends of being successful or simply they require no extra time or effort from their own busy lives already",0
Australians are notorious for under estimating estimating how much funds they need or are likely to need in their retirement years,1
"Their retirement seems a distant reality, until they wake up one morning and realise retirement is just around the corner and theyre going to need a lot more money than theyve saved",1
"By then however its probably too late and, living in the luckiest country on earth wont mean anything when the government coffers are empty",0
Then theres the issue of Insurance or more accurately the inadequate levels of Insurance,1
"The truth is the lack of insurance or inadequate Insurance cover, is one of the worst pit falls when it comes to protecting personal wealth and the wealth required to maintain your lifestyle",1
"We seem to take more pride in material objects such as Insuring our cars, our homes, even our iphones rather than the ones that we love or worst still our own lives",1
"Sadly many dont see the importance of Insuring their partners, family or even ourselves",1
"We simply take on the attitude that nothings gonna happen to us and if it does well deal with it then ,when it happens",0
"Protecting your lifestyle is important for many, many reasons",1
"You want to have more options later in life, you want to live comfortably, you dont want to be dependent on the government handouts, you want to travel, enjoy the world and enjoy yourself",1
"Sadly whilst this sounds good, many Australians are failing to make it a reality",1
"Perhaps you have a well paying job, you might be thinking that there is nothing wrong about that",1
"However, it only takes one simple event, only one for all that to be changed in an instant",1
This video is designed to get you prepared for whatever life throws your way,1
"We believe many Australians leave themselves financially exposed and, dont take advantage of their financial opportunities",0
"We want to help, Ok",1
We want you to revisit and polish up on the fundamentals,1
"Much of what youll learn about finance is not rocket science, but there are many conflicting opinions on the topic and so people tend to choose the easy route, do nothing",1
Ok the truth is you have to be smarter that that,1

I had the opportunity to talk to a lot of Saskatchewan people this summer,1
And you know increasingly theres sort of these anecdotal stories of how our economy is improving even in the face of of ongoing challenges like low commodity prices,1
"And now theres been some statistical reinforcement of those anecdotal stories, some evidence",1
StatsCan building permits showed Saskatchewan led the nation in terms of building permit growth 28 per cent,1
Were leading in terms of the pace of growth of manufacturing sales,1
"And thats manufacturing in food processing, machinery manufacturing, chemical processing",1
"And just today new car sales, new vehicle sales are up in Saskatchewan 6",1
There are still many challenges ahead,1
coined in the 1980s to refer to the practice of changing sides from public to private sector in the same area of activity,0
"For instance, high military officers in the United States retired early to take well paid positions in the arms manufacturing companies they used to supervise",1
(iv) Certain forms of trading in influence and conflicts of interest,0
“Conflicts of interest” arise whenever private and public interests are in tension with each other in one and the same person,1
"Auditors and accountants have expressed concern to the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) that auditors consulting businesses are producing a conflict of interest, in addition to worries that other conflicts are compromising audit quality.",0
We have just had a wonderful conversation,0
I want to just tell you a little bit about why we did this,1
I think sometimes in celebration of Dr,0
"What companies are trying to do, is they’re trying to take five or ten or 20 different markets and put it all under one umbrella and assume that the same kind of business model will work in every situation, when in fact it doesn’t.",1

"Fixed annuities are a great investment for folks to consider investing in, because you have the power of triple compounding.",1
"Really, youre able to put money away and it begins to compound; therefore, youre making money on your own money.",1
"Because its in an annuity, you dont have to pay taxes on the internal rate of growth, so you get another layer of growth inside the annuity; that its not worn down by the fact that you have to pay taxes on it.",1
"Hi, my name is Michelle.",1

"In the Middle East in this year’s report we see that… in particular the Gulf States have improved in comparison to the rest of the region, where many countries have actually lost competitiveness.",1
This has been a trend that we have observed for about 5 years.,1
So when you look at the results going about to 2005 we see that that’s where the strength has started.,0
Why have the Gulf States gone up this year?,1
"One of the reasons that the Gulf States have gone up this year, improvements in the macro economic environment but also improvements in the institutional environment in these countries.",1
and this is actually a result of longer term policies on those countries.,1
The oil revenues in these countries have enabled them to stabilize the macro economies and to conduct a number of important economic reforms that led to an improvement of competitiveness.,0
"Iran and Lebanon from Middle East have been added to the rankings this year, people might be surprised to see that Iran is at number 69 mid table.",0

Learning at Harari got my son accepted to Columbia University!,1
"He took AP English, both of them, AP World History and AP Latin and it was an incredible experience.",1
It was the first time he really waited for classes to begin.,1

Probably one of the most difficult things for board members to really fully understand is the concept of inter-generational equity.,1
"What really is that and, more importantly, particular as you deal with an institution many times led by people who are going to be shorter term people.",0
"Remember, the relationship of the foundation is much longer term in terms of its support than the leadership of any one time of its partner institution.",1
They all want to deal with the point that I made earlier when I said one of the things that is important about foundation is to provide maximum sustainable support.,1
And so they emphasize on the word maximum as opposed to the word sustainable. And sustainable is the key element in there because of the concept of inter-generational equity.,1
"What that means is while youve got money that you have today for todays generation of students you, particularly when youre managing endowments which are special kinds of funds that are handled by foundations where you invest them over the long term and only spend the earnings from those endowments.",0
"ey everybody, so today I want to do a quick review of Fall Out Boys new single Immortals which is being released for the Big Hero 6 movie soundtrack.When I think of Big Hero, I think of Guitar Hero, maybe because they have the word Hero in it.",1
I always found it funny that Fall Out Boy was considered pop punk because hwne i think of pop punk i think of Green Day I think of Blink 182 and I think those bands have a harder sound than Fall Out Boy has.,0
That being said this is probably the biggest departure weve seen from Fall Out Boy in recent history or the bands history all together.,1
They dont sound like a punk band or pop punk because this is like if Fall Out Boy went to the EDM category or got someone like Steve Aoki to produce this single because if you didnt hear Fall Out Boys lead singers voice in it you would probably wouldnt be able to recognize that its a Fall Out Boy Song.,0
"And also theres not very much guitars going on, so its muted in that sense.",0
Theres an electronic drum machine going on the whole song and it just has a souless kind of feeling And also just overall its a very poor song.,0

Hey Guys! Im Sara and I decided to create this channel to document my journey through amateur radio,1
I first got interested in the hobby my freshman year of college when a lot of the new friends that I had made were involved,1

"My study placement that I undertook was at Bilkent University in Ankara, I studied Politics and International Relations there which I do back at Aston.",1
"Bilkent University is a top rank University  in Turkey and I was shown through the diverse amount of modules that were available for me to choose from, things like International Relations in Movies - where we had to watch movies in lectures and then do essays about that - something that you wouldnt have been able to do back in Aston.",1
"And it was interesting to learn Politics and International Relations through a different cultural perspective, because the way they taught the same modules that I would have done back at Aston was very very different, the way they taught it but it still was as interesting and I learned just as much as I did back at Aston.",1
"The student body in Bilkent is very very diverse with students coming from all over the world, from different communities and different backgrounds and it was nice for everyone to mesh together to form like a family and everyone just got along really well.",1
"Living in Turkey and being at Bilkent and living in Turkey... I gained so much experience, so much independence and I was able to prove to myself that I can live in a country by myself.",1

Hi this is Ryan Tapp on behalf of Expert Village and this is smack talking through broadcasting.,1
Although smack talking through broadcasting will use the same general tools that you would use when smack talking through technology.,1
It is not the same thing you see when you broadcast you smack talk using broadcasting you are really just humiliating your opponent in front in a large audience where as through technology it was more using the technology to sike them out.,0
In this section well be discussing another model known as the ABCs of customer service.,0

"So, you are interested in possibly filling out a Walmart application right?",1
"Well, you have come to the right place.",1
"I don’t work for Walmart, nor am I hired by them to make this video.",1
"Although working for Walmart is a positive choice, I’m sure you agree it’s best to be properly prepared before you go ahead and rush to fill out the Walmart application form.",1
"I hope that by using my non-biased information, so you can make an informed decision before filling out your job application form.",1
"After you watch this short video, you can find all my research I have gathered for you at walmartjobsguide.com.",1
The link is listed just below this video in the description area.,1
Here are just a few important things to make note of when applying to Walmart.,1
• Walmart does not provide a printable job application.,1
You must apply online which I provide the link on my website.,1
"• Some of the common positions at Walmart are a greeter, cashier, store associate, customer service, trust driver, tire sales, automotive technician, beauty sales, assistant store manager, pharmacist, optometrist and many others which I list on my site.",1
• You must be 16 years old.,1
"So, another question that I often get asked is How do you become a motivational speaker?",1
And I think its an interesting thought.,1
I dont think anybody actually becomes a motivational speaker without one major thing and that is desire.,1
"It is not something that comes easy in the sense, I dont mean that your desire doesnt come easy, but I think once you have that desire the pursuit of actually becoming a motivational speaker, a speaker that draws an audience, is something that can be difficult and it can be trying.",0
So relationships are absolutely key to our business.,1
We’re in a high service arena.,0

She unfortunately passed away some weeks later with her battle with her illness,1

Hey everybody Chris the English teacher here,1
"Today, I want to teach you guys about three different expressions that American English speakers use to say how are you basically",1
"The first one is whats up? We use whats up?, and it kind of means Whats happening so for example if I say whats up? The other person will say, Oh not much",1
Im just hanging out here,1
The correct response is going to be not much,1
"We never ever say fine or good After whats up? Next we have hows it going? Hows it going? is one that basically means How are you? or How is your life going? Here you would respond, Oh, its fine",1
"Im okay etc Finally we have whats going on? Whats going on? is basically the same thing as whats up?, so here again We would respond not much",1
"Remember in American English, When you see somebody and they ask you, like, how are you? Whats up? Hows it going? This is not a time to talk about like depressing stuff",1

"So, you need to decide whats right for you.",1

Ill try to do an update video in the future when Im down with med school and I wanna make two disclaimers before I end the video,1
So the last thing about an Accordion has to do with prices.,1
A brand new instrument can cost certainly several hundred dollars.,1
Sometimes several thousand dollars for a new instrument and your probably not going to be to interested in that till you really become a player and you decide you want a quality instrument.,1
"For a used instrument, depending on where you buy one from, if you get an Accordion from an Accordion dealer that has gone through it and has cleaned it and has gone through adjusted all the reeds and it has been tuned and somebody who knows what they are doing.",1

We help the states to implement their obligations towards all human beings and their countries,1
Independence is essential to our legitimacy,1
One of the things that we need to do is to make critique of governments and we need to be held to account by society and by the international community,1
In order for us to do that effectively we need to be independent and we need to be perceived to be independent,1

The thing that excites me the most about the future is the use of data that were gathering.,1
"If you think about what we do: we install card access,  censors,  video sensors, burglar alarm sensors... their gathering reams and reams and reams of data was just sitting there not being used  unless something bad happens, and we need to do a forensic look at it.",1

I seriously considered buying a turnkey,0
"I went through the process of an initial interview, talked on the phone with a turnkey company—really a great experience",1
"They gave me a ton of information, showed me examples of some properties, what returns would be, you know, all the costs they consider—maintenance, vacancies—all of that, taxes, insurance",1
"But ultimately it came down to, I‘m still able to buy properties in my area in Colorado 20 percent below market value, and I can usually get between 15 and 20 percent cash on cash returns",0
"So, for recruiters that may be new to recruitment marketing, every one of you has a tool that has incredible visibility, even today, that is one of your leading recruitment marketing tools that you may not even be aware of, and that’s job descriptions",1
"Job descriptions are sadly, one of the least involved tools in our recruiting playbook",1
"Though they’re one of the resources, one of the recruitment marketing vehicles have done right, that have more reach than most anything we do",1
"So, instead of taking that template job description off the shelf and reusing that for your next hire, you know, look at the job description, look for opportunities where you can actually tweak that and make that more appealing to the audience you’re trying to connect with",1
"A lot of ATSs these days actually have increased some of their functionality so you can do things like embedding photos and images inside of job descriptions, embedding videos, adding hyperlinks",1
All these things will make your job descriptions more appealing to job seekers,1
"It’ll help you tell the story that you’re trying to tell beyond just the core duties and responsibilities of that job description, and bring them to life even more which will ultimately help you create a more informed applicant and attract the right applicant",1
Another thing that you should really consider is the copy of the job description,1
"This to me is really one of the biggest things that hold recruiting organisations back, because again, you rely on old templates that were likely written by a hiring manager, that’s an unrealistic laundry list of responsibilities and qualifications, and it’s something that a job seeker is not going to want to take the time to go through, particularly a passive job seeker, and even more particularly, a passive job seeker or any job seeker who is looking at that job description on a mobile device, which, for many organisations, is more than half of your potential audience, is reading that job description",1
"So, when you’re re-thinking the copy of that job description from a recruitment marketing standpoint, think about copy",1
Write your job description as if it’s mobile first,1
"Assume that your ideal applicants are going to be viewing that on a mobile device, so you need to make it lean, and then, when you’re actually working on the copy, instead of using terms like “we, our, me,” use terms around “you",1
” Frame the job description around the actual reader,1
Allow them to see themselves in that job,1
"Use “you, your, and yours,” so a reader can actually see themselves in that role, and, when you’re writing the role, don’t write it from a compliance standpoint so that it’s just written in a way that checks all the boxes but doesn’t actually compel me to apply; write that job description as if you’re sitting across the table from your very best candidate",1
"How are you conveying that job to them in a way that’s going to get them excited and help you close them? That spirit is what you should be taking into the job description and into the copy that you’re writing, to actually build something that is going to actually compel people to convert, and in this case conversion will be applying to that actual job",1

"First, this is, probably, the most useful presentation style for almost all of your situations.",1
"Whether it be at work or whether it be in a classroom setting, those settings are moderate in formality.",1
That is one of the reasons why extemporaneous speaking is the best choice because its not too formal and its not too casual.,1

"Well, the class was to be ended up by, I set the class up to be a three-hour class and I was going to deliver some extra information and I figured that after about an hour, hour and fifteen minutes, I would give the class a break to use the restroom and then I would finish up the class.",1
"Well, sure enough the first break comes and the class coincidentally, and we still up to this date, dont know why, was majority women and sure enough on the first break, I had a lady who is English, she had an English background and spoke with an English accent, come up to tell me that my zipper had been down during the first hour and fifteen minutes of the class.",1

Your teacher in that scenario will have a higher status than you,0

But I had no idea who even buys jewelry in San Diego.,1
"So I got my 21-year-old to go online and do some research, and he came back with San Diego Jewelry Finders or Buyers, San Diego Jewelry Buyers.",1
"He said that he did similar to like a Zagat, and that they were the best out of all of them in San Diego.",1
"And because the kids are good with computers, I believed him.",0
"So we ended up making an appointment, came down, met a guy named Timothy, who is a gemologist.",1
"I had some other pieces that I was thinking about maybe selling, but a lot of them were family heirloom type jewelry.",1
This one is one of them.,1

In this video you’re going to discover what a marketing trip wire is.,1
"Before I get into that, if you’d like to know some advanced insider tactics that people are using right now to get 248% ROI on their ads, I’ve got a special video for you, just click the link that’s below right now.",0
"Marketing trip wire is basically a low ticket product offering that solves a specific problem in your prospects life, and you put it at such a low price and you add such high value to it, that it becomes an irresistible offer.",1
"And really what it’s meant to do is just take people that are prospects that have just opted in on your email list and haven’t bought anything, and turn them into buyers as quickly as possible.",1
"Because once somebody has opened up their wallet and bought from you, then you have a much higher chance of selling them other things on the backend.",1
"So that’s why you’ll see a lot of funnels these days will start with like a $7-$17 product and then they move people up the chain to higher products because once they’ve bought from you, they’ve gotten to experience the value that you can provide to them, with very low resistance, then they’ll develop that trust with you and their willing to buy some of your higher end products from you down the road.",1
One thing that you need to understand is that online advertising is becoming increasingly difficult to pull off successfully using the traditional methods because people are simply becoming blind to them.,1
The most effective way to combat this is using native advertisements which is just a fancy term for ads that look similar to the content around them.,1
"It sounds counter-intuitive, but the best way to get noticed is to actually blend in.",1
Think of soap operas and infomercials.,1
"They are the original native ads and have been running successfully for decades, selling billions of dollars of products.",1
"Now if you want to start leveraging native ads, there’s two choices you can make.",1

"Hi there, Seb here, and if you are looking for tips on Total Life Changes business cards and some tips on how to use them you are definitely in the right place and if you want some more training on hot to build your TLC business and generate some more sales you can go on my website here at any time but in this video I wanna give you some tips that will help you to get more contacts for your business and expose your business to more people",1
"So my favourite place to order business cards is Vista Print, a very reliable company, they haven�t failed me yet",1
I�ve had tons of orders through them they have served me for years,1
I would recommend ordering through Vista Print and there is a link in my video description inbox if you haven�t actually got a link already of where to buy business cards,1
Now the next thing we do is that we network locally in order to hand these business cards out,1
Go to networking functions,1
Look locally and see if there is anything for local business owners,1
"There must be something in your area or maybe you have to travel a bit but it�s definitely worth networking, gong to these events at least once a month",1
"Now the problem is, most networkers in TLC and other companies, they will go into these networking events and they will just throw up information",1
They will find any living breathing soul and just tell them all about their business,1
"This is the wrong way to go about it, you want people asking you what you do and you wanna make it interesting so instead of you saying, �I am a distributor in TLC,� what you wanna say is, �I get paid�",1
"� Maybe you can say something like this, �I get paid to help people lose weight",1
� So that�s actually quite interesting and then people can ask you more and you just tell them but in snippets of information,1
"And they will say well, how does that work then? And you would say, �well one we help customer lose X amount of weight in X amount of time",1
"� And you keep it short and sweet because the shorter you keep it, less is more especially in networking",1
You want people asking you questions and you are able to just give them small snippets of information and if they are really interested then you can have them take a look at your website or video or something like that,1
Now the next thing you wanna do is actually personalize these Total Life Changes business cards,1
"My favourite thing to do, I�m not actually in TLC by the way, I�m in another company but my favourite thing on flyers that I hand out for my network marketing business is, I like to put my picture on the flyer, so when I speak to this person and we have a conversation, they�ll take the flyer home, they�ll see my picture and the rapport is kind of regained because they will actually�",1
They will remember me just from seeing my picture,1
They remember that conversation,1
That can be a real great way to personalize and also stand out from the crowd,1
Now the final thing you wanna do is gather as many business cards as possible,1
I didn�t want this to happen but this is probably the most important thing you should do and then follow up with these people afterwards,1
"Give them a call and just ask them, �Hey, are you open to additional streams of income? You know, you can probably phrase it a little bit better than that but actually follow up with these people saying, �Hey, you know we had a conversation about TLC or whatever and I just want to follow up and just to see if you are actually open to what we�re doing business wise",1
"You know, would you be open to a side project that wouldn�t interfere with what you are currently doing? Very easy line and you get a yes or maybe you can take it from there",1
I did some videos on how to deal with in terms of answers to that question but this information should help you here in today,1

CHRISTI HILL: You absolutely need to be a part of the conversation.,1
You have to get comfortable with the ambiguity of not being able to control what the conversation is.,1

"Not that you wouldnt get that in Austin but San Antonio is just a much larger market, its got a unique population, and the reputation that UT Health Science Centers School of Nursing had in Texas-- I heard very good things about it and Id also met nurses in the Austin area whod also am graduated from the program and had nice things to say about it",1
"So for me, between the idea of coming to a place that would have you know great opportunities for clinical practice, with also tuition that was subsidized by the state",1
As you know all Health Science Centers in Texas charge about a third less than your typical state university systems do,1
"So you know that was also an added bonus, I also knew that San Antonio was a military town",1

A 401k is a governmental retirement program designed to allow working employees to put away money for retirement and not pay any taxes on the growth of that money.,0

"You see, people who join the industry as a financial professional have a tremendous opportunity to build a business",1
"They can build a business that drives the financial outcomes that they need to live the life that they wanna live They have the freedom to choose when and where they want to work, and they have the autonomy to choose who is that they want to work with",1

We think an accountant looks a certain way and talks a certain way and dresses a certain way,1

So we think the same,0
"We can picture a developer, designer",0
We can picture a manager,1
"We kind of know what, what all these people look like in our heads",1
And that influences who we pick to do these roles,1
"In a previous career, my manager hired a guy for a sales role",1
And I remember laughing to myself,1
"I was like, this guy wont last a week",1
"He was so quiet and shy and you could barely hear him when he spoke, and that wasnt very often",1
"And sales is really macho, you know",1
"if you feel that anger is coming up, is coming up from down there in the bottom of our consciousness",1
"So when the storm is about to break out, we know",1
We feel signs of the storm,1
"So we have to prepare in order to be able to resist, to deal with the storm",1
"Yeah, the campaign for real beauty was really breakthrough.",1
It started in 2004 and I think the reason why it was so innovative was it’s actually built on three pillars.,1

"Two, we challenge beauty stereotypes.",1
"So, we helped women understand or encouraged them to believe that that beauty is more than just being young, skinny, and blonde.",1

NARRATOR: And achieving meaningful use provides incentives,1
PATRICK HAMILTON: Congress and CMS have acknowledged the fact that there is a resource commitment that is available and that providers should take advantage of the money that Congress has made available through the Recovery Act so that they can be incentivized in order to implement these electronic health records and actually use them in a meaningful way,1
"In terms of the incentive program, I always tell doctors who are a little bit hesitant or resistant to the idea of change and the implementation of electronic health records that in 10 to 20 years, were really not going to be having this discussion any further",1

Now its important to note that you dont have to be a teacher in classroom to do Action Research,1
You can sign up for this even if youre not in the classroom,1
What I suggest you do for all these is take a look at MED capstone pamphlet,1
Theres some detailed information in there,1

As a teacher I believe there is a need to make accommodations for all learners.,1
"Prior to these courses, though the @One Certification Program I thought my grasp on Accessibility was strong.",1
I was required to include a disability statement and phone number on my syllabus so students could make their own arrangements.,1
My thought was yes things should be made accessible but that wasn’t my responsibility.,1
There was an office and they knew what to do.,1
This was unrealistic and immature.,1
Through this course I learned it was also my responsibility to work with the campus disability office and the student.,1
Making sure their needs were being met.,1
I will do that too,0

So my name is William Knowlman and I study Maths and Spanish at Aston University and I was lucky enough to find a placement with Pricewaterhouse Coopers which is a tax and audit firm in Chile.,1
"now Chile is a country I dont know a huge amount about before going there but what I realised upon arriving is its actually got fantastic opportunities for graduates that can speak English and Spanish, or are bilingual.",1
And this is because theres plenty of multinational companies out there crying out for graduates that speak two languages.,1
I think the best thing that I got out of my placement was obviously the Spanish-speaking.,1
"I found... immersed in the culture, perhaps the culture doesnt speak as much English as youd find in Europe, really helped me grasp the language.",1
It was something that was rather nerve-wracking at first but really helped me and I find myself in quite a strong position finishing my degree and also a good position to return to a Spanish-speaking country.,1
I think working in Price has give me a good... gap bridger between doing a maths degree and going into business which is now - from the placement - something Ive realised I want to do.,1
"Its perfect - its given me the tools in tax, in Excel and things like that and a bit of knowledge, background knowledge that I can use in the business and I hope that this will be able to bring me into a job, incorporating all these skills that Ive learned on placement.",1

"Mary Barbara, autism mom, board certified behavior analyst, and best-selling author",1
"Last week, my video blog was all about not overusing a childs name, especially when placing a demand or saying no",1
But we want our clients and children to learn to respond to their names when called which is a huge skill that many children with autism struggle with,0
A child not responding to his name once called can be one of the first hallmark signs of autism,0
This is considered a red flag on the Modified Checklist for Autism and toddlers or the M-Chat and a diagnostic indicator on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule known as the ADOS,1
"So since many children with autism have difficulty responding to their name, I thought I would address it in this weeks video blog",1
I created and have used the following procedure to teach children to respond to their names with dozens of children with autism and have found it to be very successful,1
"The key here is to pair the childs name with improving conditions, which is called reinforcement",1
Since any behavior thats reinforced should maintain or increase,1
"The following is an excerpt from page 106 of my book, The Verbal Behavior Approach",1
"First, tell everyone in the environment to stop using or limit the use of the childs name throughout the day",0
"Most importantly, as I said last week in the last video blog, do not link the childs name to demands such as Dennis go get your shoes, Dennis come here",0
Limiting the use of the childs name will actually help him to learn to respond to his name when called because he wont tune you out as part of a long list of demands,0
"Next, gather several of Denniss reinforcers which should be his strongest consumable or controllable reinforcers, such as chips or bubbles and then go behind him when hes engaged in another activity, you have your chips and bubbles, call his name while standing behind him and then immediately touch a shoulder and hand him a chip or blow the bubbles",0
Gradually fade your prompts by standing a foot or two farther away and by delaying the touching of a shoulder by a second or two,1
"By using this procedure, Dennis will learn that when he hears his name good things happen",1
"For best results, I recommend using this procedure in both the home and school environments and I also recommend taking data every trial for 10 or 20 trials per day so that your distance and the reinforcement can be systematically faded out and your client will become more successful with responding to his name",1

In the natural resources and energy field theres a strong emphasis now on evaluating whether certain policies or programs are doing what they should do,1
The number of programs in the energy field that are being rolled out to encourage energy conservation and energy efficiency has been exploding recently,1
The Opower program is a behavioral program in which residential customers get what are called Home Energy Reports,0
These Home Energy Reports give the individual information about tips on energy use,1
"It tells them how they’re doing compared to their past energy use, and compares their energy use to that of their neighbors",1

Can I get fluconazole over the counter?,1
"You can get it over the counter and its become recently available now in many countries as an OTC or over-the-counter drug, but why would you want to take a drug like this over the counter without seeing a doctor.",1
Fluconazoles quite a powerful drug with many potential side effects.,0
"If you go to many databases online, you can read about all the nasty side effects from diflucan or fluconazole.",0
It has some very powerful effects on the liver.,0
So my advice to you if you must take this drug is to take it in a very short period of time and certainly dont repeatedly take this drug.,1

because the Bible says creationism is the truth,1
And I think thats so telling right there,1
And I realized there may be a lot of people out there who had no idea how not based in science Ken Hams views were,0
"And when you expose that nonsense to the masses, that probably benefited the scientific community",1
"Like, Oh, this is the hyped debate",1
This is the best the other side has to offer and it was horrible,0
And maybe that exposure of someone who has such a silly idea is what we need,1
"And I was thinking that maybe by exposing a lot of their teaching to the masses, itll actually help",1
And the few bucks I had to pay to get into the Creation Museum its a small price to pay for the opportunity to expose what theyre doing,1

Sequences are fundamental to computing.,1
A sequence is an ordered set of values.,1
Here we have the colors of the rainbow in order.,1
There isnt just one class for sequences or one data abstraction that describes sequences in Python or in programming languages in general.,1
The sequence abstraction is a collection of behaviors about how sequences can be manipulated.,1
"The two important behaviors that define something as a sequence are that a sequence has a finite length and a sequence has an element, thats another value, corresponding to any non-negative integer index less than its length starting at zero.",1

"Theres no argument over the choice  between peace and war,  but theres only one guaranteed way you can have peace and you can have it in the next second surrender.",0
"Admittedly, theres a risk in any course we  follow other than this, but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement, and  this is the specter our well-meaning liberal friends refuse to face that their policy of accommodation is appeasement,  and it gives no choice between peace and war, only between fight or surrender.",0
"If we continue to accommodate, continue to back and retreat, eventually we have to face the final demand the ultimatum.",1

"Ive been in about five or six schools in about five states, and pretty much every educator I have met wants to help kids.",1
They want to teach.,1
They want kids to learn.,1
"And the beauty of the community school strategy in a school is that it is the method by which — the strategy by which teachers can teach, and they can accomplish that goal because what they have in front of them, their students, can gain access to the teaching and the learning and all of that research that the entire nation is spending money on figuring out how to teach.",0

So what kind of symptoms were you experiencing before you came in to see Dr. Polzin?,1
"Hi everyone, this is Yasuko and its time for Massage Monday",1
I often get questions on my videos like Will this work for me? or How long will it take to see the results? Its a valid question and I would wonder that too if I watch a tutorial video for something that I want to see the results,1
Instead of repeating myself over and over again heres my answer - I dont know,1
"I dont know you but even if I knew you, I dont know how long its going to take to see the results or if something works for you at all because everyone is different",1
The only way to tell is by actually trying it,0
I dont even know if something works for me unless I try it,1
If you happen to see lot of happy comments maybe it will work for you too but you never know unless you try it,1
Everything you see and hear in this world is someones opinion anyway,1
"When I share something that I learned from others, Im sharing someone elses opinions",1
For things like Acupressure it could be someones opinion from thousands of years ago,1
Hopefully what I share or the opinions I share works for you in a way its presented but if not theres ton of information out there and I hope you find the solution that works best for you,1
"As you try the possible solution, remember to take the ownership of your body and listen to your body",1
Stop doing things if you feel theyre doing disservice to your body,1
Go to a doctor if certain symptom persists,1

Oftentimes there are programs around the country that are specifically geared towards minority business owners that need financing.,1

"If we if our default is there inside of that space, its like putting a limiter on our potential",1
"When were in that space, do you think we are attracting people to us or you think are we may be pushing some people away",0
Are we making people want to be around us a lot or we may be only attracting other angry people or other stressed out people that we can relate to,0
Theres another range of emotions,0
"Now that doesnt mean you cant bounce into stress, which is just fear",1
You cant bounce into anger or you know defending somebody or something,1

"But on the other hand, you think, isnt that for these guys, for the nerds?",1
"Well, Im here to tell you that programming and data analysis is really for everyone.",1
- So here is a sure-fire way to get more connection cards filled out by new visitors every single week,1
"Are you ready? Here it is, ask for less information",1
"And Im serious here because I see so many connection cards that are asking for perhaps half a dozen, even a dozen, different fields of information from new visitors and its a very simple premise here",1
"The more information you ask for, the less cards you are gonna have returned",1
"Its already difficult enough to fill out a physical card, walk to your connection desk, welcome desk, whatever you call it, hand that to a real person there",1
They exchange that for a free gift,1
There are so many moving pieces here,1
"Theres a lot of variables, so what we gotta do is remove as much as variables as possible so that we can have more cards filled out by our new visitors so for instance, we do this all the time in digital marketing and this is a comparison between physical interactions and onboarding of individuals versus the digital side, on the digital side of things, when someone comes, cold, has never met us before online, what do we do? We wanna get their information, much like churches, what were trying to do with new visitors",0
"All we ask for, though, is their email address, right? Because its a digital interaction and so its a little bit different",1
We ask for someones first name and their email,1
"Sometimes, all we ask for is their email and nothing else and what well find is, and we can track this because its done digitally and on a bigger scale, the more fields that we ask for, if we ask for first, last name, and email, three different fields, well notice a drop in responses",0
"Now, if you are gonna be doing this, you also have to recognize that the more fields that you ask for, when those do get filled out by people, those are gonna be higher quality responses, right? Because youre separating some of the people that dont wanna respond, youll get higher quality responses the more form fields that you ask for but when someones already visiting you at church, theyre a pretty high quality responder already and so, to get more cards filled out, just ask for less information",0
"What would I recommend that you ask for? I recommend that you ask for first name, last name, email address, thats it",1
"Maybe, if you need a fourth thing, you could throw phone number on there",1
"Theres basically three big things you could ask for, right? Phone number, email, and actual address, physical address",1
"Dont ask for all three, dont ask for their postal code, their ZIP code, their gender, how many people are in their family, if they want to get connected to a small group, if they wanna get baptized, if they want to dedicate their life to Christ, theres so many things you could ask",1
Get the information first and then follow up secondarily and get that information on the next interaction,1
Im not saying you shouldnt get that information just dont ask for it upfront,1

"Many of the worlds poor have access to education and, in fact, have been to third, sixth, ninth grade.",1

"One is to buy em from a reputable source; Amazon, or any of the major big box retailers that also have online activities; a trusted buyer, thats your first.",0
"A second is used, always a little bit more tricky, your major auction sites can do but theres a little bit more risk because you know when youre dealing with basically DVDs or game DVDs a scratch or two you may not see can ruin your whole experience on it.",0

My name is Monique Burns of Great Day Property Management,1
"We are a Detroit, Michigan property management company that buys the properties ourselves",0
"We place the tenants, and then we sell the properties to investors all over the country and all over the world",1
Right now they are enjoying their 12%-18% return on investment,0
"In this video, I am going to discuss the services that we offer",1
One of the first things that we do is we find the location of the house,1
"In Detroit, you can go on Google Earth",1
You can read statistics,1
It does not matter,1
"Unless you live here, you dont really know how one street will perform compared to another street",1
My husband is a Detroit native and he has a really good sense of really good places to buy properties,1
"In Detroit it is like block by block, or street",1
"You go one street over, it can be the end of your investment",1
Another service that we offer is the renovation,1
That is another part that my husband does and when he renovates the houses he does it such that we get as few calls as possible,1
"So when our investors are first buying the properties that first year, the repairs are very very minimal",1
Then we also offer tenant placement,1
That is where I come in,1
I have quite the extensive background checking that I do,1
It even includes visiting where they currently live,1
Which can be a real eye-opener,1
Then we also offer one of the best insurance rates of any other Detroit landlord that I have ever talked to,1
"That was through a lot of research and we are really happy with this insurance company so that is something we can help you with when you become an investor, is a really good insurance rate",1
We also are great about the taxes because we have our contacts in Detroit that help us make sure that we have the best amount of taxes due that they are fair and reasonable,1
Another thing that we are able to do is guide you through a 1031 exchange,1
We have experience with that,1
"We know the timing of it all, so we are happy to work with you through that",1
We can also help you start your own LLC if you dont want to own the house in your own name,1

[Music playing] So in graduate school I just come from rapid start up of environment and a lot of the entrepreneurship courses were focused around the more theoretical component,1
Taking tests and writing papers and while theory is important my co-founders and I are believe is the best way to learn entrepreneurship is like doing it the practice of it,1
The idea was three-day startup is that the best way to learn how to start a company is by starting the company,1
We get students together over a weekend for three very intense days of starting a company,1
I think I was really surprised about some of the skill sets but a lot of Davidson students could bring to the table on such a short notice,1
"And the fact that we were able to produce a functional prototype in three hours that would actually be downloaded onto a phone and actually do what it was supposed to on such a very short-term basis, I thought that was really amazing and showed me the potential of Davidson to create something on a short-term basis",1
what we could do if you actually devote large amounts of time to it,1
I wanted to learn more and I wanted to grow my understanding of what it meant to be in business and what it meant so start your own business,1
So I saw this theres an awesome opportunity when we went out and we talk to customers about if they would like our products and it was an intense instigator like process that I thought was an incredible opportunity and something that Im so fortunate Davison allowed for it to come to campus,1
Initiatives like this provides students a space to reimagine the possibilities of where the liberal arts can take them,1
"It provides space for exploration of possible career pursuits, of places where your passions can plug into what youve learned during college",1
Its a singular opportunity to just find where your leadership strength emerge and to really realize your identity in a new way and to get a full experience that Davidson offers,1
"The rate of change in the world is increasing, right",1
"This is happening through technology and a number of other factors, but innovation and entrepreneurship moves incredibly quickly",1
By having these programs here is equipping the students to have really great careers and really great lives,1
Everyone should take the opportunity to get involved some entrepreneurship programs if you never know what lessons you can learn from them,1

And there are probably 30 womans clothing stores in the three block radius of my store.,1
"So for me, its much easier to get that awareness.",1
The awareness is really key to increasing the sales.,1

And this is Corys question.,1
"What is the best way to pay off $32,000 of student loan debt?",1
Cory thats a very good question.,1

The infographic from the 2015 Recruiter Nation study found that what they look for can be broken down into nine categories their feelings towards each category was represented in percentages of either positive negative or neutral,0
The top negative feelings that recruiters had towards social profiles were spelling or grammatical errors in posts or tweets and reference to marijuana use,0

What happens if I am hit by a person who does not have insurance or who does not have enough insurance to cover my damages?,1
"First off, California requires that every driver carry a minimum liability policy.",1
The minimum policy is whats known as a 1530 policy.,1
"But the reality of the situation is since theres so many people in California, a lot of people dont have insurance, or a lot of people dont pay their insurance on time.",1
So you cannot rely on that person to cover for your damages.,1
"If you are hit by a person who has no insurance, you may have the option to sue them.",1
"You may get a judgment against them, but getting a judgment does not mean youre going to get paid.",1
You have to collect on this judgment.,0
The chances are people that have no insurance are not going to have the assets necessary to pay out this judgment.,0

Ill be heading up the lipidomics core,1
Were gonna be looking the lipids in red blood cells and bone marrow aspirates,1
"Lipidomics is where we take a substance of any kind, you can look at plant material, you could look at human material, you could look at just in our case, with this malaria project well look at the red blood cells and bone marrow aspirates and try to evaluate all the different kinds lipids that are there, and lipids are just fats",1
"So anything that is basically not water-soluble, you would have seen this in cooking at home and were going to look to see if we can evaluate all the different kinds in a qualitative sense where we dont try to give you a number of how much is there back out, but just what types lipids are present and were also going to do some more rigorous quantitating",1
Where we evaluate how much of individual molecule types are present in response to the malaria infection,1
Well its its really a great opportunity,1

Good job.,1
"model, and the Positive Activation – Negative Activation (PANA) model",1
Circumplex model The circumplex model of emotion was first developed by James Russell,1
"This model suggests that emotions are distributed in a two-dimensional circular space, containing arousal and valence dimensions",1
"Arousal represents the vertical axis and valence represents the horizontal axis, while the center of the circle represents a neutral valence and a medium level of arousal",1
"In this model, emotional states can be represented at any level of valence and arousal, or at a neutral level of one or both of these factors",1
"Circumplex models have been used most commonly to test stimuli of emotion words, emotional facial expressions, and affective states",1
"Russell and Lisa Feldman Barrett describe their modified circumplex model as representative of core affect, or the most elementary feelings that are not necessarily directed toward anything",1
"Hi, Im Tom Choisnet, enrolled agent and this comes up all the time, people like to complain, Why am I paying tax on my state income tax refund? Well thats an honest lament.",1

"Professions, then, are achieved statuses",1
"So is being a student, or a parent",0
"Beyond this difference, there’s also the fact that some statuses are more important than others",1
A master status is the status others are most likely to use to identify you,0
"This can be achieved, like “professor,” or ascribed, like “cancer patient",1
"” And as that example shows you, a master status doesn’t need to be positive or desirable",1
"In fact, it doesn’t even need to be important to the person who holds it",1
"It just needs to be important to other people, who use the status as their primary way of locating that person in the social hierarchy",1
"Also, statuses tend to clump together in certain ways",1
"Most CEOs are college educated, for example, but they aren’t always",0
And a mismatch or contradiction between statuses is called a status inconsistency,1
"When we talk about PhD students working as baristas, we’re really bringing it up in that way, because theres a status inconsistency between PhD and barista",1
My name is Janelle and I’m from the United States.,1
I speak English and Spanish.,1
"Like the rest of the Language in Motion Team, I’m a language lover and I am also passionate about traveling and learning about other cultures.",0
"During this video, I will explain and demonstrate a couple of ways that English speakers use body language and gestures to communicate.",1
You may find that there are similarities between non-verbal communication in English and in your native language.,1
"Or, you may find that there clear are cultural differences.",0
Gestures The use of gestures can sometimes substitute spoken words.,1
"For example, a wave says hello or goodbye.",1
Rubbing your hands together suggests that you are excited or anxious for what is coming next.,0
"To signal that someone is to stop making noise, hold an index finger against your lips.",1
Gestures can be used together with words to emphasize a point.,1
Using a gesture with a conflicting verbal message results in confusion.,1
Body language Posture effects how a person perceives the speaker even before the speaker starts talking.,1
"Sitting with proper posture, a straight back, arms at your sides, hands folded or relaxed and not on your face, are important in professional settings such as during a presentation or an interview.",1
Relaxed posture is acceptable with close friends but may not always be acceptable with family.,1
"Hi there, this is Jonathan Ginsberg.",1
Id like to offer you some tips about how to improve your chances of winning your Social Security disability case.,1
One thing you should definitely do is prepare for questions that you know you are going to get.,1
This is really something that your lawyer should work with you on prior to your hearing.,0
"I do it with my clients usually a week or two, even three weeks before the hearing; we actually practice the questions.",1
"Usually, I spend more time on the pre-hearing in that meeting than the actual hearing lasts but I want my client to be prepared and there are certain things that you are always going to be asked.",1
"For example, if its a physical case, where theres a physical problem, you are always going to be asked, How long can you sit at one time?",1
How much total sitting can you do?,1
What kind of breaks do you take?,1
"After youve sat for 15 minutes and you need to get up, how long do you have to move around for? And again, how much total sitting can you do during the day?",1
Youll be asked the same thing about standing; How much standing can you do?,0
How much walking can you do?,0
How much lifting?,1
"Dont say Not very much; you want to say five pounds, I can lift maybe five pounds, a gallon of milk, which is eight pounds, by the way, is too heavy.",1
They want to know how much you can lift frequently; how much you can lift occasionally.,1
"Problems with activities of daily living; getting dressed, bathing, preparing meals, taking care of personal needs.",1
Those questions are always going to come up.,1
"Natural eye contact in conversation, and in presentations for that matter, is about four seconds.",1
Its about a complete thought.,1
Measure it when youre having conversations with friends.,1
So employers are concerned that you dont really have a proven track record of responsibility and you dont have any references,1
So what your best bet is to pull from your life experiences that prove you are responsible and professional,1

Im a very motivated worker and fast learner,1

This is financial planner Patrick Munro checking in with you today about how does an annuity work?,1
"An annuity is, got several phases to it.",1
"The triangle, three points, so we have Africa as a source for slaves, the labor force",1
"we have the New World, where the commodities are produced, sugar",1
"First, on behalf of the people of Israel, I wish to send condolences to President Obama, the American people and the family of Kayla Mueller We stand with you.",0
"Israel’s survival is not a partisan issue, not in Israel nor in the United States.",0
This doesn’t mean that from time to time Israeli governments have not had serious disagreements  with American administrations over the best way to achieve the security of Israel.,0
"Israels first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, declared Israel’s independence in the face of strong opposition from US Secretary of State George Marshall.",1
"Likewise, Prime Minister Eshkol’s decisions at the start of the Six Day War, Prime Minister Begin’s decision regarding the nuclear reactor in Iraq, and Prime Minister Sharon’s decisions to press ahead with Operation Defensive Shield; These were all strongly opposed at the time by American administrations.",1
Disagreements over Israel’s security have occurred between prime ministers in Israel from the left and from the right and American presidents from both parties.,0
None of these disagreements led to a rupture in the relationship between Israel and the United States.,1
"In fact, over time, our relationship grew stronger.",0
But we do have today a profound disagreement with the United States administration and the rest of the P5+1 over the offer that has been made to Iran.,1
This offer would enable Iran to threaten Israels survival.,0
"This is a regime, Iran, that is openly committed to Israel’s destruction.",0
"It would be able, under this deal, to break out to a nuclear weapon in a short time, And within a few years, to have the industrial capability to produce many nuclear bombs for the goal of our destruction.",0
This is not a personal disagreement between President Obama and me.,0
This is financial adviser Patrick Munro talking about top annuity producers.,1
I happen to be a top annuity producer and I would like to share with you how I got to that level of production.,1
Its a situation where you have to work with a compliant insurance company or companies as a broker.,1
One of the common issues that Im asked to assist with is the fear that agency owners are only outsourcing so they can sack their local staff,1
"I have to be honest, I thought the same thing years ago when I was working for a property management company and they had employed an overseas VA and it was my job to upskill them",0
I thought theyd be upskilled and Id be sacked,0
"In reality, outsourced staff cant do inspections",0
They cant build face-to-face relationships with your clients and they can not be licensed,1
"These are all tasks, if done well, theyll make your agency stand out from the crowd and can support you in your local admin tasks",1
We have a bunch of case studies with clients where we explore their fears prior to outsourcing and the reality after working with us,1
"SECRETARY KERRY: Just last week, the U.S.",0

"Well, number one, its my brothers company",1
"Number two, I havent had any active role in over 20 years",1
"Um, number three, that the actual result is that my brothers company actually increased jobs in Indiana",1
"Um, there are more jobs in Indiana now than before",1
"And then finally, the reason theyre doing this is because theyve been missing in action on all of these efforts to try and keep jobs in the United States",1
I would ask them to work together with me on the End Outsourcing Act,1
I would ask them to work together with me to meet with the Carrier and Rexnord workers to try to keep jobs here,1
"As a utility brand, we’re still new in the social media space.",1
"One-- a lot of the work that we’re really focused on today is building up the content and the information that consumers need to make a smart, informed decision.",1
So we use some of that information ahead of the sale and then we use a lot of that information behind the sale.,1
"Hi, this is Rocco Beatrice, Managing Director for Estate Street Partners and the subject is divorce asset protection, how to protect the assets in divorce",1
Well quite frankly it may be too late,0
The problem is in divorce is that assets usually owned by both spouses are subject to a fair and equitable distribution,0
"But having said that, the use of an irrevocable trust even while divorce is being contemplated could be of help but if you are going to try to protect assets in divorce it really has to start with your parents",1
If youre going to inherit - lets say your parents are rich and youre going to inherit a ton of money youve got to talk to your parents about asset protection,1
You dont want that inheritance to become a marital asset,1
That in divorce is the subject matter,1
"What are marital assets? Marital assets are those assets that were acquired during the marriage, in some cases before the marriage",1
"The way to try to avoid that is third party, irrevocable trust, assets are not subject to equitable distribution in a divorce situation between divorcing parties",1
A third party is an irrevocable trust with an independent trustee - that is a third party asset not subject to equitable distribution between the parties,1
Now equitable distribution - its not 50-50,0
"When you go in front of a judge the judge is going to consider how long was the marriage, what assets were acquired during the marriage, and its going to be whatever the court seems to want to take in consideration",1
They deem it to be appropriate,1
One such example would be Who owns the dog? Whos going to get the dog? The Cat? You can see how,0
"And theyre in a marriage, what was the acquired living style that theyre going to need? If you have an irrevocable trust, a third party, its not a marital asset",1
"Even in states like California which is a community state and in a number of other states - Nevada, they are community states",1

&gt;&gt; Theres often been a dichotomy set up or proposed that really pits morals against researchers in saying that in proposing that human embryonic stem cell creation is tantamount to murder as it involves the destruction of the blastocyst.,0

"Raviv Druker: Why are you refusing to participate in an election debate  Netanyahu: Nu, I am debating you here Druker: I think you know the difference.",1

"In a new analysis, Ernst &amp; Young LLP finds that company-investor engagement has seen a significant component of some new governance trends.",1
"They are: the impact of say-on-pay goes beyond compensation; shareholder proposal topics shift and agreements for withdrawals are reached; board accountability measures continue to strengthen; and, director opposition votes show change in investors voting practices.",1
"Companies are using such engagement to respond to investor concerns, secure support for proposals put to shareholder vote and mitigate potential exposure to investor campaigns.",1
"It doesnt always occur, but it will",0
"The way to get along with people is to let them be what they are, unless they say I dont seem to get along with polocks",1
Very few people do that,1
In fact Ive never run into a person that said What do you think of my value system,1
What do you think of the way I think,0
"If they do that and its sincere, not an ego thing where they appear to be polite",0
If a person annoys you in some way just say I dont like to discuss races,0
"As you all know, I hope in a few days to celebrate my 75th birthday.",1

"At the end of this year we will remember that our country, two hundred years ago became a kingdom, with which in our history, a new era dawned.",1
The coincidence of these two special events has been the motivation for me to decide to abdicate this year.,1

"To quote the games creator, Scott Cawthon, its a simple pleasure in life when you can launch someone out of a chair, and its all captured on YouTube",1
"And because the game is mechanically simple, where all you do is flip between cameras and close some doors, theres very low player agency in the game",1
"The act of playing and the act-- [CLICKING] And the act of watching, are nearly the same thing",1

"So, weve looked at 2 search algorithms.",1
"One, breadth-first search, in which we always expand first the shallowest paths, the shortest paths.",1
"Second, cheapest-first search, in which we always expand first the path with the lowest total cost.",1
"And Im going to take this opportunity to introduce a third algorithm, depth-first search, which is in a way the opposite of breadth-first search.",1
"In depth-first search, we always expand first the longest path, the path with the most lengths in it.",1
"Now, what I want to ask you to do is for each of these nodes in each of the trees, tell us in what order theyre expanded, first, second, third, fourth, fifth and so on by putting a number into the box.",1
"And if there are ties, put that number in and resolve the ties in left to right order.",1
Then I want you to ask one more question or answer one more question which is are these searches optimal?,0
"That is, are they guaranteed to find the best solution?",1
"And for breadth-first search, optimal would mean finding the shortest path.",1
"- Im assembly member Marco Crespo from the Bronx, and Ih here to advocate for 18 million dollars in this years budget for the Healthy Foods, Healthy Communities Program.",1

Good day.,1
"Im Dr. Charles Grimes, and Im speaking today on behalf of Expert Village about finding a theatrical monologue for use in auditions.",1
Id like to tell you a little bit about knowing the reality of the audition process.,0
"Youll be working artistically to get your monologue together, and thats all wonderful, but youll be going into a business environment and a business situation.",1
"If youve been an actor long enough, people have told you its show business, its not show art.",1
Its a depressing but very true cliche.,1
but you cant be a passive participant,1
Thats why its important to remember Takeaway number two: get into the conversation,1
You know the importance of word of mouth in growing your business,1
Thats a concept they teach in traditional marketing and its no different here,1
"With social media, word of mouth has gone global and its critical that you start bringing yourself into the conversation",1
Conversations are already happening out there among your target customers and potential partners and if you want them to take notice of you you have to put yourself in the game and get into the conversation,1
Takeaway number three: the law of fabulous,1
"If you love what you are doing and you do it as who you really are without regard to what people might think, people you are meant to work with are going to be attracted to you",1
JASON KATCHER: Similarly to what is now allowing educators to take more risk is the fact that the internet has become a very transparent medium.,1
"Again, very different from other mediums that theyve traditionally used, such as television, or newsprint, or radio.",1
"The CEN Exam, also called the Certified Emergency Nurse Exam, is a specific test for already registered nurses who want to work in the emergency field.",1
Why am I fascinated with characters like Sherlock Holmes or James Digriz or various other characters who tend to be on the outside of normal society.,1
"And who seem to look at life with a different perspective, with the idea that theres something there to be seen and something there to be solved, something there to be deduced.",1
To learn something about somebody that may not be clear to everyone.,1
I think we all desire to know each others stories and I think that is something that were fascinated by and thats why Sherlock Holmes is a person that has been quite famous through out literary history.,1
I continue to find myself wanting to be that type of person.,1
Wanting to be observant of the world around me.,0
"its like, seeking out online discussions with people, how much is it serving us",0
And sometimes it might,1
"Sometimes you might want to learn something, sometimes you might be looking for someone to help you change your mind about something",1
"Sometimes, you might just be trying to gain more compassion for someone else, uh, even if theyre very different than you",0
Ive been a dance teacher for the past 10 years and It feels like my feet have been doing it for 30 years.,0
"I considered having bunion surgery, but I soon nixed that off the list, not only because the cost was outrageous but the down time after surgery...I didnt have time to be out of work for that long!",1
One of my friends whos a professional dancer as well asked me if Ive ever heard of Toe Stretchers.,1
"I hadnt so I looked them up on Amazon, I picked out the ones she recommended these worked the best . She has tried a couple...and these things are awesome...there are in it... like a gel form...They are really cool They fit my feet perfectly.",1
"So let me tell you, I was a little bit skeptical but she told me, she swore to the fact that these things work great.",1
And these are DenadaDance toe stretchers and it was the best decision I have ever made for my feet.,1
"After a long day of class, I put the toe stretchers on, my feet feel relaxed, it feels like I have not even been dancing once I have these on for a while.",1
"Goals Speaker: Dr. Erma Jean Sims, Sonoma State University There are four main goals to this session on illegal discrimination.",1
The first goal is to help teachers to understand what illegal discrimination is.,1
The second goal is to help teachers gain an awareness and understanding of the laws that pertain to illegal discrimination and how to prevent legal liability.,1
"The third goal is to help teachers recognize their own assumptions, bias, and taken for granted realities that may foster illegal discrimination in their classrooms.",1
"The fourth goal is to identify ways to prevent illegal discrimination and to provide a safe, supportive and positive environment for all children.",1
We will accomplish these goals by reviewing the law that pertains to illegal discrimination.,0
We will also discuss some scenarios on illegal discrimination.,1
This will give you an opportunity to make real world application of the law to these scenarios.,1
These scenarios are designed to heighten your conscienceousness to similar situations that you may encounter in your own classroom.,1
"JIM LECINSKI: Brand marketers, as well as their agency partners and media partners, are full of terrific amounts of talent who can create great content with speed, with relevancy moving forward into the recovery But there is another group of people raising their hands saying, we can help, too.",1

Youre doing absolutely nothing because you have this one that is statically charged,1
"Our student teachers teach usually our younger age groups between three and seven, at least for their first year",1
So they have ballet and tap and jazz classes,1
I have a few that have been with me since they were two and a half,1
And so you know now theyre in high school and yeah its amazing to see the transformation,1
I have one in particular that had two left feet when she started,1
"Shes now an amazing dancer and just, you know, teaching classes",1
Shes on her way to So You Think You Can Dance someday too,0
Miss Tiffany describes it as me having two left feet,1
I think I was just kind of I didnt really,1
I was just kind of a space cadet,1
all teaching at our school,1
And thats really what I care about,1
Newhouse stands for great teaching,1
Now I have been honored to be the first person in the history of the Newhouse School to win the teacher of the year award twice,1
And Im very humbled by that,1
But what is most important to me about that is that award is voted on by students,1
So I feel like I am a good teacher,1
And I feel like my students learn a lot,1
"Now you should know my reputation is I am tough, but fair",1
And I very much want you to be successful,1
But that means Im probably going to push you to do more than maybe you think you can,1
Now I do have confidence that you can actually do it,1
So its going to be a lot of hard work,1
And youre going to learn all about the media business because thats the way the course is structured,1
"Now its important, I think because I came from the sales side but worked with agencies, that you understand those different perspectives of this business",1
"Hey, Im Tracey Goodwin, and I am going to teach you how to write a great speech.",1

FERRIN: My name is Curtis Ferrin and my role here at Billings Clinic is Admission Discharge Transfer Nurse,1
"During the discharge process, when Im in front of patients and their families, theyre going to receive specific discharge instructions",1
"Hi Im Tim Spransy, the pastor of worship arts here at Crosspoint Church and Im just gonna take a couple minutes to tell you about scripture that has been speaking to me lately.",1
"I read uh... in Acts chapter sixteen about the uh... account of Paul and Silas and when they were imprisoned and its pretty remarkable story when you really read into the detail of it, but kind of an overview is they got  the local people really upset they ended up getting severely beaten and flogged and thrown in prison for the night and uh... I got to thinking about the condition of the prison and how miserable that must have been theres theres reason to believe it was either pitch black or at least a very very dark so if you can imagine being in a place like that where youve just been beaten.",1
Youre thrown into prison and your not sure whats gonna happen next.,1
"Well, what they do, around midnight the scripture says, they start praying and singing hymns.",0
Essentially worshiping God and I think that this is such a fantastic response to that circumstance because what happens then is theres this tremendous earthquake and the prison doors break open and shackles are loosing from their feet and theyre free to go.,1
They actually stay and lead the prison guard and his whole family to the Lord.,1
A lot of people get saved and they eventually do you get free.,1
I think what we look at when we read that scripture is we look at the miracle of the earthquake in the prison opening.,1
But to me uh... a miracle of equal billing is the fact that they were able to respond the way they did in such a horrific circumstance.,1
"They worshiped God uh... and thats a lesson that we can take from our lives and apply it into our lives when we get into, we all find ourselves in, very difficult situations and circumstances and what God wants us to do is to turn to Him and give Him thanks despite or because of our circumstances and worship Him.",1
"Also I went online and you know did some research the Deaf Blind Association, their website and things like that",1
So that was what I didnt know,1
Also I will include links below for you guys if you are interested in more information,1
Ok first I want to emphasize when I say Deaf Blind that does not mean necessarily a person is fully deaf and fully blind,1
"It varies just like people who are only deaf, you know their hearing loss varies",1
"Some people are Hard of Hearing, they can hear quite a bit",1
"Some people are fully deaf and they cant hear anything, and the same goes with Deaf Blind",1
Some people may be more deaf and less blind,1
Some of them might be fully blind and can hear a little bit more,0
"So, again it just kind of varies",0
"something that you dont practice, it just doesnt really work",0
Unfortunately this world makes us practice things that we dont want to be good at,1
We have a lot of practice at that,0
They asked us to spend a lot of our time dealing with it,0
They ask us to use blinders and were very practiced at it,1
"The more we scapegoat, the better we are at it and the better you are it, the more you practiced",1
"Dodging responsibility, the more you do it, the better youll get and so envy the people that cant do it cuz they havent had to practice this bullshit",1
Look and see what theyre asking you to practice,0
And how often do they ask you to put around your neck a noose everyday,1
Jesus is calling His children to COME OUT and be separate from everything that is wicked and ungodly.,0
"Sadly MOST people are associating with other people who are stuck in SIN, and because of this, that wickedness rubs off on them and they are NOT able to walk with Jesus but they are pulled off the road of righteousness.",0
"If you hang out with people who are wicked, who go on sinning they WILL corrupt you.",1
"Rather you NEED to COME OUT and be separate from EVERYONE who is living in sin, whether they call themselves Christians or whether they are not a believer at all.",1
"To summarize, in it we have some very powerful data automation capabilities and these also predefined built in methods which allow you to do operations on the whole struct.",1
And so we split up the parts of the report so everybody had their own part,1
And then at the end we kind of put all our parts together for the report,1
And so we did that,0
"You know, it was really shoddy work and so me and the other group members were really upset",0
We put a lot of effort into our part but Rick didnt do his part well,0
"But we interact with this world with our hand, and today it is not possible to interact with a natural action in virtual reality",1
"So we built a device, which is showing here we built a device, which is showing here on this finger, that is capable to recreate the sense of touch while interacting with the object",1
"what we can do: if you see a button you can click can click a button, but actually you can feel it",1
"When you can feel it, you can forget that you are in can you can forget that you are in virtual reality",1
At least for this basic human interaction strategies,1
Because if we can make someone click a button that means that we dont have to explain him what he has to do,1
Because its so natural to see something and click it with his hand,0
"Hello You Tube Im Ian Bremmer and Im taking about whether or not Obama is going to make a difference for the better in 2009. He certainly isnt going to make a difference for the worst, but the question is how much he can really do.",0

And secondly theres a question of just how much time and effort the Obama administration is going to be able to actually put outside of the United States.,0

"Today on REI TV, were gonna be talking about real estate marketing solutions.",0
How do you get homes?,1
"If you have a home, how do you sell it?",1
Do you do it yourself?,1
Do you list it for sale by owner?,0
Do you go through a realtor?,1
"And most importantly, are actually on the right side of defense to make the most money.",1
"Alright, when it comes to real estate marketing solution, you’ve gotta ask yourself first of all; Are you the home owner or are you the realtor?",1
"Because a realtor can charge a 3% commission, you got another 3% that goes out to the other agent involved.",1
There’s the buyer and sellers side or you can be the investor.,1
So which of those 3 are you?,1
"If you’re talking about listing a house, I always list with the realtor and I always do my paperwork with realtors.",0
Why do I do that?,1
"Well, for protection, for that legal paper work to make sure things are done and because I want maximum exposure.",1
If I’m an investor and I put a tenant in the house with a lease option; meaning like rent to own?Well that person’s actually gonnastep in and buy the house.,1
I don’t need a realtor.,1
You see investors are smart.,1

"On behalf of Expert Village, Im here to discuss your tips and tidbits on how to buy homeowners insurance.",1
"In this clip, were going to discuss underwriting philosophies and eligibility for coverage for insurance companies.",0
One thing thats very important is that you realize that there are guidelines to getting insurance.,1
Just because you buy a new home doesnt mean that it is eligible for coverage.,1
So some of the things we have to consider is: the age of the home.,1
"Are there any perils at home, any slip, trip and falls?",1
See if there are any prior losses.,1
"You can get this by talking to your insurance agent about doing a report, like a clue report, on said property, to make sure there are no prior losses.",1
Hey everybody what is up i Just wanted to do a quick review as well as my thoughts on the Kanye West and Paul Mccartney collaboration.,1
Actually this collaboration was rumoured about a month ago or two ago or even earlier than that in the press that these two collaborated and every one was curious was what the song was and now weve finally heard it.,1
The song is called Only One.,1
Its pretty subdued from what I was expecting to hear.Its got Paul McCartney on the piano and its got Kanye West in a very mellow kind of song.,0
hes singing about his mother whom he lost a couple of years ago.,1
It came as a big disappoint to a lot of people and its a pretty disappointing song to me . I think a lot of people had a lot of expectations about what the song would be but i think a lot of the time we have these amazing musicians get together and they try to make music and they have amazing music on their own but together they just dont have chemistry and they cant make good music.,0
it almost feels like kanye had a left over demo and said hey paul you want to play on this and paul sat at a piano and played the first thing that came to his mind and they probably released it and you know i think the biggest thing thats surprising about this song is that a lot of kanye fans dont know who Paul McCartney and theres a lot of tweets about people saying who is this Paul McCartney guy?,0
And the thing I want to say is that this generation has to be the dumbest generation that I have ever seen.,0
And I am a young guy and I am only 28. And in a day and age where we have access to so much information If i dont know what something is I google it.,1

"But epidemiologists are not diagnosticians, and they dont show that a particular condition in a particular person was caused by a particular event.",1
And thats what the law is about.,0

Hi Im Jim Teteak from Rule the Room &amp; youre about to learn how to deliver money-making presentations using tools and techniques that most business professionals will never know,1
"If youre looking to advance your career, boost your income level, persuade your clients or customers, or motivate and inspire your coworkers, then this is the course for you",1
"Even if you are comfortable speaking in front of an audience - in meetings, keynotes, and other public speaking venues, youre about to gain a competitive advantage by learning dozens of powerful techniques youve never seen before to sell your ideas, add value to your small talk, overcome your nerves, and make an incredible impression",1
"And if you are concerned that your fear of public speaking is holding you back from advancing in your career, well give you concrete steps you can take to stand in front of an audience and deliver your message comfortably",1
This is one of our most popular workshops for professionals,1
"Thats probably because we surveyed hundreds of business leaders, entrepreneurs, and independent consultants to determine the top 8 things they needed to give effective business presentations",1
This program addresses all eight,1
Let me just tell you how this course is organized so you can get a feel for whats in store,1
"In the first section, youll learn how to turn any topic, no matter how boring, into one that fascinates and holds the attention of your audience",1
"youll learn how to overcome your fear of public speaking, and feel less nervous when youre in front of an audience, so that your audience feels safe with you",1
"In section 2, youll learn how to make comfortable small talk, to help you land more clients, and build rapport with your coworkers",0
"This is one of the top things that business clients want to know - How do I talk to people 1 on 1? Next youll learn how to keep your audience listening, even after 45 minutes",1
Why 45 minutes? Studies show that peoples minds start to wander about every 10 minutes,0
Its called the drifting theory,1
But even more importantly after 45 minutes the drifting interval starts to quickly speed up and you really risk losing your audience,1
Youre going to learn the tools you can use to keep them on the edge of their seat no matter how long your presentation,1
"And finally in section 2, youll get the answer to one of the most common questions business leaders ask: How do I tailor my message for the specific people in the room? Youre going to learn how to do it, even on the fly",1
"In section 3, youll find out how to handle to challenging people in your audience",1
"The gripers, complainers, resenters, experts, talk-hogs, quite types, and know-it-alls",1
These people can quickly derail a presentation so you need to know how handle them and stay on track,1
Youll learn the top 10 most common presentation mistakes and how to fix them or avoid them to start with,1
"And finally, youll learn how to use the top 5 best practices in public speaking to deliver a convincing persuasive message to your audience",1
Thank you for taking this course,1
"Now, the first type of method of delivery is impromptu, and impromptu is where you and the topic meet for the first time and you have zero preparation time to speak about the particular topic.",1
"You have become more and more involved in watching the stock market and specifically, the rise and fall of the price of shares of individual stocks for individual corporations and you have been hearing terminology that youre not exactly familiar with and youd like to know more information.",0
One of the frequently ask questions is whats the difference between a nonprofit corporation and a for profit corporation.,1
"Certainly, you dont want to invest in a corporation thats not for profit.",0
Weve just adopted a new scoping plan for Californias climate program.,1

"So my story begins with kind of my upbringing, my background",1
I am from a one-hundred percent Italian family,1
"Being Italian means that your faith is to be Catholic, its your identity or Ive been told its my license in life",1
I saw a flyer up at Wheeling High School and they were looking for people to help with run some tech for a show,1
And so I built up the courage and I went and through that opportunity I met a friend Steve Luecht,1
"Many times Steve would invite me to church or to youth group and such but kind of going back to my time as being Catholic and such, Ive been taught and trained there was Oooh to go to anything that wasnt Catholic was bad and wrong",1
"You know God was working on my heart and softening it to finally, three years later, to finally decide Hey Ill go with you",1
"It really just stuck out for me starting there was, wow this is a community of people that love each other and care for for each other",1
"Fast forward a couple more weeks Steves parents, Wayne and Terry Luecht, offered Steve Luecht and Joel Alvarado to sleep over on a Saturday night",0
Now this was a Saturday night that we had homecoming so it was very convenient and very easy,0
"But, one of the things that his parents said to Joel and I said hey if you sleep over Saturday night we go to church early on Sunday so we really want you to come with us and so you know I started to build trust in them and so I was like all right Ill Ill go with you, and it was really interesting because this was the first time that I had been to a church experience where it was very engaging and very very real",1
"And why I say real is when the pastor came up to the to the pulpit he opened his Bible and then he said please join me in open your Bible, and if you dont have one theres one in the pew in front of you",0
Again it was just another way that God was building on my heart that the Christian walk is real and its alive,1
"One weekend in October we needed to dig a hole for the new sign thats in front of our church, so you know a couple of us guys and girls, you know we went and helped dig that hole for the sign in the front of the church",1
"But then that night after we digged it the whole it filled up with water because it started raining, and so Steve being a very handy guy and very involved in the church, he he said hey Jerry come with me were going to throw a sump pump in that hole and then were gonna get that water out of there",1
This was such an important moment for me because I had started coming to church going to youth group and hearing about Gods love and how there is a savior that you need,1
"Sitting at that hole and looking up at the front of the church, looking at the cross, and putting all this together and then looking back at that hole and realizing if I dont accept this Savior this this God Im going to go into this hole and Im going to go to hell",1
"And that moment that hole became very real, it became hell, it became hell for me per se and I knew that I needed to rise out of that hole and accept Gods free gift of salvation for my life",1
So that was around about October 22nd 1998 I accepted the Lord is as my savior,1
"And one of the things that I have continued to struggle with, which I mentioned at the beginning, was whats my identity",1
Who is Jerry? When you are with Christ when you are saved you cannot hold anything back you need to be fully one hundred percent on board to follow him for your life,1

Appeal mechanisms mitigate this problem to some extent.,0
An error which results in the conviction of an innocent person is known as a miscarriage of justice.,1
"After a defendant is convicted, the court determines the appropriate sentence as a punishment.",1

Does a yeast infection cause or increase the allergic response? Marjories email here states that shes been suffering from food allergies and believes she has Candida and wants to know if there is a link,1

"Not everybody with Candida has Leaky Gut, but certainly many people with food allergies will have a leaky gut",1
"And often leaky gut and Candida and food allergies all seem to belong to the same person, for want of a better word",0
So how do you get rid of the allergic response? You get rid of the allergic response by improving the small intestine function,0

And what I mean by that is usually a half a point or a point to buy the two years to three years.,1

"The noble gases do, too",1
"Normally, atoms react with each other to get a full outer shell of electrons, because that’s when they’re the most stable",0
"Noble gases are elements that already have that shell filled, so unless they lose an electron, they don’t need to interact with anything — and it’s very hard to force them to",1

"Hey guys, Bridget from Money After Graduation here and I wanted to answer a common question I hear all the time and thats, what are dividends and how do I get them? Dividend investing is one of my favorite ways to invest in the stock market and its one of my strongest passive income streams that I have coming into my wealth portfolio",1
I love being a dividend investor and I think dividend paying stocks and ETFs are an essential in every Millennials portfolio,1
"To understand what a dividend is, you really just have to understand what it means to be a shareholder of a company",1
"When you buy stock in a company, youre essentially becoming a part owner of that company",1
Youre giving them your money in exchange for a piece of their company,1
"Because youre now a part owner of the business, youre entitled to some of the rights and privileges of being an owner in the business and that includes the profit",1
So dividends are usually a cash distribution thats paid quarterly or sometimes monthly to shareholders in a company,1
"You dont have to do anything, all you need to do is purchase the stock before the ex-dividend date and then you will receive your payout proportional to the number of shares you own on the dividend payout date",1
This is what makes dividend investing so attractive and so easy its because it really is passive income,1
"All you need to do is own the stock, and you dont need to take any action after that",1
"The money is automatically deposited into your brokerage account, then you can use it to buy more shares in the same company, buy shares in another company, or to withdraw and spend it",0
"One of the things that makes dividend investing so attractive is companies often raise their dividends every year, typically by 10% to 15%",1
"This means the longer you own a stock, the more youre making on your original investment",1
"Most stocks will pay dividends in the range of about 1% to 3%, but you can definitely get stocks that pay seven, eight, or even double-digit dividend rates",1
Its important to remember when youre chasing these dividends that rate reflects risk,1
So high dividend payers are usually riskier stocks,1
"Nevertheless, owning a mix and a diversity of low dividend payers and high dividend payers because you have low and higher risk stocks in your portfolio is a great way to diversify your investments and increase your overall passive income",1
"Like with all investing, there are associated risks, the main one of dividend investing being that the company could reduce or even eliminate its dividend entirely",1
"Now this is extremely rare because it makes shareholders mad if you stop paying them, so a company will only cut or eliminate its dividend is its facing dire financial straits",1
"Otherwise shareholders are the most important people to a corporation so they will go to great lengths to continue to pay that dividend, pay it on time and increase it year over year",1
"If you guys are interested in dividend investing or investing in general you know I teach a course called The Six-Figure Stock Portfolio, Ill leave a link below if you want to check it out",1
Otherwise I hope you found this video informative and feel more comfortable understanding what dividends are and how they work in the stock market and why they can do so much for you,1
Deloitte has announced its plans to invest $750 million in strategic markets over the next three years.,1

"And so, were just going to jump in to some of the questions.",1
"First questions was, once you start podcasting, what are the ways to promote them?",1
-- to promote podcasts?,1

And this really just bubbled to the top.,1
Now lets talk about visual aides.,0
Did the speaker use visual aides and did he use them or she use them correctly?,0
"trying to understand and build my sales team at Flowtown, I didnt understand that theres actually different types of roles within a sales organization",0

"and not having the massive houses, and youll see that many times over and over if you would go and search out YouTube, or other videos that are dealing with information on housing is that we have built our communities really with three, four bedroom ramblers and as were having the aging population, no longer do we need a three or four bedroom rambler",0
"I love that research that shows that when you empower women in a country the situation in the country get better and that the countries that are the least free, and frankly the most dangerous are the countries that oppress the women, that keep their women down, that dont educate their women.",1
"Money really speaks too, and the fact that when you educate girls, when you help them go further in their careers that is actually very beneficial to the country, the bottom line of the country.",1
"And in terms of America, I think its actually , its really interesting, that the girls who come to our program tend to be the girls from low income, underprivileged communities, and I think that the reason why we get those girls is if you are living in a community that is just rife with problems and you dont see anyone working to solve those problems, you know some of these young girls, even at the age of 14 are saying: nobodys working to solve these problems and somebody needs to step up and maybe it should be me.",1
"So we get those girls who come in and they are hungry to change things in their community and they want to get that power to get people to listen to them, to really craft a message that will get people to help them and further their ideas.",1
"Hi everybody Dave Sullivan for the Credit Guy TV this week I want to do a quick little review on Credit Karma K A R M A they have a website they have set up giving away free credit scores and I went thought the process I checked it out fairly simple to sign up I like the fact that I did not have to put in my full social to get the information and it is all free, the problem is that it gave me a trans risk score with has no relevance to the FICO score but it just so happens to have the same range 300 to 850 and then it has a vantage and auto insurance score.",0
"and those scores are OK to look at and they are free but you should not get a false sense of security thinking that you know your FICO score it is going to very a little bit, but if you know what the ranges are for the other scores it may be a great way for you to check it out.",1
I am not big on that but I did like the portion in here the credit simulator I really liked how the credit simulator where you could add different things on your credit report and then find out what the score would be now again it will not be the same results as the FICO score but I liked the ability to play around with this it is a great way to learn it is really based on your credit score now the credit bureaus like the one I work at have had this tools for a long time for the loan officers they have had been able to do this go in and make corrections and see what the score would be really play with the model but the result was much closer to FICO than these are so you are just trying to learn and kind of test things out now there will be adds all over this site dont pay for anything but go in and I would defiantly do it and go in and play with the credit score simulator just so you can better lean about ways to improve your specific credit report it really is nice in that way.,1
I am going to go a head and recommend it provided that you dont buy anything I dont know how long this will last because as more and more people come in to it and they dont charge anything for it they are ether going to have to charge or do something to raise money I dont think the revenue created will support it.,1

"MICHAEL JONES: The advice that I would give retailers going into the holiday season would be, I would be cautiously optimistic.",1
I believe that most retailers actually are.,1
I do believe that there will be some spending online.,0
The bottom line is that most people as it relates to the holiday season tend to want to have a good holiday for their families and-- So I do believe there will be spending.,1
I dont think it will be as crazy as they have been in the past.,1

"Today I am going to talk about religion, and specifically, I am going to talk about a distinction that I think is often glossed over when people talk about religion, and that is the distinction between the official organizational stance of some type of organized religion, like Catholicism or like a specific Protestant denomination, like the United Methodist Church or any organization, so a distinction between the official organizational stance, and what people actually believe, which may or may not correspond to that.",0
"In some cases, like in the case of Catholicism, the official stance is that everyone is supposed to believe what the official organizational stance is.",0
"But I know a lot of people who identify as Catholics, and from talking to a lot of them, I know that many of them dont actually believe all the things that the church says they are supposed to believe.",0
"Ive had some interesting conversations too between people of different religious backgrounds, and Ive sometimes been surprised that peoples beliefs sometimes deviate from their official stances in unexpected ways.",0
"One example, Ive heard the comparison between Catholics and Protestants, Ive heard the statement that Catholics believe in transubstantiation, which means that when they take communion, the bread and wine actually becomes the body and blood of Christ, whereas Protestants dont believe in transubstantiation, they believe that its more of a symbolic meaning when they take communion.",1
If you want to learn more about cosmetic and natural preservatives,1
This is video for you Hi my name is Zane and Im from Atlantis Skincare,1
In this video I want to talk about water containing cosmetic products,1
"Basically, all the products containing water should require preservatives",1
"Why? Because water is very good environment for bacteria, molds and fungi to grow",1
"And without preservation it happens very very fast if you dont like preservatives at all, I would recommend you to learn how to make your own cosmetic products",1
But you should make them in a very small batches and keep in a fridge for maximum seven days,1
"Or you can watch another video about products without water and you will understand how you can use these skills to make your own products but if youre using products containing water, and youre buying them in the shops they definitely contain preservatives",1
In a market at the moment it is some more natural solutions for preservatives and most of them are even equal and organically certified,1
Only thing you should learn to read labels again,1
"In next videos I will share with you some more natural preservative options, and you can learn how to find them in a regent list and understand are they really in a product",1
"So, Im looking forward to meeting you and please watch another video about products without water",1
Can you imagine the implications of a woman having an abortion right up until the due date,0
"I have suffered a miscarriage, Ive had an abortion, and Im actually a mother of a six-year-old daughter who last night the teacher said to me, Your daughter is extraordinary",1
I have never had a student in my class as intelligent as your daughter,0
"From a miscarriage, from an abortion, and from having a child I can tell you there is only one that has liberated me as a woman, and that is being a mother",0
No one told me,1
the polling both nationally and in the states,1
"And so, you know, in that sense, dont upset the apple cart, dont do something that would - you know, would refocus attention on your own problems, and keep it on Donald Trump",0
I think for her theres a couple of questions,0
"One is, the first debate she clearly had a strategy to get under his skin and was very successful at it",0
It was less clear what her strategy was in the second debate,0
"Our facial expressions, to some extent reveal what we are thinking and feeling, it reveals our heart condition.",1
But people can easily misjudge also facial expressions; they may misjudge all of it.,0
"But let me tell you, if someone is frowning at what God approves of, they heart is NOT right with Jesus.",1
"But vise-versa, if they are smiling at what God hates and detests their heart ALSO is against God and they are anti-Christ.",1
Our hearts must align with the Holy Spirit.,0
People have accused me of not having the joy of Jesus because they THINK that Christians should always be smiling.,0
This is a lie.,0
"IF you are carrying your cross, then you are NOT smiling but you are diligently carrying your cross.",0
"People have also accused me of laughing or smiling saying that I am prideful and I make fun of others who are in sin, this is also a lie.",0

"We will be looking to work very closely with the state attorneys general, we regard ourselves as part of the same team.",1
I think what advertisers need to do to be successful in 2010 and afterwards is really think about a cross platform strategy and how these things happen synchronously or simultaneously with one another.,1
"Id like to introduce you to the Sun Oven, this is part of our series on sun oven cooking essentials, and Im just going to cover all the basics of everything you want to know about a Sun Oven, maybe a whole lot of things you dont want to know",1

"Hopefully all of you have already received a welcome letter to your e-mail, which gave you some basic descriptions about the course, but just like any other class, I will also provide with a detailed syllabus that will let you know about assignments activities, and due dates.",1
Information about how to access the course syllabus is located directly below in the getting started section.,1
By now Im pretty sure that you have also noticed that online courses are a little bit different from face to face courses.,1
"For one you do not go to a physical class to learn, or to listen to your professor lecture, instead you will attend a virtual class--at your own pace--where each of you will be working on weekly modules.",1
Each module addresses a different chapter in the book depending on the week.,1
"For instance, another of Kubzanskys studies found that optimism is associated with lower levels of inflammation",1
"If what you mean by happiness is specifically enjoyment of life, theres newer evidence to support that, too",1
A study in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that people ages 60 and older who said they enjoyed life less were more likely to develop disability over an eight-year period,1
Mobility was also related to enjoyment of life,0
"This study does not prove that physical problems are caused by less enjoyment of life, but suggests a relationship",1
Where happiness comes from: genes plus environment,1

"Umm... they are, they definitely are a head of the game when it comes to basement development and basement renovations and the reason for it is because they specialize in basements.",1

Is that what you learned in two days Paul,1
To my mind it appears that the difficulty is only imaginary and not real,1
"Rigidity and plasticity are not absolute terms, but relative, and all solids are in fact both rigid and plastic",1
When great masses and great forces are involved,1
"Sometimes the rigid definitions we create for ourselves can introduce misconceptions, or viscous rumors, like the idea that the core of the Earth is a giant ball of magma",1
If only we could think about liquids and solids a little bit more,1
"While were on the subject of franchises that may have already peaked, weve also got the official word that a new Gran Turismo game is coming out",1

The research project that Im working on right now is kind of comparing the old method that I used to the new method and doing a little bit of action research here within my own area.,1
But I really feel like my past portfolio was very traditional.,1
And that the students did the different assignments.,1
They developed instruments that they use.,1
And much of that was nutrition education since thats what our focus is for our internship program.,1

I just want to talk to you real briefly about the Puerto Rican bond situation.,1
"It seems that hedge fund professionals, professional investors are no investing in puerto rican debt that the prices are so depressed that these investors now feel like there is a significant upside to investing in Puerto Rican debt and they are willing to make the bet that Puerto Rico will make a significant comeback.",0
"Thats good news for Puerto Rico, however, many retail investors who had previously invested in Puerto Rican debt ended up having their portfolios wiped out because these financial advisors would put these conservative portfolios into a leveraged position and in some cases multiple leveraged or margined positions, which means they were borrowing a lot of money to invest in Puerto Rican debt.",0
"And when the bond prices went down, these loans were effectively called in, and these portfolios of these retail investors were wiped out.",0
"John: The economic crisis is becoming such a crisis of actions now not taken, for employment and the creation of equality in employment the center of the agenda on economic policy internationally.",0

"As GUE/NGL we consider that the selections of Mr. Junckers candidates for Commission positions have proved deficient and mistaken The failure of Ms. Bratusek to be approved by the Industry,   Research and Energy Committee and the Environment Committee as Vice-president reflected her inadequate performance in the hearings;  she has not clarified her position on the issues relating to the Energy Union We furthermore consider that the approval with a narrow majority of Mr. Cañete as Commissioner  for Energy and Climate shows that there was a major dissatisfaction among the Committees.",1

"Hi, Im Kate Kotzea and Im here to talk about marketing technology, or MarTech and why its important",1
"First, you might be asking what is MarTech? Well, its when marketing and technology come together to help us automate processes, to help us aggregate data to look at the business, and to really start to understand that customer experience from the first touchpoint to the last",1
We want to talk through four reasons why MarTech is important,1
"The first, is that MarTech really puts a priority on systems integrations or MarTech stacks",1
Whats a MarTech stack? Its when you can visually represent and categorize all of the different marketing technology platforms your company uses,1
"You really start seeing where things are integrated, and where there are holes",1
The second reason is that MarTech really looks at the whole customer journey,1
"So from that first touchpoint to the last, how are customers experiencing your brand? By having integrated platforms, were able to create smarter, and more strategic and personalized campaigns",1
"So its that right message, at the right time",1
"From strategic media placements and dynamic content, to the sales process and marketing automation, were able to unify that marketing message",1
The third reason is that marketing connect the dots between marketing and operations,1
"Finally those that are selling the business promises and those that are executing on the business promises are looking at the same data, the same business goals, and are really able to create more unified business decisions to help them reach those",1
"The fourth reason, is that MarTech lets you market smarter",1
"By having all of these platforms integrated, were able to see where we can automate processes to help streamline and create efficiencies",1
"Since everything is integrated, we can adopt processes faster, adopt trends faster, and scale those marketing efforts to get to market faster",1
"Ultimately, instead of aggregating all this data were able to spend time strategically looking at the data and making business decisions that can really impact the bottom line",1

Youd like to start a blog for your Legal Nurse Consulting wesbsite or you already have a blog and you want to be trying different types of posts and different approaches.,1
Consider telling a story.,1
We have been conditioned since we were children to settle down to hear a story.,0

"However, a fellow YouTuber named FuryForged was discussing things with me and mentioned another video editing software that isnt so intensive on a computer, so I gave it a try and it works!",1
I saw it standing there (the bicycle) and i thought by myself what is happening here?,1

"First thing you want to consider is, depending on the seriousness, the competitiveness, of the team youre coaching, whether they are just beginning athletes, or theyre twelve, fourteen, and under, pretty competitive traveling team.",1
"So, when I started in marketing, I did this.",1
Because I was a creative guy.,1
"And here I am today, I think Im really more of a marketing scientist.",1
And I think my team probably comprises more of scientific numbers people than it does pure creative people.,1

These women were willing to face him directly with an independent investigator.,1
"Rather than do so, he resigned more than a year before the end date of his contract.",0
Reporting sexual misconduct demonstrated real courage.,1
There is great risk to the victim in making the report.,0
"There is no guarantee what the reaction will be, whether there will be retaliation or how the person will be perceived by others.",0
The harm from abuse by a person in power and from the stigma that often comes with reporting is real even though the person reporting has done nothing wrong.,1

Welcome to OptionRally news and our weekly market event update,1
The big market event this week will be the Non-Manufacturing purchasing managers index,1
This week its all about the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI,0
"This data is released on a monthly basis and measures the Level of a diffusion index based on surveyed purchasing managers, excluding the manufacturing industry in the United States",1
"If the report is Above 50 it indicates industry expansion, and below indicates contraction",1
"This index is based on surveys of more than 400 non-manufacturing purchasing managers, within 60 sectors across the United States, by the Institute of Supply Management",1
The last index that was released in January registered 53 percent,1
9 percent lower than Decembers reading of 53,1
This indicates continued growth at a slightly slower rate in the non-manufacturing sector,1
"So why does this matter to you? First, It is a leading indicator of economic health, Secondly, businesses react quickly to market conditions, and their purchasing managers hold perhaps the most current and relevant insight into the companys view of the economy",1
"When this index is increasing, investors can assume that the stock markets should increase because of higher corporate profits",1
"The opposite can be thought of the bond markets, which may decrease as this Index increases because of sensitivity to potential inflation",1
"So How does this affect your trading? For traders, this data may be useful for examining the status of the industries in which they hold their investments, and examining the trends taking place in that corner of the market",1
"This indicator is gaining more and more attention with every release, providing insight into business areas that are not well covered in other indicators",1

"Well I think with the new channels of distribution, the digital channels, it’s that there’s inherently communication mechanisms that live there.",1
"So there are two way communication mechanisms, so that if the advertiser reaches the consumer, they can actually have a conversation, versus if something is happening on a linear or a theatrical experience, say television or radio, there’s not that two way mechanism for them to interact and that has to then take place on the consumer’s initiative at a later point in time.",1

We do have surgeons here who do that.,1
"But as the tear, particularly of ovarian cancer patients, it gets a little more complicated.",1
"More medical oncologists who specialize just in the chemotherapy side, just on the therapy side are becoming involved.",1
"And so I work very closely with the surgeons, but then my expertise is taking care of the chemotherapy, the side of patients after theyve received their surgery.",1
"So I am a bit of a mixed specialist in that I have internal medicine training, Im a medical oncologist, but I work very closely with the gynecologic oncologist and treat gynecologic oncology cancer patients.",1

Its not necessarily rude,1
It could be used in an affectionate or a joking way,1
Credit card sales are recorded the same as cash sales except the retailer incurs a  processing fee for being able to accept credit cards These fees can range from 2% to 6% depending on the type of card and the amount of business the retailer does.,1
Lets look at an example.,0
This couple is purchasing $100 of groceries using a Visa credit card.,1
Lets assume the retailer pays a 3% fee in order to be able to accept Visa cards.,1
"Finally, for simplicity sake, lets assume this transaction takes place in a state  that doesnt charge sales tax for purchases of groceries-like Minnesota.",1
The journal entry to record the sale by the retailer is a debit to cash for $97.00. This is the amount the retailer will collect from Visa.,1
Credit card discount expense is also debited for $3.00. This is the processing fee Visa charges.,1

The packaging is actually really cute.,0
"But whats inside is really what matters, right?! You dont want to pay $10 for a box, at least I dont!",1
"They send you a card that shows you whats in the box and, what the value is of each item in the box.",1
I didnt know that they were not going to be full sized products.,1
Theyre sample sizes.,0
"So, youre paying $10 to get basically four samples, and then a little extra freebie that they put in.",1
So the first thing in my box was the Bain de Terre Macadamia nut oil.,1

I dont see another domino falling.,0
I dont see another country that will want to follow Britains lead because I think what Britain is doing to itself will be pretty damaging.,1
"And in terms of political implications for the United States, or for India, or for China, I think those are pretty minor.",1
"From an economic perspective, I think also, the big problem is for Britain.",0
"I think there will be a lack of investment spending in Britain over the next few years, as people just try to figure out what Britains role in the world is going to be and how its going to relate to Europe in the future.",0

The Day of Silence has been one of the most successful grassroots protests for gay equality in the past decade.,1
So its no surprise that its also succeeded in drawing the ire of conservative Christians.,1
"Yes, apparently something so simple as students being silent to stand in solidarity with their gay classmates requires a response from the religious right.",0
"Theyve tried pulling their kids out of school on the Day of Silence, or at least claimed they were going to.",1

But one of the things that we have to make sure exist is conflict and resolution.,1

"When parents or relatives arent able to care for children, adoption can help give kids the permanent families that they deserve.",1
"And when adoptive families are not available in the places where these children live, inter-country adoptions can help find them a loving home abroad.",1
I firmly believe that ethical and transparent inter-country adoption is a critical part of the international childrens welfare system.,1
It helps ensure that kids receive the love and support they need to grow into healthy and productive adults.,0
I have seen it firsthand.,1
And thats why I worked hard in the United States Senate to help families navigate past roadblocks in the international adoption process.,1

"When we are able to make emotional wellbeing, part of a child’s health assessment when they enter care",1

Early stage investors want to invest in people around them because they want to help.,1
They want to be there on a regular basis and go through this super difficult thing of building a startup.,1

"If there are no such investors around you that are aligned with your business or you feel you can reach out to, I think putting yourself in a position where you can find ways.",1

"&gt;&gt; I decided to go into medicine because it filled kind of the two interests that I have, Ive been always interested in physiology of the human body especially of the brain and from the beginning, I was also interested in developing devices that might interface with the brain when people have diseases, for instance, blindness or paralysis or epilepsy.",1
And really the path I went on was a mixture of both of those things so I want to be able to interact with patients and see and help diagnose them but I also want to develop new treatments for them when standard medicine is unable to help them.,1
"So I think that communication is really a key point, especially neurology.",1
"When someone goes to see a neurologist, they usually have a pretty good idea what theyre in for, they often are very scared what the neurologist is going to say.",1
"And in my own specialty of epilepsy, they usually have a pretty good idea that were going to be talking about seizures.",1
"So I dont pull any punches, the way that I approach it is I am essentially consulting with the patients and the patient needs to become an expert in whatever disease they might have, whatever problem it might be.",1
"To do that, they need to have all of the information necessary and so they need to know exactly what I am thinking.",1
My plan when a patient comes in is first to collect the information and figure out whats going on.,1
"This is financial adviser, Patrick Munro, talking about reverse mortgage rules.",1
hey guys welcome back to my channel FearlessRN,1
"You ever doing an NCLEX question or nursing question and you had a drug that pop up in the question that you had no idea what it meant, what is for and you dont know how to go about the question? Well guess what?? Im going to help you figure it out! Im going to help you to be able to answer any pharmacology question without knowing what it is! subscribe! thanks if you did",1
"Like this video, so that i know that you enjoy this video and please share this video on any social media that you have",1
"Alright so lets get to this video! Alright, the first tip that i have for you is to think about safety! we all know that the goal in nursing and on NCLEX is to show that you are competent in providing patient safety",1
"So if theres ever a question thats asking you to do something, to the patient move the patient or anything like that, always think about safety first! You always want to assess the patient first",1
Uou always want to see if theres any changes in the patients condition which can tell you whether theyre improving or getting worse,1
The next thing you should know is to look in detail at the side effects of the drugs,1
"If you understand the side effects of the drugs then youll know whether its expected or unexpected and definitely if its an unexpected outcome or unexpected side effect, then you know that theres something wrong and you have to treat that patient first, right? Alright so my suggestion to you, is to learn the top side effects of each drug classification so that youll never be lost",1
"if you can understand the top side effects or the overall side effects of a particular classification of drug then youll be able to you know, answer that question with ease because youll be able to eliminate those that definitely dont belong in that classification",1
I also think its very important that when youre studying the diseases that you understand the top drugs that treat that disease,1
"With that in mind, youll be able to identify the drug immediately",1
Its also important to recognize the generic names of these drugs because on NCLEX unfortunately thats all theyre giving us,1
"I wont really say unfortunately because I feel like even though it was kind of tough to study, it was really important to know because in the medical field the doctors are gonna give you generic so its best to be familiar with the generic and brand-name for these meds",1
"On NCLEX, youll definitely see generic names being given, so familiarize yourself with that and youll be fine",1
"Another thing I would suggest is, elimination",1
"Theres a random drug in the option choice, and you absolutely dont know what it means, your best bet is to eliminate it and then critically think through the question to see if it make sense to stick with the answer choice left",1

"When I started learning tarot cards, I memorized all the meanings for the cards, and I looked in the book every time I did a reading, and thats the way most people learn",1
"But what I noticed was that when I focused on the traditional, generic meanings, all my readings were",1
generic! I wanted accurate insights,1

A surprise twist in AFERs Virginia lawsuit,1
"The Indiana House passes a marriage ban, but in so doing could actually delay its progress",0
"Utah and Oklahoma cases are speeding towards the Supreme Court, and our chances for victory have greatly improved in Nevada",1
"Plus theres progress this week in West Virginia, Hawaii, and Kansas",1
"For the American Foundation for Equal Rights, Im Matt Baume, and welcome to Marriage News Watch for February 3, 2014",0
Last week a judge in Virginia ruled that oral arguments would proceed in AFERs federal marriage case,1
But then we got an unexpected setback: snow,1
"Bad weather postponed the hearing, scheduled for last Thursday, to Tuesday of this week",0
Stay tuned for further announcements about our day in court,0
The Indiana House passed a constitutional marriage ban last week,1
But that might actually be good news,1
House lawmakers stripped the bill of a sentence that would have banned civil unions as well,1
"Because the language was changed, the bill will likely have to start the approval process all over again, which would push it back to 2016, at the earliest",1
"Indiana polling has fluctuated wildly, so its impossible to detect a trend that would predict how voters will behave in two years",1
"But its possible that the Senate could restore the language and refer the bill to a conference committee, in which case it could pass and head to voters this year",1
Or the Senate could kill it altogether,1
"Well be keeping a close eye on the volatile situation there, with further developments expected this week",1
We have a date for hearings in the Utah and Oklahoma cases,0
"Both cases recently won major victories for equality, and now head separately to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals",0
"The court will hear the Utah case on April 10, and the Oklahoma case on April 17",1
"Though the cases havent been consolidated, the court may rule simultaneously on both",1
"If they rule promptly, both cases could go to the US Supreme Court in its next session",1
Last week we reported that a Nevada case will be significantly impacted by a ruling in the Ninth Circuit that extended heightened scrutiny to LGBTs,1
Now Nevada Attorney General Katherine Cortez has announced that she will review the arguments made in a marriage case there,1
"A district could had previously ruled against the freedom to marry, but this new standard of scrutiny could render all of our opponents arguments invalid on the pending appeal",1
A case in West Virginia will progress after a judge denied a motion to dismiss,1
"Marriage is safe in Hawaii, where a judge last week rejected a lawsuit against last years equality act",1
And Equality Kansas has requested the introduction of two bills to repeal that states marriage ban,1
"Its still too early to evaluate the bills chances of success, but well be keeping a close eye on the situation in Kansas",1

"Currently, many EI providers are being forced out of business by a rate structure that seriously underestimates the cost of providing these valuable services.",0
"I fear that reducing Early Intervention program reimbursement rates will force even more veteran professionals to seize rendering their expertise to EI children, it will make employment in this field even less attractive to new professionals, and will eventually cause these essential services to reach fewer eligible children.",0

"Hello everyone, Braden Kelley here, author of the popular book Stoking Innovation Bonfire, an accessible look at 10 of the most common barriers to innovation that organizations face all around the world as they seek to make innovation a deeply embedded capability of the organization.",1
In addition the book also serves as a great innovation primer and is being used by universities like Creighton and acquired in quantity by companies including Microsoft and AB InBev to help establish a common language for innovation in their organizations.,1
One of the most popular parts of the book has been the Nine Innovation Roles which takes a team-based approach to innovation and innovation success.,1
Instead of looking at whether someone has innovators DNA or the right innovation personality the Nine Innovation Roles takes a roles-based approach to innovation team success.,1
And in a group workshop environment you can really investigate and delve into how to best structure your teams for achieving that success that you want to have in innovation.,1
In order to support that effort within your organization Im happy to make a few things available for free download today.,1
"That includes the design for the cool cards that I use in my workshops with Fortune 500 companies around the world and also a presentation that you can download to kick things off or a video if you want just a little bit more to help kick off you team meeting or workshop using the Nine Innovation cards that you can download and either print with the printer that I use @magic at your cost or with a printer in your local area, wherever you might be in the world.",1
"Now that doesnt mean that you still cant hire me to come and do a workshop for you and maybe kick it off with a great keynote but Im happy to make these things available for free for the organizations that may not have a budget for something like this, whether they might be in a governmental organization or just going through a tough time right now.",1
"But if you do want to hire me for a workshop you can find all the details on NineRoles.com and you can find all of these free downloads also on NineRoles.com including the card deck, the presentation, and the video so I hope youll check it out.",1
"And this has been Braden Kelley, author of Stoking Innovation Bonfire.",1
I just have one last thing to say and thats keep innovating.,1
"Hey guys, this is Richard with Short Term Rental Secrets",1
com and today I was taking a look at some Air B&amp;Bs that Im thinking about staying in and thought itd be really helpful to share with you some of the things that I think people are doing really well and some of the areas for improvement as it relates to your airbnb listing,1
So this is sort of how to optimize the success of your airbnb listing using the description strategically,1
The first thing I would say is Airbnb does a really good job of laying out different sections that youre supposed to fill in,1
"So they tell you in a standardized template, you know, fill this and fill this in, fill this in and I think people basically do that",1
"They check the box and so theres a bare minimum of information but dont forget this is marketing, right? This isnt just like information gathering",1
"People that are looking to stay at your home or your bedroom, theyre looking for an experienced theyre not looking for a minimum criteria",1
Theyre looking for a maximum experience,1
"So one of the mistakes I see people make all the time is they just literally detail all of the criteria, the features, has TV, has Wi-Fi has this, has that, has the other, and it leaves for the guests to interpret, Well gee this is how I might use it or this is what it might mean",1
And the best listings I see really create a vivid vision of what your time might be like,1
So like in this particular one that Im looking at it says enjoy having breakfast or dinner on the cozy terrace,1
Gee like I would love to do that! That sounds really really nice,1
"They could have just said breakfast China, lunch utensils, terrace, but instead they painted the picture: Enjoy having breakfast on the cozy terrace which do you think the average reader is going to be drawn towards or pay a premium for or book first? So the first tip that I would say is you really want to think about all of the things that your Airbnb listing has to offer",1
"Why you put them in there, how theyre used, and create this fantasy, draw them into you know your home and why you did it this way and how you use it, how others have used it, why they use it that way, why the location is primed for different things",1
"Dont just say its in this location, its in this location, which means you can walk for breakfast here and you can go there for lunch and then complete the day by having a drink over here whatever it is and now somebody thinks gee youre really speaking to me the individual youre talking my language and I think youre going to find much more rewarding bookings more income and also better SEO",1
"And like anything else its iterative right so your first listing shouldnt be your last listing you should visit it, you should check it out, you should improve it, you should a/b test it, try different language",1
Some of the adjectives that you might find are really helpful you wont know on day one,1
"So really take the time and energy, invest at the time and energy in your description because at the end of the day its going to drive revenue and thats after all why youre doing this",1
So I hope you found this helpful and go ahead and subscribe to our YouTube channel,1
Were filming content like this all the time and we really hope to see you soon,1

"Actually, you can even use it applying conditioner, styling products and hair treatments.",1
Nizoralshop says that you could also use for hair loss treatment products with it.,1
The fact that you dont need to use your fingers is great because any product you apply goes into your hair for a better scalp absorption.,1
"With its large ergonomic handle, senior citizens and people with special needs can grab the shampoo scalp massage brush very easily.",1
It also features a large and soft silicone pad and bristles.,1
"So, you can shampoo and get nice and gentle scalp massages at the same time.",1

My name is Jeremy Vreeken,1
"I am a Dordt student, a junior here, studying English",1
Ill agree that theologically the matter of like who build the earth is sort of important,1
"Um, but I think that for a lot of people my age it got frustrating when we had no practical living out advice",1
"Okay, so now that God created the world, what do you do about it and how do you live best on it, and with it? And I think, um, yeah, I was striving for more of a well-rounded perspective on those issues and I wasnt getting it from the church",1
"And that, um, made me really sad",1
"You know, you grow up in it",1
"People who love you and you love it, and its, you want to reconcile those two things",1
Coming here actually I met a lot of fellow students and good professors who were really passionate about how to live practically in the world,1
"Whether that is solving food desert issues or whether that is going abroad and purifying water and stuff like that, I think",1
"It just got me really interested, and I saw that practical living out that I was looking for earlier",1
And then I went back home and looked for ways to do it too,1
And got involved in urban farming,0
"Like, you were talking about with the leaders, I think it is important to get them on board",1
I think a lot of people on churches look to them strongly - as perhaps they should - for advice and leadership on how to live,1
"If churches want to be ahead of this issue then their leaders need to be able to speak about it, and so my hope would be that they find a way to feel comfortable and feel knowledgeable about those issues and help the congregants follow along",1
"I would say, people my age really care about it",1
"You know, you hear a lot about us -- us as in millennials or whatever you want to call it leaving the church",1
"So, my message to a church leader would be",1
"I mean, it kind of sounds like blackmail but if you want us to stay, you got to get on board with some of these issues and start helping us figure out ways to reconcile our faith with a way to live in the world, that makes sense to us and is better for the earth",1
"We love you, we love God, we love the earth, and we just all want to be together on it, I think you see a lot of young people not voting",1
"And I think, everybody knows that",0
"Um, and part of that is because we dont trust you",0
if Im speaking to a political leader,1
"And you, as in the body that represents all government",1
have this feeling inside that Im not enough,0
"It triggers that emotion and so understanding that, I can actually say, okay Im not enough",1
"Thats definitely a lie and I can let it go I can let it go, which brings me to the next step",0
"Step number two is, managing your emotions",1
This step might for some of you on this new journey of emotions and emotional intelligence might feel counterintuitive,1
"But let me tell you, as you practice this, it will become a powerhouse tool for you",1
"Managing your emotions is the ability to allow yourself to feel your emotions, to feel what youre feeling without judging yourself",1
"Thats really really important because when you judge the emotion that youre feeling the negative emotion that youre feeling, it anchors it in",1
It actually causes it to last longer,1
but thats the way it is,0
"So you can make posts, you can make videos, and people are just like, No, thats, no I dont believe you",0
You know why this probably happens,0
Because were under the age of 60 years old,0
"People will believe old people like that but if youre younger, no youre too young to do this",0
There are a few things that you need to understand about the role of income and employment in obtaining home financing in todays market.,1
The days of stated income are long gone.,1
These days you are required to provide proof of income and employment in order to obtain home financing.,0
The type of proof varies depending on the types of income you receive.,0
"If you follow this link or go to our Additional Resources section, you will find a document that tells you exactly which types of documentation you will need to provide as proof of income and employment.",1
Lenders are looking at your consistency and continuity of employment.,1
They want to look back two years and ahead 2-3 years to determine whether or not youve had stable and consistent employment.,1
"Any kinds of gaps in employment, any kind of frequent job changes will all need to be explained thoroughly to the lenders.",1
Marquez knows it wasnt red mist that caused the incident.,0
"Its very clear from the helicopter footage that I didnt want to make him crash, I just wanted to make him lose time, go outside of the line and slow down, because he was playing his dirty game, even worse than in Australia.",0
"When I went wide and slowed down to nearly a stop, I looked at him as if to say what are you doing?. After that we touched.",0
He touched with his right underarm on my leg and my foot slipped off the foot peg.,1
"If you look at the image from the helicopter its clear that when my foot slipped of the foot peg, Marquez had already crashed.",1
"I didnt want to kick him, especially because, if you give a kick to a MotoGP bike, it wont crash, its very heavy.",0
"For me the sanction is not fair, because Marquez won his fight.",0
His program is OK because he is making me lose the championship.,0
"The sanction is not good, especially for me, because I didnt purposefully want to make him crash, I just reacted to his behaviour, but I didnt kick him.",0
"Boy, there was a lot of reading in this program.",1
"And all of it was new for me, so some of it I had to read over and over.",1
"When youre looking at a new subject and youre learning it for the first time, read through it once without taking notes, and then go back over it maybe with a highlighter or with the idea of taking notes.",1
"I would usually make it once through the reading if I had time to do it before the class, but I would never go back and try to read the whole chapter again.",1
I would go back and focus on certain things that were brought up in class.,1
The British people have decided to leave the European Union.,1
"As it defines the next chapter in its relationship with the EU, I know that the United Kingdoms position in NATO will remain unchanged.",1
"The UK will remain a strong and committed NATO Ally, and will continue to play its leading role in our Alliance.",1
"Today, as we face more instability and uncertainty, NATO is more important than ever as a platform for cooperation among European Allies, and between Europe and North America.",1
"A strong, united and determined NATO remains an essential pillar of stability in a turbulent world, and a key contributor to international peace and security.",1
"STEPHEN O’KANE: The Auditor General is an independent statutory officer that reports to the parliament and his role is to provide reviews under the Audit Act of public sector management and activities, with a view to looking at financial accountability but also efficiency and effectiveness.",1
The Ombudsman is another important statutory officer who reports to the parliament and the Ombudsman’s office provides reviews of the application and management of public sector resources and also responds to complaints and issues raised by members of the public.,1
but dont get discouraged yet because they actually dont know what kind of number in that test are great or bad,1
They rank the candidates on the basis of the type of applications they get,1
"If they get applications where people couldnt even clear the GATE, but you could, then you are in luck",1
My final advice would be to apply to as many Universities as you can if your grades are not that great,1
A Grade Point of 8-9 is considered very good and you will have no problem in applying to the University,1
But we all know the struggle of getting that kind of grades in India,1
Its really no joke,1

Hi Im Dr. Simcha Shapiro here with Expert Village.,1
Now were going to talk about an Osteopathic technique called strain counter strain.,1
Now strain counter strain was developed in the 70s by Lawrence Jones.,1
Strain counter strain was developed in the 70s by Lawrence Jones and the basis to the technique is to shorten the muscle that were working with in order to release it and to reset the pain mechanism.,1
"Well, there are great opportunities for marketers to really recognize that self expression has become the new entertainment.",1
"So while there are many people who are still wondering, “Why are people spending all this time editing Wikipedia entries, or uploading video on their Facebook profiles or blogging on the Huffington Post?” The answer is they love it.",0
In bankruptcy we often deal with the situation where cars have more equity then is the exemption available to apply to the car.,1
So I want to talk for a minute about ways that we can deal with that situation.,1
First of all lets just real quickly define what we mean by the word equity.,1
And equity is simply taking the value of the item in this case the car minus what is owed on it.,1
"So if somebody owns a car that’s worth $5,000 and they have a $3,000 car loan $5,000 minus $3,000 the equity in the car is $2,000. So what do we do in a situation where the amount of equity in the car is greater than the amount of exemption that we have to apply to it.",0
Because if we don’t do anything they’re going to owe the trustee that non-exempt equity amount.,1
So there’s several things that we can do.,0
I’m going to talk about two which are probably the most common.,1
"One is the individual can trade the car in on a new car, newer car, just to make sure that they don’t end up with more equity in the new car than they have exemption and we do that very, very often.",1
"Another scenario that we follow that we do quite often, is the best way to describe it is to use an example.",1
"Let’s say we have our $5,000 car and the person doesn’t owe anything on it.",1
The car is free and clear.,1
"When it comes to speaker selections, there are tons and tons of choices out there.",1
As disciples of Jesus we are called to be SALT and LIGHT to be ambassadors for HIM and to bring MORE people to JESUS that they would be led by Jesus and obey HIM FULLY!,1
We are NOT called to elevate ourselves or our families or anything else but to be pleasing to Jesus.,1
"It seems for the most part people have used the internet, including Christians only to glorify themselves, to promote themselves.",1
"They are stuck in pornography and in sin, rather than using the internet like Facebook or Youtube for the glory of Jesus.",0
It is a SAD thing because the devil is using Christians to spread his gospel.,0
"Yet Christians are NOT choosing to obey Jesus, their eye is no longer the lamp of lamp of their body, but their eye is BAD so everything they are putting out is bad it is evil.",0
"If you choose to follow Jesus you HAVE to surrender to HIM, be salt and light, be a testimony for Jesus.",0
Clean up your sight or delete it.,0
Either be a testimony for Jesus on the internet or get off.,0
&gt;&gt;MORGAN: Hi there!,1
My name is Morgan McLellan and i just completed the eight week BuiltLean program.,1
Let me just say this program has changed my entire life.,1
I have never had so much confidence.,1
"I mean, for the first time, I can take my shirt off and not feel self conscious about my body.",1
No more swimming with T-shirts on.,1
"I know, it was crazy to begin with!",1
"Now, the BuiltLean program doesnt promise you to lose three pounds in 30 days, you know, they dont deliver frozen food to your house, but what it does deliver on is this: The most comprehensive guide you can find anywhere to getting into the best shape in your life.",1
This is another of my favorite albums,1

"In my undergraduate degree; I did a Chemistry undergraduate degree, as part of that we do kinetics and specifically, at my university, we did atmospheric kinetics.",1
"I really enjoyed that, but I didnt enjoy the atmospheric application, so when I found out, eventually, through my industrial placement that there was this pharmacokinetics area (which is the kinetics of drugs in the body), I really enjoyed that.",1
"It combines parts of Biology, Chemistry and Maths, so I really enjoyed an area which is quite diverse and brought all these aspects together.",1
"It seems to me, one of the simple keys to success in connecting with the consumer in the automobile business is consistency.",0
"be because eventually, theyre human beings",1
So it sounds a little different,1
"So in my world, I know its called recruiting in everybodys world but we need guys that are great football players",1
We need guys that are great students,1
"We want great human beings, all right",1
"Thats the trifecta, we want all three",1
"But if they dont buy in to what we do and how we do it, its a waste of time for him, its a waste of time for us",1
Because our culture will be set by the daily practices of the people that live there,0
"If they dont work as hard as we need them to, if they dont prioritize the scholastic part of being a college football student, student athlete",1
They are not going to make it here,0
And they may drag a couple of other people down,0
"This is financial adviser Patrick Munro, talking about the goal of financial management.",1
The goal of financial management should be two fold.,0
"around Cory about sand under the climbing structure, I know I can come to Cory and say, Hey, what happened",1
This morning there was some sand under the climbing structure,1
How come you didnt sweep,1
"And Cory could say, I had a had a late pick-up yesterday",1
And that gives me an idea that she didnt do it on purpose,1
And so part of this team is that we assume the best of everyone,1
The children dont break things because they want to break them,1
Children dont that children done dont break things because they want of a children bite each other because they want to buy each other,1
And we put that practice into our own relationships,1
Its okay to have struggles and I think for us teachers we somehow in this profession we have decided that its not okay to struggle,1
I guess you could say its an occupational hazard,0
"When Im out with my friends, the last thing I want to worry about is an overdraft fee on my account.",1

In this title I want to talk a little bit about up conversion of DVDs and what that kind of is.,0
"With HD DVD players and Blu-ray players, they automatically take your standard definition disk or content, say a TV show or a movie that youve bought.",1
"Your older DVDs, your regular DVDs and they will take those and play those back just like they would their HD or Blu-ray disks that they were designed for.",1
The only difference is they will take that signal and actually make the image larger in the disk.,1
What they do is they double the amount of resolution or the amount of lines that that disk was made with to display optimally on your HD TV set.,1
Now what happens is your standard definition content is at four hundred and eighty lines.,1
"Hey guys, this is Brodie Arldt",1
"I will be doing a eulogy over my grandfather, so here it is",0
"For those of yall who dont know me Im Brodie Arldt, Raymonds grandson",1
"My grandfather lived a life full of faithfulness, happiness, pride, and joy",1
"He would serve two years for the United States Army in World War II He would then return to Texas to marry my grandmother, Betty Packorny, of Pflugerville, on August twelfth, nineteen fourty-seven",1
"In nineteen fifty-seven he would have his first daughter, my aunt, Pamela Blaha",1

"In nineteen ninety-one, Raymond became a grandpa",1
"His daughter Pam and son-in-law Mark had a baby girl,later on in 1993 having a second",1
"It wasnt until 1996, that I first met my Pa-Paw",1
At that moment my Pa-Paw knew I was something special,1
Mainly because I would be his only grandson,0
There are many memories Pa-Paw and I would share,0
One of my favorite memories is when he took me for the first time to go fishing down at the stock tank,1
From that day on I have always loved to fish,1
"I was very fortunate to be his sideman when it came to working cattle, fixing fence, working on the barn, working on the truck, just basically anything",1
I was always there right beside him and I was lucky to have him,1
Another memory I have is when he let me drive his old farm pick-up,1
That thing was standard so it took us all day just to learn how to drive it,1
He never let me give up though,1
He always just smiled and laughed and said you can do this and then he would re-teach me,1
We spent that whole day just driving that truck around the pasture until I finally learned how to do it These are some of the memories I will hold close to me and cherish,1
"Anyone who knew my grandfather knows of his generosity, work ethic, humility, and selflessness",0
He demonstrated these traits again and again throughout his whole life,0
"He also demonstrated these traits through working on a farm, the war, or at Montgomery Ward where he worked for 32 years",1
"Whatever my Pa-Paw was involved in, he made sure it was done the right way, that no corners were cut, and he made sure that everyone was happy",1
My Pa-Paw was the one man I looked up to,1
When I grew up I wanted to be just like him,1
"Everything I learned, I learned from my Pa-Paw",1
"In conclusion to this eulogy, Pa-Paw you will be missed dearly",1
Someday I hope to become half the man you were,1
People like my Pa-Paw are one in a million,0
"Anyone who was around him knew of his work ethic, his big heart, generosity, and selflessness",0
"So let us celebrate my Pa-Paws life, and continue his legacy",0

And basically what Im going to talk about today is branding,1
Why its necessary in your video and basically ways that you can do it,1
So as you can see guys Ive got a bit of branding into this video,1
Branding is really important when you make any videos because you want people to remember you if youve got a logo thats memorable youve got a slogan thats memorable try and get it into your video,1
"The easiest way, as you can see, is branded shirts",1
"If you get your branded shirt in, if youve got a branded shirt put them on",1
Put your videos together using them it also means that you can make a sequence of videos at the same time not worry about looking the same because its a branded shirt,1
You can also see that Ive got my Clockwork Eye logo in there and because Ive actually made these videos tailored for the Trades Hub members Ive actually got a nudge there towards the Trades Hub by putting my certificate on the wall behind me,1
Now you can over do your branding so what I recommend is that you basically keep it nice and simple nice and subliminal and then dont over do it okay guys,1

They have not heeded my call.,1

Israel rejects the absurd decision of the ICC prosecutor.,0
"It’s absurd for the ICC to ignore international law and agreements, Under which the Palestinians dont have a state and can only get one through direct negotiations with Israel.",1
The rules of the ICC are clear: No state  No standing  No case.,0
"It’s absurd for the ICC to go after Israel, which upholds the highest standards of international law Our actions are subject to the constant and careful review of Israels world-renowned and utterly independent legal system.",0
But this decision is even more preposterous given that Israel is legitimately defending itself against Palestinian terrorists who routinely commit multiple war crimes.,0
"They deliberately fire thousands of rockets at our civilians, while hiding behind Palestinian civilians whom they use a human shield And heres the ultimate folly of this decision – It is the democracy of Israel, a world leader in fighting terrorism, which is to be hauled to the dock in The Hague, While the terrorist war criminals of Hamas are the ones who are going to be pressing the charges.",0
"I wont be surprised if ISIS, al-Qaida and Hezbollah follow suit.",0

"The second one is to create, as the chief human relations officer, to create the kind of company and build the organization that can actually accomplish the strategy.",1

Hi this is Rhett Reiger White Caspian studios on behalf of Expert Village.,1
I want to talk for a minute about the shoot in general.,0
Now this is the meat of being a director.,1
You are on the shoot.,1
Im Principal Sisson and this is Associate Principal Marni Johnson,1
We are here to visit with you about the current state of Hersey High School,1
At this point in time our students are going to begin the registration process,1
So I thought I would invite Marni to talk to you all about what that entails so that you would have some idea of the decisions that youll have with your children in the coming weeks and months,1
So it seems kind of crazy that at this time of year after we just started the new year that we are already talking about next year,1
Come November our current sophomores will start selecting their courses for next year including their elective courses and teachers are making recommendations for core classes for next year,1
"Our counselors will be going into classrooms for each grade level distributing course material, talking about course selections and then they go through the process of meeting with every student individually and this takes place from November until January at which time then hopefully all of our students have selected courses",1
This is an important process because this helps drive our master schedule,1
Our master schedule is hopefully based off of what students needs and students wants are and we try to build a schedule that works most appropriately with all the requests that we receive,1
Our hope is that all kids get the courses that they wish for the following year,1
We have other things going on at Hersey as well that I would like to mention,1
We have our annual food drive that is about to take place which is an exciting time for Hersey,1
Our Service Over Self organization does a fantastic job with that effort and initiative,1
We have a lot of academic concepts if you will happening,1
We are looking at dual credit courses with Harper College which is an exciting concept for us,1
Where students could hopefully accumulate 15 credits over the course of their high school years which gives them a higher chance or probability of doing well in a college environment and so were excited to be rolling those out with this registration process as well,1
I would encourage you to keep your children focused on the rest of the semester,1
It is a semester thats fractured with a lot of holidays and a lot of breaks in it,1
We need to finish the semester as well as we can,1
"Stay focused, stay intent on your studies with all that goes on around you",1
A lot of great activities -- we are wrapping up our fall sports season,1
We are beginning our winter sports season,1
We have some outstanding efforts from our kids,1
We offer so many things for so many kids,1
Its real heartening to see the opportunities that you help provide for your children,1
So we thank you for that and we do our best to continue the work for your children that we find significant and important,1

"Ive sort of come from a bit of a background in the public service and I think theres, in foreign policy, theres a bit of a disconnect between the foreign policy for public service and what happens in academia.",0
And I think thats what sort of drove my interest just to try and bridge that difference.,1
And I think the way to go about doing that is trying to make some of our foreign policy research actually practical for foreign policy practitioners.,1
So thats whats driving my research.,1
"To actually make some recommendations as to how their processes can be improved, how the process of foreign policy making can be opened up, to incorporate other voices and other actors.",1
And also improve work for the big bureaucracy itself.,1
So Selena if that is your real name I just wanted to let you know because I think youve forgotten  who your dealing with.,0
"you take general communication classes, such as intercultural communication",1
"Speech 26 is about diversity issues in the United States and about basically taking a reflective position on how we live through, and with, diversity",1
If you are interested in helping the speech traditionally maybe youve seen the movies stuttering is a very serviceable area for speech pathologists,1
"When I was three, I was diagnosed with severe stuttering",0
"and I had a speech pathologist come to help me with my speech, so I want to the thing for other kids",1
"Children sometimes are delayed in their language, so a speech pathologist will help with that",0

They could walk in whenever they wanted.,0
"And it was after, like I said, two to three hours, that all of a sudden, here comes a little double-cab Toyota pickup with seven gendarmes in the back, in their little red berets.",1
What a welcome sight these guys were.,0
All it is is no one told him it was inappropriate,1
But try that next time you get pulled over,0
"Oh, I saw the stop sign, officer, but I didnt know it meant stop driving",0
"Hi, my name is Fan Li.",1
"Or is this something thats just an artifact of our data, just statistical noise",1
"Well, to answer that, we have to do some statistical inference",1
"Now, in here, in these brackets, we see the number of observations in each group",1
"So those numbers are pretty small, so thats why we might be worried that this number here is just statistical noise and is not an actual effect",1
"So were going to have to do the confidence interval for that, and that Ive drawn right here",1
Ive got our average treatment effect estimate of -0,1
We often get a question about how is my corporation or LLC going to be taxed at the federal government level.,1
The short answer with an LLC is a single member LLC defaults to disregarded status.,1
It doesnt mean its a disregarded entity for liability reasons.,1
It means its disregarded for tax reasons.,1
"So in other words, theres no separate tax return to file for your LLC if youre a single member LLC.",1
"All the income goes on the Schedule C of your personal 1040. Should you have a partnership which is a multimember LLC, then you will file a 1065 which is the federal partnership tax return.",1
One advantage of the LLC is its allowed to do things called check the box.,1
"So they can also elect, an LLC can elect, to an S-corporation status for tax reasons or a C-corporation for tax reasons.",1
"So even though you still have an LLC, you can file a tax return with all the advantages of an S-Corp or a C-Corp, and its amazing the flexibility you have with an LLC.",1
"&gt;&gt; I was a resident in neurosurgery, and I was at Duke University, and I did an operation on a patient with one of my attending called deep brain stimulation.",1
"And the next day, I was on my rounds, as residents are, and going into rooms and seeing how people are.",1
"And I walked into this gentlemans room, and he was crying.",1
"And at first, I was really concerned, because I was like, why is this patient crying?",1
"And he looked at me, and I asked him, you know, Mr. So and So, why are you crying?",1
"He said, well, you know, I just wrote the first letter Ive written my granddaughter in 10 years.",1
Because he had something called essential tremor.,1
"An essential tremor is a disease in which the harder you try to do something, the more your hand shakes.",1
And so he wasnt able to write a letter to his granddaughter.,1
"And all of a sudden after this operation, he was able to.",0
"Well, that really struck a chord, and I ended up a functional neurosurgeon who does deep brain stimulation.",0
"After I finished my residency, I was looking for a place that was going to be able to combine all of my research interest with all of my clinical interest.",1
"And so I looked at various fancy places on the East Coast and got a couple of really nice offers, actually.",1
And I was thinking hard about them.,1
"Heres an idea, hurricanes are bad.",1
So Hurricane Sandy has passed.,0
"Im very lucky, I didnt even lose power or internet, but I am trapped in Brooklyn.",1
"Mass transit is shut down, the mayor is telling people not to drive, so it might be a little while before the next Idea Channel gets posted.",0
So I thought I would make a fun little thing in my apartment here with my own fake Idea Channel wall.,1
But real Idea Channel updates might be a little slow.,1
"And speaking of updates, um, I forget who it was, but Ill try to figure out and post a link in the description.",1
I saw a really interesting Twitter posted this morning from someone whos saying that they thought reading a trustworthy Twitter feed for five minutes is more informative than watching CNN for a whole half an hour.,0
And this made me realize that I actually spent the entire storm flipping back and forth between watching Undeclared on Netflix and reading Twitter.,0
"And that when the mayor would come on I would flip on the broadcast news and watch him for as long as he was on TV, but for the most part, I was getting my news-- for lack of a better word-- from my friends who were living the storm and posting updates on the internet.",1
"For the last very long time, I think that we think of news as something thats handed down from on high from like a broadcast network or something.",1
Staples are never recommended as a fastener for Western Red Cedar.,0
The next thing you want to look at is education and intellectual level.,1

I just came from a meeting of the Israeli cabinet.,0
We discussed the proposed framework for a deal with Iran.,0
The cabinet is united in strongly opposing the proposed deal.,0
This deal would pose a grave danger to the region and to the world and would threaten the very survival of the State of Israel.,0
"The deal would not shut down a single nuclear facility in Iran, would not destroy a single centrifuge in Iran and will not stop R&amp;D on Irans advanced centrifuges.",1
On the contrary.,0
The deal would legitimize Irans illegal nuclear program.,1
It would leave Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure.,0
A vast nuclear infrastructure remains in place.,0
The deal would lift sanctions almost immediately And this at the very time that Iran is stepping up its aggression and terror in the region &amp; beyond the region.,0
"In a few years, the deal would remove the restrictions on Irans nuclear program, Enabling Iran to have a massive enrichment capacity that it could use to produce many nuclear bombs within a matter of months The deal would greatly bolster Irans economy.",0
It would give Iran thereby tremendous means to propel its aggression and terrorism throughout the Middle East.,0
Hi Im Governor Tom Wolf Im in Penn Treaty School in Philadelphia and this has been quite a week.,1
On Tuesday I kicked off the new budget session with my budget speech and basically what I talked about was just the honest truth.,1
We have a real budget crisis that were facing here in Pennsylvania.,0
"For years the outside rating agencies, the Independent Fiscal Office -- everybodys been saying we have not had a balanced budget.",1
We need to change that.,1
And I said that on Tuesday.,0
"Once we balance our budget, we have to make sure that were investing the dollars we raised wisely.",1
"If we dont -- we dont invest wisely -- were going to be hurting our schools, were going to be hurting basically our future.",0
"Now, there might thirty percent or so of the school districts in Pennsylvania who are wealthy enough that they dont have to worry about making ends meet.",0
They dont worry about the state doing its share in terms of education funding.,0
"But, on average, Pennsylvania ranks 45th in terms of the states share of funding for education.",0
"That means in most school districts, the local areas -- the local taxpayers -- have to come up with the lions share of support and in poorer areas they just dont get the support they need.",1
We need to have an education system that works all of us in Pennsylvania.,0
"Im from York County, I need Penn Treaty here in Philadelphia to work.",1
"I was in Altoona, I was in Clairton -- those school districts have to work.",1
"This is Patrick Munro, Financial Advisor, talking to you about what are negotiable certificates of deposit.",1

SCOTT DUPONT: Scott duPont.,1
Welcome back to Film Producing 101 on behalf of Expert Village.,1
So the next topic were going to talk about here is getting a few key crew members.,1
How to build a team so to speak.,1
The debt ratio tells us the proportion of assets financed with debt.,1
A debt ratio of 0.50 means that debt finances half the assets.,1
The higher the debt ratio the greater the pressure to pay interest and principal.,1
The debt ratio is a measure of solvency.,1
"In general, a debt ratio of less than 30%  suggest a company isn’t as efficient as it could be,  whereas a ratio more than 75% , lets say,  suggests possible bankruptcy, if a company experiences a downturn in business.",1
The debt ratio is calculated as total liabilities divided by total assets.,0
It tells us what percentage of assets are financed with debt.,1
"On average, most debt ratios are around 60%  as companies tend to finance more assets with debt than equity.",1
This is mainly due to debt tax advantages.,0
Interest expense is tax-deductible for businesses.,1
What to do about challenging audiences?,1
"Well heres the first thing to know, most audiences arent challenging.",1
Most audiences will become challenging if theyre bored or if they feel that the presenter isnt on their side or delivering information thats of value to them.,1
"But the fact is, most audiences want the presenter to do a good job.",0
"Curious, moody boys and girls Struggling alone in other country Away from home, friends and family Yo guys, guess what",1
"Hey guys, Matt from Sales4U here If you have any reports to give to clients, if you have a service company, if you are building a product and you want to show the progress, the RAG report is going to be tremendously helpful",1
"RAG stands for Red, Amber, Green, so three colours",1
"The green is everything is good, its been done",1
"amber means its in progress, red means its urgent, theres something to address theres a problem, theres an issue, were going to be late",0
Thats a report that I send before the weekly call with the client,1
"so usually the day right before the call just to give them an update of whats going on and left to do the progress that I made So I will send you the template for it if you want it, you can email me at matt@sales4u",1
"BENJAMIN CARDIN: First, let me agree with Sen",1
"Corker that it is not right for millionaires and billionaires to pay effective tax rates of 10 or 15 percent, when a laborer working 40 hours a week is paying at a 28 percent",1
So I think we can find some common agreement to make sure that everyone is paying their fair share of taxes,1
We can close some of these loopholes,1
And I also think we need to take a look at rates,0
"On entitlement reform, we have already started down that path with the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare",0
We need to change the way we deliver health care in America,0
"And in doing that, we reduce the cost of health care, we reduce the readmissions to hospitals, we do a better job on using technology, less tests",0
We manage the more complicated medical interventions,0
We reduce hospital infection rates,0
Theres a lot of ways that you can reduce health care costs,1
"These three bins and color-coded dot stickers, which Ill provide a link below in the description on where you can get these in like 25 different colors",1

"VICTOR, FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICER, ECONOMIC CAREER TRACK: My name is Victor, Im a Foreign Service Officer in the Economic career track.",1
"Ive always been interested in economic issues, especially economic recovery after some war or other type of crisis.",1
"And with the Economic career track,  you get a chance to go overseas and report on whatever important economic issues are going on at that time.",1
"So you get to be sort of like the Secretary of States own Financial Times reporter, or something like that, which is really exciting to me, to be the eyes and ears of U.S.",1
decision makers.,1
"My path to get into this career came through one of the Departments fellowship programs, the Pickering Fellowship.",1
"I entered the undergraduate program in 2002, and the program included some summer enrichment opportunities, such as a domestic and an overseas internship.",1
"I worked domestically at the office that deals with failed states, which really highlights my interest in economic recovery.",1
"And then overseas, I worked in Ghana, a very exciting summer during the World Cup, and got a chance to cover economic issues related to arms smuggling.",1
Well Im now in my second assignment.,1
"My first assignment was as a Consular Officer in Hong Kong; it gave me a chance to see crises not on a... on a broad scale level, because Hong Kong is a very easy-to-live place, but on a... on a small-scale, personal level, because Consular Officers often see people who are in personal crises -- Americans who have been hospitalized or imprisoned abroad.",1
"Now in my second assignment, I have the...sort of a global portfolio.",1
"Im a Watch Officer, so I work in the Secretarys of States 24-hour operations center.",1
And our job is to keep decision makers informed about issues all... that are happening all over the world.,1
"&gt;&gt; REBECCA BONDOR: One of the most significant things that happened to me here at Miami was I wrote a puppet script as a senior thesis, and the professor encouraged me to turn it into a full-out production.",1
"So she said, why dont you partner with people in the Theatre Department?",1
So I recruited 4 actors as the puppeteers.,1
I built all the marionettes.,1
I built the stage.,1
And we had 3 weekend performances.,1
And this show was so successful that it gave me the confidence to write all of the puppeteer companies that were listed in The New Yorker magazine.,1
"And lo and behold, one wrote me back and said, if I was willing to move all my stuff to New York at my own expense, I could work for them and tour the schools with their marionette company.",1
They were a well-established marionette company that paid.,1
"So I said, oh, okay, that sounds like a good idea.",1
"I love childrens writing and if theyll let me, itll be an opportunity to move to New York.",1
So I did and I worked then as a puppeteer for several years.,1
"Hi, Mike Johnson from Vexxt Business Growth One of the things that I wanted to give you a tip on today is what we call the premium pricing option.",1
You always hear about upselling and adding to each customers purchase.,1
"But, sometimes people are leery of doing that.",1
They feel like they are coming on too strong if they ask someone to purchase something else.,0
This is Patrick Munro talking about current CD rates.,0
As a Financial Advisor I see financial rates and terms changing in this ever changing financial landscape.,1
We went on vacation to Brigantine New Jersey,1
We were walking with her on a boardwalk and there was a gentleman who was roasting peanuts,1
And they were blowing the smell of the peanuts out on the boardwalk,1
That was when she had her first full-fledged anaphylactic episode,1
A couple of months ago he went into anaphylaxis after drinking his older sisters regular milk,0
His stomach started to hurt and then he started to throw up,0
And we could hear her throat starting to close,0
Im haunted by that sound,0
She told me you know you need to give her the EpiPen and uh it was the hardest thing I ever had to do,0
"We kept second guessing ourselves but once his lip and his tongue started swelling, we knew that was it",0
"Yeah, that we had to give it",0
We had no choice,0
He jabbed her with the EpiPen and uh she cried and he cried and Ive never seen him cry it was just awful,0
"I cried like a baby it was uh she looked at me like No Daddy, you know because I had to poke her with this needle",0
"When the squad got there the guy was looking at him and said Oh yeah he looks fine now! No, still we gotta go to the hospital, you dont understand",0
"shared success or something, so even something like yeah this all the things I appreciate in him, its like I share a bit less of the joy or something",1
- Two of my best pieces of advice for musicians and creative people who want to share their work online and grow their audience and grow their engagement ^using digital strategy is to just start ^and not overthink it,1
"^And this can apply to everything, whether it is sending an email blast to your list that you havent talked to in two years or starting a YouTube channel, or running an ad campaign for your next record thats coming out, just start",1
I think a lot of us have a tendency to sit and wait and wonder and worry and research and talk to everybody we know to get their input and try to figure out the right way to do it and then you look back and months have passed and you still havent done the thing that you want to do,1
"And so by just starting it, you actually are moving forward and youre seeing what works and the great thing about these digital tools is you get stats right away, you can see whos responding on social media or you can see if anyones actually clicking on your ad, if anyones actually buying the thing you want them to buy",1
"You get the stats right away, its great",1
"Even if you have a total crash and burn ad campaign, you learn a lot from it and your next ones gonna to be better",1
"^And once you get started, just keep going",1
^It can definitely take the wind out of your sails if youve put money into an ad campaign for the first time or youve spent a lot of time on an email and youve sent it out to your huge list and theres no response or the response isnt what you wanted,1
It can be really disappointing and so its hard to try again if it didnt have the response that you wanted it to have,1
So just keep going,1
Ways that I keep going with my projects and I advise to my clients is just ^this concept of accountability,1
"^How can you hold yourself accountable to do the goals that you want? Because we all sort of by default, if things get stressful, dont do stuff",1
"And so how can you kind of trick your brain to make it happen? Accountability, and one way that Ive done that ^is to just set a schedule",1
"^And maybe for social media, its saying that you want to post to Twitter eight times a week or you want to post a new YouTube channel once a week",1
Set a schedule that seems reasonable for you and then just do it,1
^Accountability can also come from ^a connection with another person,1
"^This could maybe be your publicist or your manager, if you have the relationship where youre talking regularly, check in and have them sort of hold you responsible that you get stuff done before your next call with them and its sort of like youve got that assignment",1
"But if you dont have that, you could also just create that with other members of your ensemble, maybe you delegate who works on which things and you have a weekly check in meeting amongst all of you to see if everybodys doing what they need to be doing and how you can do better the next week",1
Or just a colleague or a friend whos doing similar work,1
You can get on the phone once a week,1
I really think that weekly calls or even just a few times a month can be really helpful with checking in and making sure youre staying on track with what you want to do,1
So I talk to people all day long about the power of online video to share your story with the world and so Im taking my own advice here ^and starting this new YouTube channel,1
"^Hello, Im Adrienne Stortz, this is my new YouTube channel about digital marketing strategy for musicians",1
"^So as youve been watching this video, ^whats the thing that popped into your brain that you have been wanting to just start but youve been putting off or making excuses or over-researching?

"Hi guys, Bridget from Money After Graduation here and I wanted to talk to you about getting started investing",1
So many young people stay out of the stock market because theyre intimidated by its complexity or they think they dont have enough money to get started investing,1
And as a result they miss out on hundreds of thousands of dollars of potential returns over their lifetime,1
You cant afford not to invest if you want to enjoy any kind of long term financial security,0
"Thankfully, theres a lot of options available to you to get started no matter what your situation or understanding of the market",0
The first and easiest way to get started investing is mutual funds,1
These are typically available directly from your bank and you can start with as little as $50,1
"In a mutual fund, youre actually giving your money over to a fund manager who invests it in a series of stocks or other investments on your behalf",1
"As a result, mutual funds typically come with some higher fees, but it really takes the load off you doing the stock picking individually so it might be a good option for you",1
"When youre selecting mutual funds, look very closely at the fees so you know exactly how much youre paying",1
"These fees will be listed as the MER or mer fee, and you want to try to stay around 1%",1
A lot of mutual funds will have these fees as high as 3% or 4%,0
"Stay away from those, you cant afford to have that much of your return eaten up by fees",0
"If you have a little bit more money to invest, and want to pay less fees, your next choice is a roboadvisor",1
"These are awesome online wealth management tools that you need about $1,000 to get started in a portfolio",1
"All you need to do is deposit your money, and they take care of the rest, just like a mutual fund, except for at a much lower cost",1
"For a roboadvisor, you can typically expect to spend somewhere between 0",1
"Finally, the last option to get started investing is to open your own brokerage account",1
If you bank with a large financial institution they might be able to offer you their own brokerage account but otherwise you might have to look for an online brokerage provider,1
"When you have a brokerage account, your actually responsible for doing all the investing yourself",1
"This means you have to choose your stocks and ETFs, you have to decide when to buy and sell, and your responsible for managing all your taxes and so on",0
"If that sounds like too much work, then the roboadvisor or the mutual funds are probably a better option for you, but if you want to be more in control of your money and pay the least amount of fees possible, then a brokerage account is the right fit",1
"To get started, youll only need about $1,000 and you can begin trading right away",1
If you want to learn how to invest in the stock market theres plenty of different resources online and off that you could use,1
Theres plenty of investing books and Ill leave some in the description below so you can know some of my favorites that I learned to get started in the stock market,1
I also offer a series of investing eCourses that will help you as well,1
"Its also not uncommon for investing classes to be offered as part of adult continuing education at local universities, so make sure to check those out as well",1
I hope you guys found this video helpful and are feeling a little more confident about looking at your investing options,1
Really remember the only investing mistake you can make right now is not investing at all,1

"Hi, I’m Steve Freeman with GreatBusinessContent",1
Lately I’ve been blogging about building a customer base from scratch,1
What follows is my interview with Bret Tuck co-owner of Edely’s Bar-b-que in Nashville Tennessee,1
"Bret talks about how he defined his customer base, and then developed a product line to keep them coming back",1
Let’s listen to what Bret has to say,0
"After I got done with business school I sat down with my parents and told them that I actually wanted to learn a trade, versus just information on how to make money",1
"So, that’s when I decided to go to culinary art school",1
The reason I chose to get into a bar-restaurant or this style is because I know I can cook well,1
I was in fine dining for a long time,1
"So I took the fine dining attitude to making stuff taste good, plate presentation and all that stuff",1
"Then, tone it down so you can put a really good tasting meal on a plate for a decent price",1
"I think with that concept, especially with the way the American cuisine is going, I think that’s just a hit concept",1
That your client or your customers are just a huge wide base,1
"I think that’s where a lot of restaurants get into trouble is cause they shoot for either fine dining, where only this style of people will come in, or they shoot for the Subway Franchise, which that all still make money in certain ways, and they get that low income customer coming in and quality and stuff is an issue",1
"Versus high end where quality is not the issue, , just the amount of people who are going to be able to pay for it",1
"I think you take those skills and you come up with a concept that really reaches the customer whether it’s a family with young kids or whether it’s a family with college kids, whether it’s college kids, 35 year olds and up, and all the way up to seniors, senior citizens",1
This concept really hit all of them,1
So literally we have times during the day that at 5:00 you have young children with their parents coming in from about 5:15 to 5:30 – 6:30,1
"Then about 6:30 to 7:30 we have that middle age group comes in and then, or I’m sorry the elderly come in and then come around 8:00 you get all the college come in that want to have a beer and dinner",1
"Thanks Bret, good information",1
"Did you find this information useful? If so please comment below, we can get a conversation going",1
"Before you leave today I going to ask you a favor, hit the like button, share this video with your friends and colleagues, and subscribe to the website",1

In the last two years I have been focusing on building myself,1
"I got to a high position in a technological organization, but something is still missing",1
"I can talk about my experience as I previously did on the format attached However, I would rather use this time in order to give you a sneak peek into my head",1
When I was young my mother told me that the only way to achieve the impossible Is first to believe it is possible,1
"from this moment forward, I have been dreaming to change the world",1
I believe that with the technology we have today we can find a way to live among nature and not instead of it,1
"In order to fulfill my dream, I need your help",1
"I need knowledge, guidance and atmosphere of people that wakes up every morning knowing that they can make a difference in this world",1
thats exactly what I was missing,1
"Entrepreneurship holds inside leadership, hunger for creation but most importantly The ability to fail without losing your enthusiasm",1
"I have known myself 24 years and i have no doubt, my place is between the IDC walls",1

"Well, the franchise is notorious for having subpar completion rewards",0
"Particularly Sonic Generations, which is a rival battle, and other games just giving you a song",1

"A pop culture icon, the moustachioed plumber hit the scene as jump man in Donkey Kong, and later was renamed to Mario, getting his own arcade game in 1988, Mario Bros",1
"Through tactics like guerrilla marketing, Nintendo managed to go from having developing 5 arcade games to blowing up in 1985, and even further in 1987 thanks to Super Mario Bros",1

"Hi, I am going to review 3 180 Cosmetics products",1
The first one is this Hyaluronic Acid serum,1
"The second one is the C Booster serum, Vitamin C Booster serum",1
The third one is the moisturizing day cream,1
"First of all, let me say, I have a fairly dry skin and that means that because of that in the T-area of my face I notice how my pores just seem bigger than the pores in the other parts of my face",1
And Ive tried several moisturizers which were OK,1
And than Ive encountered this serum,1
"So in about 5 days of using it, Ive used it twice daily, it managed to even out my skin tone and make the pores seem less visible",1
"And it absorbs beautifully, very fast",1
You put it on and your skin just drinks it up,1
"It is not heavy, its not oily or sticky or icky in any way, its very light but at the same time works very well in tightening your skin up, so I love it! The second serum is the C Booster - ummm, which again by the way got absorbed very quickly and is not oily at all, makes my skin feel very hydrated and less thin so to speak",1
It kind of renews it and fills it with moisture,1
And the skin just feels smooth and hydrated and silky,1
"And the day moisturizing cream works great for me because, well I have dry skin and I need a fair amount of moisture",1
I put it on after the serum in the morning,1
It has both Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid in it by the way,0
So it kind of finishes of the facial treatment and it boosts the moisture up,1
"And it lasts throughout the day, which is important for me because I dont have to worry about moisturizing my skin until the evening treatment",1
I really enjoy these products,1
"I recommend them, especially if you would like to firm your skin up or if you have a more dry type of skin, like I have",1
"So, this serum is just like a moisture injection for your skin, leaves your skin firm, hydrated and relaxed and comfortable and together with the day cream also radiant and it finishes of the treatment very nicely, like Ive said",1

"I think the implications for that one are particularly profound, because were a whole industry thats been typically focused on our ability, as the marketer or the advertiser, to control the message from design development through to production and distribution.",1

"Hi, I’m Danielle from Put a Finish on It, and I’m a freelance copyeditor",1
"What is a copyeditor? Basically put, a copyeditor is someone who works toward making a piece of writing error free",1
"A lot of times when someone has finished writing something, they’ll say, will you proofread this? Or, will you edit this? Editing and proofreading are actually different from each other and from copyediting, even though we all understand that the author wants you to go through her work and correct errors and typos",1
"And just to make things really clear, there is some overlap between proofreading, editing, and copyediting",1
An editor is concerned with the manuscript as whole,1
"If it’s a work of fiction, then its plot structure, its character development, its world-building, its general believability, all that kind of stuff",1
"Reorganizing or restructuring a manuscript is called developmental editing, and if a manuscript needs a lot of rewriting or revision, it needs substantive or content editing",1
Proofreaders are tasked with making sure that errors are not introduced to a text as it moves from its original copy through its iterations to its final published version,1
"While proofreaders are expected to catch typos, they also scrutinize formatting, including line and word breaks, and the type specifications, such as font for headings versus subheadings",1
It’s about the actual print on the page,1
So we’ve gone from focusing on the story with developmental editing to focusing on the actual print with proofreading,1
"According to The Copyeditor’s Handbook author Amy Einsohn, the goal of the copyeditor is to ensure clarity, coherency, consistency, and correctness, all in service of communication",1
"This means that copyeditors perform mechanical editing, making sure that a manuscript conforms to a specific editorial style, or, if you work for a publishing house, a house style",1
Much of the publishing world uses The Chicago Manual of Style as their editorial style guide,1
"Editorial style includes rules for spelling, hyphenation—is a word open, closed, or hyphentated-- capitalization, punctuation, like whether or not to use the serial, or Oxford, comma—and why would you not—treatment of numbers and numerals, and treatment of quotations to name the major ones",1
"Copyeditors make sure all these elements are consistent throughout a manuscript so we don’t have numbers spelled out over here and in numerical form over there, or the same term capitalized on one page and lowercased on another",1
"In addition to mechanical editing, copyeditors also perform language editing, correcting grammar, syntax, and diction",1
"I’ll make sure the correct word is used, and that the sentence means what you want it to mean",1
"And if there’s any question about the author’s intended meaning, I’ll ask",1
Here are a couple things I learned while earning my certification in copyediting,1
"Got that, Siri? And irregardless? Not a word at all",1
The en dash exists—it has very specific uses and it is not the same as a hyphen or dash,1
"And according to the Chicago Manual of Style, With the exception of proper nouns and compounds formed by an adverb ending in ly plus and adjective, it is never incorrect to hyphenate adjectival compounds before a noun",1
And we usually do not hyphenate after the noun,1
"So we have a snow-white dress, but, the dress is snow white, or, a very well-read child, but, the child is well read",1
"I recently read that editing “requires an aptitude, both inherent and acquired, for reading",1
” I love the idea that reading ability is both inherent and acquired,1
"I do have an inherent aptitude for reading, and an acquired one as well",1
"I majored in English and history in college, and both those majors taught me to read critically, with purpose and focus, and a questioning mind",1
And that’s what I still do as a copyeditor,1
Experienced writers will tell you—don’t edit your own manuscript! You’re too close to it to see it critically,1
You’re so familiar with the writing that your eye won’t see a mistake and instead will read it as you expect it to be,1
Of course the language and descriptions are clear to the author—they come from the author’s own mind,1
The copyeditor will let the author know if there’s potential for something to be misread in addition to ensuring a consistent editorial style,1
"As a copyeditor, I commit myself to a manuscript and enjoy the fine-tuning",1
"O.K., a monologue is memorized, which is different than maybe youve been assigned prose or poetry or extemporaneous speaking or manuscript speaking before.",0
"This is memorized which means you have no notes, you have no cue cards, you have no nothing.",1
All of it has to memorized.,1
"And it is imperative that it is memorized, you could do it in your sleep.",1
"You know, you dont even have to think about it.",1
"Because what happens when you go into performance or you go in and do this monologue in front of other people, that element of the person will totally throw you.",0
"And if the monologue is not memorized solidly, youll lose your place, youll be floundering for words.",1
"It is written that we should NOT be unequally yoked with unbelievers, NOR does light have ANY fellowship with darkness.",0
"IF we are to be children of God, we have to be separate from ungodly people.",0
"We cannot do as they do or share in their pleasures, we cannot be part with them whatsoever.",1
This is a VERY difficult message because even in your own family may be ungodly.,1
And even in your own family or your own friends or peers may be influencing you to be part of the world.,0
To come out and to be separate from these people may cost you all your relationship and your reputations.,0
I don�t know what you would have to do come out and be separate so that you could truly follow God as your Father.,1
"BUT what I DO know is IF YOU ASK FOR THE HOLY SPRIT, IF YOU PRAY AND SEEK OF THE LORD JESUS, HE WILL GUIDE YOU BY HIS HOLY SPIRIT AND HE WILL TEACH YOU WHAT YOU MUST DO.",0
"He is a teacher that is NOT like an earthly teacher, He doesn�t give earthly wisdom as men and women give wisdom.",0
"But He teaches in a way that leads us and guides us, He speaks directly to our spirit.",0
And if you want to be separate and truly a child of God you will accept the Holy Spirit.,0
You will pray and you will ask Jesus to give you the gift of the Holy Spirit.,1
And He will teach you and He will show you all things and show you even things that are to come.,0
"Were talking about evaluating a speech, and the next thing that we have to look at are the elements of presentation.",0
The first thing that you want to look at is in regards to the language.,1
"you are welcoming different points of view, different understandings, differing language",1
"So if I was to pick one of those, lets say",1
okay lets pick a whopper just for fun,1
The whole conception of what research actually is,1

"Hello Its Lorraine Tilbury again, Id like to develop a bit more the theme that Id like to present at the TEDx Tours event.",1
"in other words, non-predatory leadership as its practiced by horses and how that concept can be interesting to apply to the human environment.",1
"Its bit like horses whispering to people to evoke the film with the title the horse whisperer, in this case its the other way around... its inspired by the observation of many great leaders such as Winston Churchill, Buddha, Alexander the Great, George Washington, the 1st American president.... all these great leaders were also excellent horse riders, and often rode horses that only they were able to ride.",1

I really encourage you to come to the Finance and Sustainability Conference this year.,1
"There’s a lot of different ways that you can learn how not to just make it through these tough financial times, but really how we can thrive and learn from our peers together.",1
"If you want to form a non-profit corporation, the incorporation process is often similar to a for-profit corporation, but there are some important differences to be aware of.",1
"First, create a clear plan before incorporation.",1
"Understand what your non-profit organization will be, what societal need you’re addressing.",1
"The clearer, more developed your purpose, the easier the incorporation process will be.",1
You also need to figure out a fundraising plan.,1
"Think about who the typical donor will be for the organization, and what your plan is to solicit donations and develop a reliable source of donations.",1
"When it comes time to incorporate, most non-profit organizations incorporate in the state they operate in.",1
"First, you’ll need to choose a business name and check for availability.",1
"You must also file your Articles of Incorporation with the appropriate state office, usually the Secretary of State.",1
"A non-profit corporation, like any other corporation, should also create bylaws detailing the operation of the corporation.",1
"Specify how the business will be run, who makes the decisions, how decision-makers are selected, and other important issues.",1
For the Foundation we think about it in a number of different ways,1
"We think about how do we derisk, how do we work with private sector partners to derisk their interest and their capital allocation toward these markets",0
And we can use our investment tools to do that,1
"We can use, you know, whether it’s a guaranteed, a derisk, a market or whether it’s providing equity investments, you know, to go into a new opportunity",0
We can think about using our capital to derisk,1
The other thing that’s really important is getting people to talk to each other,1
"So, you know, the donor markets, the government markets are a big opportunity for companies",1
You know we’ve got companies like all of the big pharmaceutical companies providing vaccines and providing commodities and providing different types of products into these markets,0
"The last thing you want to do is take all of this information that you have learned about your audience, all of their environmental factors, you have hopefully learned about their attitudes, their beliefs, their values, and you want to turn that into something thats empathetic.",1
"Now what Im talking about is, as you pick your topic, as you write your speech, as you present your speech, I want you to put yourself in the position of the audience.",1
You know people will think you have gone MAD if you say you hear from JESUS.,0
The Christians will say youre hearing a voice in your head and its a demon.,0
"They say you have a more sure knowledge of God in the Bible, but if you hear from God in a vision or a dream or if HE speaks to you while you are praying, thats probably a demon.",1
They have NEVER heard from Jesus and they will discourage you from hearing from Jesus and they will despise prophecies.,0
"They test the Spirit of GOD against their own knowledge, but they accept the voice of demons as the voice of truth.",0
They discourage anyone from truly hearing from Jesus.,0
"It is VERY rare that you will hear someone actually encourage you to hear the voice of the Living God, to hear the Holy Spirit and to OBEY HIM!",0
"Most people that hear from God many NEVER EVER have anyone encourage them, because everyone around them is on the devils team, and discouraging anyone to actually hear from Jesus.",0
You know other Christians may encourage you to go to church.,1
And they certainly do encourage everyone to read the Bible.,0
But they do NOT encourage people to receive the Holy Spirit and to actually hear from Jesus.,1
Thats the science of immunizations,1
"Still, not everyone is convinced",0

Hi this is Jessica Smith and this is how a household budget works.,1
Many Americans do not have a household budget let alone know how one works so theyre wondering why at the end of the work they dont have money to spend or theyre wondering why they are going in debt.,0

Hello and welcome to Easy Food Dehydratings Video Newsletters!,1
Welcome to step 5 which is Conditioning Dehydrated Food ... by Susan Gast The conditioning of dehydrated food is a step often missed but not on purpose but out of the fact of not knowing about it!,1
"When we have dehydrated our fruits and vegetables, its time to let them cool down on the trays and then put them in some Ziploc™ bags - use the good bags - not sandwich bags and zip them closed!",1
Let the bags set out overnight on your kitchen counter top.,1
"If you live in an extremely warm climate like I do, please be on the safe side and put your bags in refrigerator overnight.",1
"The following day,  open your bags and feel for moisture.",0
On my website I tell you exactly what to expect for each food and to know when its appropriately dehydrated and when its too damp!,1
"If it is damp, please stick it back on the dehydrator and dehydrate until its properly dried.",1
The aim of the Ziploc™ bags is to help any remaining moisture distribute evenly among the bags contents.,1
Mushrooms are the most difficult vegetable to tell whether they are properly dried - bear in mind mushrooms are dehydrated at two different temperatures to begin with go check out the website about mushrooms.,0
Mushrooms need to be very dry before they are vacuum sealed and stored away.,1
"If a second go-around is deemed necessary on the dehydrator, dont forget to use the Ziploc™ bags again overnight and check them out again the day after.",1
Yes I know its a lot of work but I want you to make sure that your food is dried properly and I dont want you to run the risk of mold growth in your stored foods just because they were too damp!,1
Just a quick note here - yes I do re-use the Ziploc™ bags because theyre not cheap but I never re-use a Ziploc™ bag that has had meat in it.,1

"Social Anxiety Disorder is one of the group of anxiety disorders, and as the name implies, its used to identify individuals who have difficulty interacting with other people because of excessive anxiety.",0
Theyre overly concerned about being judged and they develop physical and psychological manifestations of their anxiety that are so extreme that they avoid social situations.,1
"And by social situations, I mean any situation that involves potential scrutiny by other people.",1
"Any situation where other people may judge them, but its less of a situation of being worried about the judgement and more of a situation of developing such intense physical and psychological feelings of anxiety that are so unpleasant, that as I said, these individuals avoid these situations.",1
"In terms of treatment, the most effective kinds of treatments is a combination of treatments.",0
The next principle we should talk about is automation.,1
"Whenever you write a piece of code to perform a task that otherwise you do by hand, that counts as automation.",0
There are a lot of steps of both development and operations processes that can be automated.,1
"One big one is deployment, setting up a server to run an application.",1
"Once upon a time, sysadmins would spend a lot of time setting up physical servers individually.",0
"And when you needed to install software upgrades, youd log into each machine and run the upgrade.",0
"Now smart operations people would automate as much of this as possible, like throw together a shell script that logs into each server and runs the upgrade.",1

Not every manufacturing businesses has state-of-the-art facilities and equipment,1
"Sometimes this causes the insurance company, through the risk-control process, to penalize your rate, weaken coverage, or force you to spend money on facility improvements",0
"So let me explain a few things about the risk control process, and then I’ll offer a key solution",1
"When you begin the policy period, someone from the insurance company, from the risk control department, comes out and does an inspection of your property",1
They’re looking for anything in your property that could increase the chance for a claim,1
"Maybe your fire extinguishers haven’t be tested in a few years, or the fire sprinkler system is older and increases the risk for a leak and subsequent water damage, or maybe your inventory is arranged in a way that increases the chance for fire to spread",1
Insurance companies can be very punitive in response to a poor risk-control visit,1
"penalizing your rate, weakening coverage, or forcing you to spend money to make improvements",1
So how do you deal with this situation? The best way to handle this problem is to never have a problem,1
"And by that, I mean - Be strategic in choosing your insurer, and opt for one that is more relaxed on risk-control standards",0
Someone in your office may have some expertise in this area,0
"If not, I’m a free resource",0
are really dying and its not good,0
"Well, since Im so dependent on my parents, I realize its hard for them to always, we live paycheck to paycheck so its hard to always make sure that were ok and stable",1
That influx in tuition either forces them [Students] to live with their parents or they have to get cheaper and cheaper housing in poorer neighborhoods and get two or three jobs so when you go to school youre tired and you dont want to learn,1
So it creates an environment of overall dissatisfaction,0

------Next up – Russia made some headlines in seafood sustainability this month: The World Wildlife Fund - and Fisheries Holding Karat have agreed to develop educational programs on sustainable fisheries.,1
The aim is to increase knowledge amongst fishing crew members and fishing companies of sustainable fisheries and the requirements for environmental certification according to the MSC.,1
"And, McDonalds is considering the launch of a Pollock processing factory in Russia.",1
The factory would produce filet-of-fish sandwiches out of Alaska Pollock sourced from MSC-Certified fisheries in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea.,1
This is contingent on the Russian fisheries obtaining the MSC eco-label.,1
"And in Germany, two supermarket chains have launched campaigns to promote sustainable seafood: Kaufland is supporting traditional tonguesole fishing in Gambia.",1
"For every kg of MSC certified fish sold during the 4 week campaign, 50 euro cents will be donated to the African fishery to help improve the situation of fishermen in Gambia who hope to be certified against the MSC standard.",0
"And, EDEKA supermarkets – is working with MSC on a campaign that features high impact point-of-sale materials to promote MSC products.",1

"And I was in the top three percent of the class, a member of the Texas Law Review, and constitutional law was one of my favorite classes",1
"In fact, I received an award for the top grade of the class",1
"I only mention this to say, I have more than a passing interest, and more than a passing knowledge, of constitutional law",1
"Now, Im an inactive member of the State Bar of Texas, so I havent been directly involved in legal research for many years",1
But Ive tried to keep up with this area of the law Because it is so important to us as Christians,1
So Id like to make a few comments,1

"BOB KUPBENS: We use a lot of different methods to gain consumer insight, I think.",1
Everything from highly numerical analytics that happens within each of our channels to external panels.,1
"And so we do panels, we do surveys, and we ask customers directly what do they like about our channels versus others, what do they see on our site versus competitors sites, and how is that going?",0
"We also, sometimes in a very humbling way, read customer verbatims every day.",1
"And so people have the ability to complain about all kinds of things, or give us props for some of our latest enhancements.",1
"And I think thats really exciting, because you feel like youre really getting the voice of the customer.",1
"Were doing that again across social channels, were doing that on the web.",1
"Although nearly 24 million workers are classified as unemployed or underemployed, employers are having difficulty finding skilled employees.",0

"I want thank Venezuela that Mr. Tim Tracy has been released as of this morning and returned to the United States, and that is a very positive development.",1
I also want to thank for them for the selection and the appointment of Ambassador Ortega to come to Washington to serve as the charge daffaires.,1
"And we agreed today, both of us, Venezuela and the United States, that we would like to see our countries find a new way forward, establish a more constructive and positive relationship, and find the ways to do that.",1
"DARREN HUSTON: Yeah, 2010, I mean there is so much change going on but just at the highest level.",1
"I think, obviously, theres a ton of innovation going on in the search space, both Google and us spending a ton of energy innovating in search.",1
"And I think thats going to be great, ultimately, for our end users.",1
So youre going to see a lot more coming in the search space almost every week.,1
"And then in the space of behavioral targeting, its getting more and more precise to a point now where we do custom targeting for specific brands, really figuring out who exactly is their consumer and then going out to find millions of people like that through the advent of just very advanced custom behavioral targeting.",1
"And then in the brands space, some great stuff, HD video, rich media is hot.",1
"By policy, youre not allowed to share your Dalhousie password.",0
"That includes with your significant others, or your children, or even your boss.",0
"Some well-meaning bosses have thought, Well I need to keep all these passwords on file, just in case.  Thats not correct.",1
"If you need to share, lets say, a folder of email, one particular folder with your boss, there are ways of technically setting that up so you can both access it with your own NetID and password.",1
but now I think we can still stand proud and say that ours head and shoulders above anyone else in the world,1
And youll all going to study at some of them,1
And its a great shame obviously for me that none of you are going to Oxford but Ill get over that,1
I wish you all the best in your studies,1

"They make me feel worse, and life becomes even more unappealing.",0
"Im forced to stand alone as I fight this ongoing war, because my mental health is damaged, and Im the one in four.",0
"Just like Hitler and his Aryan race, you make me feel ashamed and you make me feel disgraced for existing.",0
"For being something, that I did not choose to be, for having something, a label, that I want to be set free.",0
I felt out of place before I could turn these experiences into funny stories,0

"DAVID EAST: Whats up, everybody? David, here",1
And I work on the Firebase team,1
And two interesting facts about me,1
"One, I was born in a country that no longer exists",1
"And two, I always use const and let over var, because, you know, thats just what you do now",1
"Today, I have some excellent news for you",1
"Im here to announce a brand new series called, Ask Firebase",1
And what is Ask Firebase? Im glad you asked,1
"So Ask Firebase is for any type of developer, whether you are a Android developer, iOS developer, a web developer, or a Fortran developer-- do we support Fortran? No",1
"If you are an advanced, intermediate, or beginner, it doesnt really matter",1
"If you ask us a question, were going to answer it on this show",1
Lets get into some of your questions,1
"Fantompower asks, where can we send our Ask Firebase questions? Well, you can use the #AskFirebase, and you can send it into Twitter, Google Plus, or even down here in the comments on YouTube",1
"And puf asks, how many questions will you answer every week? Well, thats a good question, puf",1
And that solely depends on how many questions you all send us,1
"So if send us a bunch of questions, were going to do whatever we can to answer each and every one of those, or just how many we can get to that week",1
So lets check out another question,1
"Tamplin asks, where can I find new episodes of #AskFirebase? Well, you can go to youtube",1
"com/firebase and subscribe to that YouTube channel, which is, you know, this right here",1
"And were going to be airing them every single week, Wednesday at noon",1
"Hey, we should answer another question",1
"Gabe asked, is your refrigerator running? Oh, well, jokes on you, Gabe",1
"I live off the grid, so I dont even use any electricity",1

"Be sure to get your questions in, using the #AskFirebase on any social media of your choosing, as long as you use the hashtag Ask Firebase",1
"If youre on Twitter, you can just say hashtag Ask Firebase",1
"Or if youre on G Plus, you can also use hashtag Ask Firebase",1
"So if youre looking to get started with Firebase, you should check out Firecasts, which are screencasts that cover each and every platform the Firebase supports, so Android, iOS, and Web",1
"And if you are really thirsty for knowledge, you should check out the Firebase documentation, which covers everything that you need to know about Firebase",1
And you can find links to all that content right down here in the YouTube description,1
Hi so you are a homeowner and you are wondering how to calculate the equity or if you have any equity in your property.,1
"No problem, Ill be able to answer that.",1
"Some of the different ways we’re starting to listen to our customers, you know, in the past it might have been more formal research, focus groups, things.",1
We can use interactive in digital means now to go out and even more informally ping our customers with questions.,1
"They can self select, raise their hand and say, “I’d like to be a part of, you know, a community of interest or a user group.",1
"And maybe I’m not as willing to go fly in and be in a huge, you know, two day conference for the user group, but interactively, you know, just bring me into a net meeting,” or these sorts of things.",1
"And I think there’s many, many low cost ways now, many more than there ever were available to get that voice of customer to the organization.",1
"And so we’re experimenting with either, you know, around how-- you know, okay, we have user groups.",1
"James: Hi YouTube, I viewed your video and I think I understand your concerns in respect to the affect of knowledge based regulation of markets.",1

"Every tournament will pick a different province type, for example the Elixier Tournament”",1
"The more provinces of this type you have completed, the more tournament provinces will be available for you",1
"First, you have to start with the closest province to your hometown",1
"If you enter it, you will see a new kind of encounters",1
"You can still fight or negotiate, but the rules for fighting have slightly changed to ensure a steady challenge for you",1
"If you finish the whole province, you will unlock a higher difficulty level and also expand the tournament to another, more distant province",1
"So, the difficulty rises not only with the distance of the province, but also with its level",1
"And of course, higher difficulty means more and better rewards",1
We also implemented an exciting new multiplayer feature,1
"Every province also collects its own points, whenever any player completes an encounter there",1
so we dont want to send five emails in one day,1
I have done that before its not good,0
so what happens when we spam our people is that we just become white noise and they block us out or they send us to their spam folder,0
and number four: dont use insider language,0
a lot of times in the church we say things that people outside of the church dont understand and ultimately our goal is to communicate with other people who dont go to our church,1
in our church we tend to talk as if were talking to church members,1
"so, for example, in the Methodist Church we say things like: acolytes, narthex, communion",1
we have all of these different terms that people may not understand if they are new to the church,1
"they may come from other traditions, faith traditions",1
A new report from KPMG found that medium sized businesses in North America intend to grow their presence overseas in the coming months.,1
"IF you claim to follow Jesus as your God, then I have a question for you: Are you worthy to be counted as a witness for Jesus?",1
Are you worthy to be called a witness?,0
A witness is someone who has seen something.,0
"NO judge and NO court would call you to testify about something you never saw, and you would have to have seen that thing first hand.",1
"So if you’re going to be a worthy witness for Jesus, you have to have truly met Jesus.",0
"If you have only hear about Jesus in the Bible, if you have only read about Him in books, if you have only heard about Him from other people, then that is NOT worthy of being called a witness.",0
A WITNESS HAS TRULY MET JESUS!,0

"RENANA PERES: Indeed, word of mouth has a double role.",1

"Hi! I’m Smo, and today I’m guest vlogging for EF",1
"I wanted to do this when it was still light outside, but hey, Finland in the winter time…",1
I love traveling and seeing new places,0
"I haven’t done it too much though because my dad would never let me, thinking I would do something totally irresponsible and reckless, and I was like: Me? Never! However, I did visit China recently",1
"I went to Beijing and quickly realized that you do, indeed, have to learn some of the local Chinese to get around",1
I would be speaking English to the taxi drivers and the hotel staff while they would reply in Chinese,1
"So, basically, no one understood anyone",0
I also had to learn English when I went to the States,0
"Who would have thought? They don’t speak Finnish there? And I’m sad to admit that I’ve never been to central Europe, which is sad, if you don’t count stopping by the airport in Amsterdam, which was already too much for me",1
I’m a super eager learner … when it comes to languages,0
I hate math and physics … and chemistry,1
I also have a Persian friend who teaches me a lot of bad stuff in Farsi because I totally need all the bad words,0
"I also have a whole bunch of other friends who teach me some español, Deutsch, français … I also know a lot of random stuff in other languages",0
"It just fascinates me immensely! If you meet me, the first thing I’ll probably ask you is about your ethnicity and the languages you speak because I am a language freak! Whenever I have the chance, I do take off to somewhere I haven’t been before",1
I’d hate having to leave this world having not visited every continent! Great,0
Several years ago I was invited by the mathematics department of a local university to speak on the topic of presentation.,1
"The seminar was to be given on a Friday evening, and I finished preparing my content the Sunday before, so I had five days to rehearse.",1
Every day I made time to run through the material trying to absorb it and really make it a part of me.,1
On Wednesday morning something happened that taught me a lesson I’ll never forget.,1
"It was a beautiful, sunny day and I was walking down Elmer Street on my way to an appointment.",1
While I walked I was using the time to run through the presentation in my head.,1
Naturally I didnt want passing drivers to think I was talking to myself.,1
In the midst of rehearsing I suddenly realized the entire middle section of my speech was redundant and needed to be cut.,1
This wasn’t some minor tweak.,1
This called for a major re-write.,1
"Fortunately, I had the time to make the revisions and incorporate the changes into my practice.",1
"Friday evening rolled around, I gave the seminar, and it was well received.",1
I often wonder what would have happened had I not allowed for that amount of time to rehearse.,1
Let’s just say that I had waited until Thursday night to write the presentation.,1
This next clip is on how to hire staff for your event.,0

"This is financial advisor, Patrick Munro, talking about what is the formula for an annuity.",1
"Many people dont understand how annuities work, so let me put it simply to you.",1
"You learn a little bit about culture, When you live in with people, Who have been living around the world.",1
"For example my friend from Burundi: Jeen, The other day, Came up to me to say, “My name’s Jean, si vous plait!” It seems Jeen means Demon, In his local language, So you can see him steaming, When I can’t even manage, To distinguish between spiritual warfare, And a particular type of trousers.",1
"And then I know a Canadian, a Latin American, and a German, Who is one person.",1
"He claims ancestral roots, From all aboot the western world, And yet finds time to rest his mind in Myanmar.",1

"And I know a girl, She’s Thai, She brought herself over here, But then God took over her.",1
"She was doing her Masters in my first year, But somehow found time to give me time, making life less of a blur.",1
So the first observation I would have is that something important is happening in markets all around the world.,1
"We believe that the MFS, Mobile Financial Services, can really help on bank access financial services entering into the formal economy and we believe that the Telcos have real advantages to provide.",1
"Today this is early stage, we dont have the solutions in place but we already see that its something shaping up to be very important.",1
"The impact of Mobile Financial Services can be measured both as social impacts and as economic impacts and it really has a macro side which is important to countries and individuals, in particular in emerging countries.",1
"So we see economic growth, we see the creation of jobs, employment, and so forth but we also see social benefits such as the reduction of inequality, access to the formal economy, and the increased resilience and efficiency.",0
A bottom-up approach to getting this right is important.,1
My name is Julie Asti.,1
"Im a certified financial planner with Asti Financial Management and, today, Im going to talk about how to create an investment portfolio.",1
"If youre looking to create an investment portfolio, there are a few things that you should initially consider.",0
"The stereotype is that Cconservatives understand how economic liberty works and don’t care as much for civil liberties, and that the Lliberals care about civil liberties but don’t really care much about economic freedom or know really how free market economies are supposed to work.",0
The truth is there’s no real distinction between civil liberties and economic liberties.,1
"They’re one and the same, and it’s a mistake to try to separate them out and defend one at the expense of the other.",0
What does it mean to have freedom of choice or freedom of conscience if I don’t have the physical freedom to make a transaction that brings that choice into reality?,0
"For example, let’s say that you have a publishing company.",0
You want the freedom to be able to publish what you want.,1
But Wwhat does it mean to say that you have the freedom to publish what you want if there’s are restrictions on what sorts of printed material can be bought and sold?,0
Your right to read is tied to other people’s right to publish.,0
You don’t have the right to seek information if the information isn’t allowed to come into existence in the first place.,1
"By the same token, if I have the right to publish anything I want, but some of the ideas I publish are punishable by death, then I really don’t have a substantial right to publish whatever I want.",1
"So this is an example of how economic liberty, if we think of it from the point of view of buying and selling printed matter, is connected very intimately to your individual liberty of conscience in choosing what to read, what to think, what to believe.",0
Here’s another example.,0
"Now, the next type of voice-over work that you might do, is what were going to call, industrial voice-over.",1
"And industrial voice-over, are things like training films, educational films, corporate videos, where people are teaching something, and perhaps there are components on the film, where they have someone voice over the voice.",1
"Maybe were showing how to build something, and someone is demonstrating how to build it, but theyre not the ones that are talking about it.",1
"Hello, I am Julian Leutgeb and by working with Junge Marke I want to make the world more suitable for young people",1
"Because that is the change that I want to create in this world and I think out of my experience, that this includes responsibilities and tasks that I am good at and I like doing",1
"And also because I realised during the last weeks, that this challenge is truly inspiring me",1
"During the last 8 years at Partycipation, I led teams of up to 25 young adults, which performed great at their honorary work And I am confident and Ill be happy to do so for the „Junge Marke“ as well",1
"I dont know if I waited for this challenge or it waited for me, but it seems kind of like it was made for me",1
"and strength to remove yourself and do the smarter, safer thing",1
Especially when what you really want to do is fight back,0
But one of the biggest reasons students don’t tell an adult is because they don’t want to be called a snitch,1
this is because many people don’t know the difference between snitching and reporting,1
"The Adult Health CNS Exam, or the Adult Health Clinical Nurse Specialist Exam, is an exam to qualify nurses who wish to take part of the advanced care of seriously ill adult patients.",1
"In this exam, you will be given 175 multiple choice questions, which includes 25, unscored, pretest questions.",1
"These questions will test your knowledge in Nursing Science, Organization/Network/Health Systems, Basic and Applied Science, Researce, Education, and Professional Attitudes.",1
Thanks for joining me,1
This is my third video in the Basic Accounting Principles series for Lewis &amp; Clark Community College,1
"This conversation is, basically, about the definition of the assets of the company",1
I want to take a deep dive in what those assets might be,1
"First off, first and foremost, is the purpose of any business is of course to make money, and ultimately, profit",1
"And, we generally characterized profit, ultimately, with having a cash position",1
So cash is the first asset really care about,1
"We always hear the saying, cash is king",1
So thats the one we talk about first,1
"But, we also have times where, for example, we may not require customers to pay us right away",1
"So, we have these things called accounts receivable",1
"Now, accounts receivable fits into this nifty little category called cash equivalents",1
"So, we can turn it into cash very quickly",1
"We expect within 30 days, ninety days maybe, that those items are going to be turned into cash",1
"So, we have accounts receivable",1
"Thats, again, the money that our customers owe us still",1
We also have things call pre-paid accounts,1
"Pre-paid accounts are, basically, where we pay things in advance",1
"So, think if you were to pay, for example, your rent",1
And you paid the whole years rent in advance at the beginning of the year,1
"Obviously, youre not using it until you get all the way through the year",1
"And, so, each month youre using 1/12 of that balance",1
"But,essentially, you might you might pay that item in advance, in which case you have whats called a pre-paid",0
"Theres all kinds of different pre-paids, but thats one of the more basic examples we talk about",1
We also have more physical type assets; like inventory,1
"Inventory, specifically, we talk specifically about inventories themselves, were generally talking about merchandise that we either are making or, at least, holding for the purpose selling",1
"It is, actually, part of our core business",1
There are also sub-categories of inventory,1
"For example, supply inventories and things like that almost always are general referred to as, just simply, supplies",1
"Now, thats also things that were going to use up in our organization",1
"But, theyre just sitting in the supply closet, or wherever it is we keep those",0
Theyre not really something that we turn around and sell but it is things that we have available to us,0
We also have things that are called fixed assets,1
"Now, fixed assets are like hard physical access so like your computer, or your desks, your office furniture, the building itself, any heavy equipment that we might have",1
Even vehicles would fit in Fixed Asset categories,1
"Those fixed assets, as a general rule, depreciate over time",1
"That is, they become less and less valuable",1
So we have to do a thing called depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation,1
"Accumulated depreciation, by the way, is a contra asset, which we will cover in another video",1
The other thing that we have is Intangibles,1
"Intangibles, by definition, are things that we cant touch",0
"So, they have no actual physical presence",1
If we have a pattent theres a certificate or something like that represent the patent,1
But the pattent itself the idea cant be touched,1
"Same way for a copyright or a franchise agreement, or whatever like that",1
Even though there may be paper that represent the contract involved,1
"Those ideas, those conceps, themselves are intagible",1
"Usually, those have finite lives",1
"For example, patents last 20 years",1
"So, we would take that cost, or whatever it was to acquire that patent",1
form of a Pixar movie,1
And that structure lends itself beautifully to entrepreneurial activities,1
You say once upon a time everybody did something a certain way,1
"Every day they led a life, there were things that didnt work very, very well",1
One day we came along with a way to solve their problem,0
"Because of that, their lives improved",1
"Because of that, something else improved",0
"Until finally people realized that the way to solve their problems, the way to lead a better life is to buy our product",1
Its so unbelievably simple and its so much at our fingertips,1
"So I encourage, you know, watch a Pixar movie, look at this Pixar pitch and give it a try yourself",1
Heres another interesting way to pitch built on the evidence,1
It turns out that pitches that rhyme are often more effective than pitches that dont,1
"Now this seems peculiar, but theres great research out of Lafayette College",1
"According to Graham Pickett, head of travel, hospitality and leisure at Deloitte, social media and review sites have an increasingly powerful role in the holiday destination decision-making process with 86% of overseas and 91% of domestic travel transactions now digitally influenced.",1
"Speaking at the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) Travel Matters Conference in London recently, he noted, a 60% increase in last minute hotel queries year-on-year in 20112 has dramatically shortened the booking window.",1
"and the casual worlds, if you want to play in a more relaxed environment",1
"Our latest changes, that some of you might have already experienced is our brand new Paladin System",1
"So, this is the overview of the changes we made in the game",1
Were still actively working on Tribal Wars and we want to make sure that you have new challenges to face,1
We might even have a new building coming up soon,1
We hope that youre going to enjoy the activities weve planned for the birthday,1
See you soon in the game,1
"Thankfully for you guys, were not the only ones making videos",1
Actually some of you guys took part in The Wests video contest last month,1
And we thank you guys SO much for that,1
"Our prime concern is that in dealing with the fundamental law of the land, in assuming finally to interpret it, and therefore finally to make it, the acts of the courts should be subject to  and not above the final control of the people as a whole.",1
"I deny that the American people have surrendered to any set of men, no matter what their position or their character, the final right to determine those fundamental questions upon which free self-government ultimately depends.",1
"The people themselves must be the ultimate makers of their own Constitution, and where their agents differ  in their interpretations of the Constitution the people themselves should be given the chance, after full and deliberate judgment, authoritatively to settle what interpretation it is that their representatives shall thereafter adopt as binding.",1
We do not question the general honesty of the courts.,1
"But in applying to present-day social conditions the general prohibitions that were intended originally as safeguards to the citizen against the arbitrary power of government in the hands of caste and privilege, these prohibitions have been turned by the courts from safeguards against political and social privilege into barriers against political and social justice and advancement.",0
"Our purpose is not to impugn the courts, but to emancipate them from a position where they stand in the way of social justice.",1
"And to emancipate the people, in an orderly way, from the iniquity of enforced submission to a doctrine which would turn constitutional provisions which were intended  to favor social justice and advancement into prohibitions against such justice and advancement.",1
"In the last twenty years an increasing percentage of our people have come to depend on industry for their livelihood, so that today the wage-workers in industry rank in importance side by side with the tillers of the soil.",1
As a people we cannot afford to let any group of citizens or any individual citizen live or labor under conditions which are injurious to the common welfare.,1
"Industry, therefore, must submit to such public regulation as will make it a means of life and health, not of death or inefficiency.",1
We must protect the crushable elements at the base of our present industrial structure.,1
We stand for a living wage.,1
Wages are subnormal if they fail to provide a living for those who devote their time and energy to industrial occupations.,1
"The monetary equivalent of a living wage varies according to local conditions, but must include enough to secure the elements of a normal standard of living, a standard high enough to make morality possible, to provide for education and recreation, to care for immature members of the family, to maintain the family during periods of sickness, and to permit a reasonable saving for old age.",1
A newer type of security technology that weve seen over the last few years is something called a web application firewall.,1
Youll hear this referred to as a WAF.,1
"A web application firewall is looking at web conversations, and its trying to determine based on that web conversation if the information within your packets, within that conversation, is legitimate.",1
Youll often see this used to make sure that when people are inputting information into a web form that that information is correct.,1
"If youre trying to put in a serial number, or the date, or a ZIP code, this particular web application firewall technology is looking to see, is that really is zip code youre adding in there?",1
Is that really a serial number?,1
"The reason thats important is that if you try to put unexpected information into one of these fields and youre able to manipulate the application, you can often find exploits that might give you direct access to the database thats contained behind it, or direct access to the web server on which this particular application is running.",1
"So by having this additional check of that input data, youre hopefully protecting against things like database injections and things like buffer overflows.",0
"Alright the last type of eulogy style that you might want to choose from is called a theme, and there can be any kind of theme imaginable for a persons eulogy.",1
"Hello, this weeks lecture is given by Zack Moir and Nikki Moran.",1
You met Zack last week.,1
- [Narrator] So be sure to ask your early childhood educator about this,1
"If you have any further questions, you could also contact ACEQA, who oversee the implementation of the National Quality Framework",1
Its important to consider your expectations,1
"Educators were being asked by parents to do things that were unsafe for their child, not in their childs best interest, and possibly in contrevention of the Education and Care Services National Law, putting educators in an incredibly difficult position",1
"- [Karen] Ultimately, our research on sleep, rest, and relaxation has shown that its vital for childrens development and ongoing wellbeing",1
"It helps young bodies to recuperate, and is important for their lifelong brain development and wellbeing",1
"Okay, the first thing I want to talk about with regards to delivering a eulogy, before I even talk about style and structure, is two things.",1
"Most likely, you will know the person that you are eulogizing, and everything that comes after this clip will be tailored as if you know the person.",1
A company doesnt have to give you a reason for not promoting you or when they fire you.,0
"In certain circumstances, you may be entitled to file a claim if you feel you were wrongfully terminated or did not receive a promotion because of your protected class.",0
I recommend you seek an attorney or advice from an employment lawyer if you feel you were discriminated against.,0
"This letter is from Mary Louise and she writes, Thank you for upholding Christian, family values in your family and in your business world.",1
"You are a courageous example of faith, hope, and charity. Our Christian faith has always been the cornerstone by which we have operated our company.",1
There are two virtues that you will find promoted pretty much anywhere you look.,0
The first is conviction.,0
You take a stand for what you believe in against all odds.,1
"We love to hear stories about people who confronted the oppression of tyrants, who stared down the masses, who stood their ground against all opposition and humilation and persecution, and in the end they won!",1
We love to hear those stories.,1
"And yet, we are also told that we need to maintain an open mind, which is the second virtue.",1
"But the irony is the moment you demonstrate conviction, someone will inevitably accuse you of being close-minded.",1
So how does that work?,1
"How is it that both conviction and having an open mind are virtues, and yet in practice, they are at opposite ends of a spectrum?",1
It is one or the other.,1
There is a misconception about what it means to have an open or closed mind.,1
"This is financial adviser, Patrick Munro, talking about the complex world of IRAs.",1

Afterwards I will share my personal experience how you can reduce your chances of failure in Oracle 1Z0-525 exam which is related to “Oracle Business Intelligence (OBI) Applications 7 for ERP Essentials” and credits towards “Oracle Business Intelligence Applications 7 for ERP Certified Implementation Specialist” Certification.,1
"Let’s get started This exam validates the ability to Define and describe business analytics and business intelligence, Identify the major components of the Oracle BI Applications architecture, Explain the relationships among Oracle Business Intelligence Applications components, Configure Informatica PowerCenter for Oracle Business Intelligence Applications.",1

"Im Mike Campbell with Doggie Styles, Beverly Hills, California.",1
"And, Id like to talk about selling homemade crafts.",1
We do have some items here in the store that are homemade.,1
"We have some vendors, who, a woman who sits down at her kitchen tables and sews a little dress by hand, that we sell to our customers.",1
A lot of people are really looking for that homemade touch.,1
"I also find a lot of our tourists traffic, a lot of our customers from Japan, in particular, really like homemade items.",1
They really go crazy for that.,1
"They say, Why would I ever say I accept something that I want to get rid of",0
"Well, its our inability to accept a feeling that usually keeps it stuck in place",1
"By saying the setup statement, it sets us up for the rest of the process, helps neutralize any judgement we have around the problem",1
So you say the setup statement three times,0
Then you tap on the rest of the acupressure points,1
while simply saying how you feel,1
Its not about the fancy language,1
"its about being honest with how youre feeling, bringing that up in your body, and tapping on these acupressure points",1
"Again, sending that calming signal to the brain",1
"letting your brain know that even with this thought, you are safe and its Ok to relax",1
So let me give you an example of what one tapping round may look like,1
"If you are stressed, around say a deadline",1

Hello everybody.,1
Im John Anderson and Im your instructor for this online Sociology 1 (or Introductory Sociology) class.,1
"I look forward to getting to know you all over the next 8 weeks as we explore the field of Sociology with such topics as gender, sexuality, religion, deviance, race, education and much more.",1
I wanted to create this welcome video mainly so that you all can actually know who I am.,1
I know that taking online classes can sometimes make students feel as if the teacher only exists through the internet.,1
"While all of our contact will be through Canvas, I just wanted you all to know that I am real and I will be the instructor you are working with.",1
So this is my official hello.,1
You can find out a little more about me on the page titled Meet Your Instructor. I want to maintain very good communication with you all so please do not ever hesitate to talk to me.,0
I want to be as approachable as possible.,0
You will find my contact information and preferences in both the welcome letter and the course syllabus.,1
"But just to reiterate, any private contact or emails from you to me should be sent via the Inbox link at the top right corner of Canvas.",1
"For quicker responses, feel free to text my Google Voice number which bounces to my cell phone.",1
"I can typically respond much quicker to this method, although please only expect responses during reasonable hours.",0
"The content for this class including discussion posts, projects, informal quizzes, and various online activities will be conducted through Canvas modules, which are basically just structured, organized pages that must be done in sequence.",1
This means that you cannot skip ahead to material or content that has not been viewed or completed.,1
I dont do this to make your life miserable -- I promise.,1
"Alright, now lets talk about, in relation to content, adaptation of material.",1
Lets talk about living an integrated life.,1
Its a concept Bill George brings out in his book True North.,1
"I use this tool among others when I work with the LeaderSync Group, my organization as we coach and help develop leaders, leadership teams and groups.",1
One of the sections in there is this idea of bringing all the components of your life together and holistic functioning way.,1
"George says, Dont get this confused with balance thats this is not a code word for balance, balance I believe is a myth that a misnomer. But it is about focus an integration of the key areas like relationships, work-life, personal growth as a leader, leadership challenges, skill development etc.",1
"So George focuses on that, we do as we work with and coach leaders.",1
"He quotes John Donahoe who is the CEO of Ebay seceded May, Meg Whitman.",1
"Donahoe says, The struggle is constant as the trade-offs and choices dont get any easier as you get older.",1
George says living an integrated life is a challenging thing to do and allows you to live a life that when the highs are high you dont get cocky and when you hit the low moments now you dont get depressed and go into despair because your integrating a number of components together so you have more of a whole life as a leader.,1
"I focus on three areas when I do my leadership development work; story, soul and strategy.",1
"Story is mining things like youre defining moments as a leader, youre driving values, some of the primary strenths that you have that got you where you are.",1
"Lets mine those, lets find out where they came from, you know, how they work, how they contribute to your leadership growth so we work a bit in story.",1
The last zone that is still used in play is called the phased-out zone.,1
The phased-out zone is a special place in the game where you put creatures or other permanents that have the ability phasing.,1
Anything that has phasing that is in play currently is put into the POZ at the beginning of your turn.,1
"In fact, before you untap, thats the only thing that can happen before your untapped step.",1
Theres lots of goods and bads about being a financial adviser.,1

"Hi, Im Casey Cole.",1
Im the managing director of Guru Systems.,1

It seemed this creature was riding the Lion,1
"Zecora slowly let her mind reel back to her tribes temple, a Lion and a Snake-Like Creature riding it",1
Is this really the Zebras God Cord,1
"Zecora stood in silent and awe, hereyes widened as the mysterious creature grabbed a rope and tided it around the Lions neak, the Lion growled but its old shaky legs gave in",0
"The Lion collapsed, letting out soft moans of I yield",1
Hi I am Kathleen Jaben Welcome to Textile Science.,1
"If the word science in the title of this course made you nervous, it is a science.",1
but it is a science you will really be glad you got involved with.,1
"If you chose your major because you want to be involved in the fashion or apparel industry then you have to ask yourself, how can I be in this industry without knowing about fabric? This is where I agree with you.",1
I love fabric I have always loved fabric for as long as I can remember.,1
Think of me as the person you see walking through a store with one arm outstretched touching and feeling all of the apparel.,1
I am also the person who might go into a fabric store and buy a piece of fabric and without even knowing what I plan to use it for.,1
I just wanted it.,1
Fabric is the paint and the paint brush of the industry.,1
Textile science is the foundation knowledge of all fabrics.,1
This class is challenging but it is also very engaging.,1
You will leave it knowing a lot more about fabric and hopefully you will love fabric.,1
So I am looking forward to working with you and increasing your knowledge about fabric.,1
The first thing I would like you to do is to introduce yourself to me and other classmates by joining the discussion forum.,1
"What I would like you to do is find a garment, take a look at the label in the garment, I have a garment which is a white jacket that I wear often.",1
The label reads 98% cotton and 2 % spandex .I have given a few questions to answer.,1
The first question is: Is this garment comfortable to wear?,1
My garment for example is very comfortable particularly in California where we dont need anything very heavy to cover and keep my body temperature comfortable and the way I like it.,1
"point in this process, in that stage there Im going to turn the slide",1
"KIMBERLY STEVENS, NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE: I always was very withdrawn.",0
I was sexually molested at about the age of 3 and I became very withdrawn.,0
I was molested by my uncle and my cousin.,1
I just really grew close to my father and my grandfather.,1
"But, as I got older, my mother and father got divorced, my grandfather died, and my life just kind of spiraled.",0
"I started going out and I liked boys, but I didnt like boys.",1
"I guess the trauma... You know, I always liked being around boys, but I didnt want them to touch me.",1
So I started drinking and then along came the drugs.,0
Ill say I kind of tampered with that for quite a few years.,0
"I started in high school with drugs, kind of frequently.",1
"Then, after that, it became an every-day thing.",1
Id say by the age of 28 I was a full-blown addict.,1
I resorted to selling drugs to support my habit.,0
"So then I started going to jail, back and forth to jail.",1
So it was a vicious cycle.,0
"I went to jail, sold drugs, went to jail, sold drugs.",1
"Plus I got really emotionally invested in the characters and this is coming from someone who doesnt often read historical books, so if you, like me, dont frequently read historical, I would still recommend it because its just a fantastic book",1
"All right, now lets talk about focusing audience attention.",1
"Many new entrepreneurs think life is like it looks on TV, on Shark Tank or Dragons Den.",1
"You go, you pitch the investor, they like what youre doing they say yes and they give you a check.",1
"Actually, even on Shark Tank between the moment when the check is offered and the check is actually received is a process called due diligence where the investor brings in their outside experts to verify all of the information in your company.",1
"Hi, my name is Mike Hineberg and Im an Independent Living Skill Coordinator at IndependenceFirst where Ive worked for fifteen years.",1
The most unique thing about my job at IndependenceFirst is that I work in an environment where over half the people are individuals with disabilities.,1
"For me, as a person with a disability, thats a very unique feature because finally I am at a workplace where I dont have to either hide my disability or make excuses or educate my co-workers for what they should or should not do for me.",1
I have a strong thrive to help people with disabilities achieve maximum  independence.,1
"I do that by teaching them independent life skills  such as how to manage a checking account, time management, money management, self esteem, service skills, bus skills, jobs seeking skills, essentially what every person needs in order to be more independent in thier life.",1
"I do all that in the context  of empowerment, independent decision making, we do not, uh... we do not do case management.",1
Life skills will power the individuals to make as many decisions for themselves as they can.,1

"Hi everyone, BJ Smith from The Busy Marketer coming to you from my podcast studio with another edition of Digital Marketing News for The Busy Marketer ... #TBMnews ... The latest information on Digital Marketing that you need to know right now.",1
Our story today comes from Facebook.,1
"Yesterday Facebook announced more video updates, this time taking some plays out of YouTubes book.",0
"The first update, which will be rolling out this week, is the addition of a view count on videos.",1
"So, down at the bottom of every video youll see a number of likes, number of comments, and number of views.",1
"According to Facebook, “views will be shown on public videos from people and pages, to help people discover new, popular videos.” The first thing that popped in my mind when I read this was, how is this going to affect small businesses and small organizations that dont have a large following?",1
"Will people be less likely to view a video with a dozen views when theyre used to seeing viral videos, or even videos from large organizations with thousands of views?",1
"I was a little turned off with the statement, “to help people DISCOVER new, popular videos.” In the same press release Facebook talks about how video ranking in News Feed was improved a few months ago to show people more relevant and interesting videos.",1
So how exactly does showing the number of views help since they already have an algorithm in place to get appropriate videos in front of people?,1
And what exactly counts as a view?,1
When a video appears in most peoples News Feed it auto-plays.,1
"If an auto-play counts as a view, then organizations with hundreds of thousands of followers are going to naturally show a high number of views because its showing up in the News Feed of many of their followers.",1
"One of the things I love about social media is, at least in the beginning, it leveled the playing field.",1
Small organizations could run grassroots marketing and had a chance against the large corporations.,1
"A $100,000 businesses could be shown in the same feed with the Wal-Marts of the world.",1
"It seems with every update to Facebook, the balance swings more and more in favor of the companies with the biggest budgets.",1
The cynic in me has to question whether this is a play to get more Pages to buy advertising to get their video views up.,1
Is it just me?,0

This is a quick summary and analysis of The Road by Cormac McCarthy.,1
This is a story about a man and his son who are travelling along a road in the aftermath of a disaster that has destroyed most of the world.,1
"The man is harboring a bad cough, but tries to make the best of it since he’s all his son has left.",1
"They travel light, carrying just what they need to survive, and are extremely cautious of the few people that they do come across.",1
Supplies are limited since most of civilization has been destroyed.,1
"They carry a map and are heading towards the coast, hoping for better weather.",0
"During their journey, they encounter various individuals, including an armed group of militia, a lonely little boy, a basement full of prisoners to be eaten, and a blind old man.",1
"Along their journey, they find supplies of food and blankets, but the man insists that they keep moving.",1
They eventually get to the coast and the man sees a distant boat off the shore.,1
"He swims to the boat and discovers that it’s abandoned and contains useful supplies, like a flare gun.",1
"After raiding the boat of all of its supplies, the man and boy continue moving on.",1
"However, someone takes their cart and supplies, so they go after the thief.",0
"After retrieving their supplies and cart, they enter a quiet town, but are suddenly attacked by a man with a bow and arrow.",1
The man is wounded by an arrow and his son can only watch as he tries to bandage his wound.,1
The man is dying and tells his son that he must continue travelling on the road.,1

UK Businesses gearing up for more mergers and acquisitions Evidence that UK businesses are gearing themselves up for more mergers and acquisitions is backed up by two surveys from the countrys top accountancy firms.,0
Ernst and Young said 42 percent of businesses surveyed were putting capital aside for takeover activity rather than paying down debts.,1

"If you are an entrepreneur, youre a small business person, you have a lot of hassles and a lot of expense dealing with all the human resources stuff.",1
is what happens when we also have vertex capacities,1
These correspond to the amount of processing power that each middlebox in the network may or may not have,1
"And finally, our goal is to find a way to simultaneously route and process as much of the flow as possible",1
"Meaning that between each SI and TI, we want to send a flow that satisfies all of the edge capacities",1
"But at the same time, this flow can allocate one unit of processing to one of the vertices that it goes through",1
"And we dont want to exceed any of these vertex processing constraints, either",0
And were going to assume that each unit of flow really corresponds to one unit of processing,1
So this is really a two part problem,1
There is both the routing part and the steering part,1
"So in the routing part, were going to try getting flow from the sources to the sinks",1
"Hello, my name is David Scher, and I am an attorney with The Employment Law Group law firm.",1
"The purpose of todays video blog is to honor and celebrate Sherry Hunt, a former employee of Citigroup, who blew the whistle on hundreds of millions of dollars of mortgage fraud.",1
"As a result of Sherry Hunts brave actions, over a hundred million dollars was returned to the US treasury.",1
Tax payer fraud committed by Citigroup over a number of years.,1
What happened here is really interesting.,1
There really are three key facts that are important to know.,1
"First of all, Sherry Hunt, who was an employee of Citigroup, and her specific job was to disclose and ferret out fraud, had reported that fraud to all of her employers, all of her supervisors through the chain of command of the company.",1
"Instead of acknowledging her efforts and correcting the fraud, Citigroup kept the fraud ongoing, kept persisting and tried to bury it, and in fact, that led to Sherry Hunts ultimate demise from the company.",1
The second interesting fact here is the return of over 100 million dollars to tax payers.,1
"The fraud Citigroup committed here was involving Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government sponsored entities.",0
"You may recall, that just recently, government and the tax payers paid over 400 million dollars to bail out Citigroup, and what did Citigroup do?",1
"It committed fraud with those dollars; so at least, we have returned some money back to the tax payers and back to the US treasury.",0
The third interesting fact here is that Sherry Hunt was paid 31 million dollars for her efforts.,1
"And that may seem like, well it is a lot of money, but that may seem maybe like it seems like its too much to you.",1
entire week and I dont have to think about it again,1
"So, for me, I schedule a reminder about rehearsal on Sunday afternoons",1
On Monday morning Ive scheduled a prayer that goes out to them right before they get to school and this reminds them that Im praying for them,1
"On Wednesdays I tweet out the hashtag #wordsfromrehearsal and I use just a little snippet of music, a little snippet of text from the rehearsal that they just had",1
The hope is that theyll connect the words that weve practiced on Sunday with their life on Wednesday and beyond,1
One of the other great features about this app is the ability to communicate with a student one-on-one in a safe way,1
"So the way that remind allows me to do that is, through the app I can have a conversation one-on-one with the student, but its all saved online so theres no liability issues",1
Another great thing about remind is to be able to have group conversations,1
"Hi, Gina Schreck here with a conference tip for you.",1
I am in the beautiful Kingdom of Bahrain attending and speaking at the conference for PMI-AGC.,1
And you could see it�s just gorgeous here at the Gulf Hotel.,1
"But reminding me of a great social marketing tip for you, number one, when you collect all the business cards from folks at a conference, be sure to go back that night right away and connect with those people on LinkedIn instead of just putting a rubber band around those business cards and stuffing them in your drawer.",1
"Good morning, Hank, its Fri- Blue guys, what are you doing lyin around on the job?",0
Show some respect for my audience.,1
Thats better.,1
"So Hank, Ive been sick lately - in fact, I have a note from my doctor saying I dont have to do my punishment - but I wanted to continue our conversation about religion.",0
"But I also know that some people find that kinda boring, so heres some dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dance, dance, dance, dance!",1
"Right, so Hank, in your video on Wednesday, you pointed out how difficult it can be to answer yes or no questions like Do you believe in God? because you have to define terms like believe and God. Also, in. And that made me think about how difficult it is to define any religious identity.",1
"Like, for instance, Muslims - Muslims believe in the Five Pillars of Islam, right?",1
"You have the shahada, the belief that there is no God but God; prayer, at least five times a day.",1
Being a teacher means being a member of of one of the most honorable and rewarding professions As one of our colleagues put it so very well: When the untapped potential of a child meets the creative imagination of the teacher a miracle occurs,1
And let me tell you that most of the 60 million teachers on this planet experiences that Miracle frequently,1
"It is the source, if you will, of our passion",1
Yet the current debate on what teaching is about has been narrowed to neat measurable outcomes that are generally limited to whats testable via a series of multiple choice items,0
And teachers are held accountable for results,0
Time spend doing anything but that is considered off topic an off track,1
"Many colleagues would join teaching to make a difference in kids lives and to build learning communities are leaving the profession in droves because in too many places it is being reverted to a service delivery industry based on control, on sanctions and on compliance",1
we hear it all the time,1
"So important, we are told, that special attention must be given to recruiting the best and the brightest into the schools that need them most",1
"Again, we absolutely agree",0
"But theres a big gap between our political leaders say and the harsh reality of teachers autonomy and professional freedoms being restricted, and their rights being widely ignored",0
"&gt;&gt; Felicia Boyle: At this point, there are things that I am a little nervous about.",0
I am still trying to learn APA formatting.,0
My previous universities all used MLA and so that is one thing that I know that writing has been a little bit of an issue with the APA formatting and trying to learn that.,1
"The APA was great, getting to learn all about APA and going over some of the things in the book.",1
&gt;&gt; DAVID: I�ve always had this entrepreneurial bug.,1
So I love reading autobiographies of other entrepreneurs.,1
"Everything from Rockefeller, to Michael Dell, Bill Gates, just the whole nine yards.",1
"So in eighth grade a friend of mine gave me a book called �Teach Yourself C in 21 days.� I read this book, I was in my math class and I said why not just write some software to solve my math problems� make sure that I got the answers correct.",1
That�s really what got me hooked on using software to solve different problems.,1
"So it progressed into building websites with the dotcom boom, so I built websites for different organizations at the Duke campus.",1
"How are you doing, youre watching Expert Village, my name is Scot Ruggles and I am here to take you through what it takes to be a football coach.",1
"Once I got done playing college football, I got right into coaching, I, uh, sort of grew up around the game, my father is a long time high school and college football coach.",1
My first coaching job I started at Wagner College.,1
This is the Revision Vitam C Lotion.,1
"The Revision Vitamin C Lotion 30% is a lightweight, water-based, oil-free lotion that assists in firming and brightening the skin.",1
"&gt;&gt; Sure, theres no doubt about it.",1
"to a few religions, not to all of them, therefore it shouldn’t be part of state education",1
"To prove this, Bobby Henderson argued that he believed a supernatural Italian dinner was the world creator and that whenever a scientist tried to carbon date an object, to see how old it was, this god was there “changing the results with his noodly appendage”",1
"He said his beliefs were just as valid as Creationists, therefore should be included in the curriculum as well",1
"The idea took hold and spread around the internet and the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster has many followers, allegedly leading back to pirates, who were the original Pastafarians",1
"This is Lily Iatridis of Fortuigence with another summer writing activity for you to do with your kids or for your kids to do on their own, depending on their age level and independence with writing.",1
"Now, this idea was submitted by Susan Williams of Education Possible.",1
I want to make sure she gets credit for this.,1
Here is her idea.,1
How about having your kids write an online review of a product that they often use or know a lot about?,1
"I think that would be a fabulous idea, especially on Amazon or whatever other sites you frequently shop at online.",1
"Usually when we write a product review, for example, in our Textual Analysis Essay short course or as part of the Essay Rockstar Approach semester-long program, the first thing you have to do is to discuss and identify the purpose the author or the creator of whatever it is theyre reviewing intended, but with online reviews you kind of dont need to do that.",1
You could skip that step all together.,0
"The product description online will already give the purpose of the product, what its supposed to do, what its creator intended it to do and so on, so all your kids have to do is to sit down and think and write a review of the product that will be useful to other readers.",1
The one example that comes to mind happened during my first job out of college when I failed to meet the deadline on a draft of an article that I was working on.,0
"And it was a matter of not managing my time effectively, I was working on another simultaneous project that I prioritized and I have to say I really took that experience to heart and Ive been much more deliberate since then in how I manage my time.",1
So even though Im not glad that it happened Im grateful for the learning experience,1
"Hey guys, little channel update here and you might be wondering why is the video so shaky!",1
thats caue Im recording with my tablet and why am I doing that of all things when I clearly have the technology to do better?,0
"Well I was doing some stuff with YouTube like tutorials for better videos (creator academy) and they gave me a challenge yes they challenged me I mean its like, not they personally but you know, you know what I mean they challenged me to make my next video with my phone or my case my tablet and record the audio with your phone (tablet) so yeah.",1
"but anyway the channel update we have today is my new upload schedule you might have noticed that Ive had an upload everyday for like a solid week now and no, Im not going to keep that up I thought I could but its quality over quantity right?",1
"So Im gonna go to a two video a week upload schedule preferably Wednesday and friday although if I cant do it on a certain days (what) Ill dish it out another day but Ill try to stick to that and thats about all, but in case you havent heard, have a new editor if you still havent heard go watch some of my most recent videos, I mean heck I made a pretty big deal out of it, made like 3 or 4 videos about, that were just of my editor playing games kind of ironic if you think about it, yeah, but anyway guys thank you for watching or not watching, but if you didnt watch it, how are you gonna get this message?",1
Hi everyone!,1
"BJ Smith from The Busy Marketer coming to you from inside my podcast studio, Studio B, with another edition of Digital Marketing News for The Busy Marketer.",1
Hashtag TBMnews - The latest information on Digital Marketing that you need to know right now.,1
"I have to tell, Im very excited about all the news around social media marketing that has come out this summer.",1
Today I have 2 stories for you.,1
"The other one is from Facebook, so if you havent seen that video yet, go check out The Busy Marketer YouTube channel and you will find it right next to this video ... About Twitter tailored audiences.",1
"Yesterday, Twitter launched new tools to make it easier to create, manage and activate your tailored audiences.",1
Lets back up just a sec and talk about tailored audiences.,1
"Tailored audiences on Twitter, to over simplify it, is Twitters method of remarketing.",1
You have a script that places a cookie on your website visitors browsers or some other method of identification and Twitter matches that information to the user in their system.,1
You can then target those users with a Twitter ad.,1
Ive used myself as an example before: I have a one-on-one marketing coaching program that has a dedicated page on TheBusyMarketer.com.,1
Visitors to that page get a special cookie.,1
"I know that some people have shown interest in that particular service, but havent yet scheduled an appointment.",1
Now I can show them an ad on Twitter reminding them of the service and encouraging them to signup for it.,1
Now Twitter is stepping up their game with some new goodies to go along with their tailored audiences.,1
The first is the ability to upload your own audience.,1
"Similar to Facebook, you can export the email addresses off of your email list and upload them for Twitter to match up with their users.",1
You can do the same thing with Twitter usernames and user IDs if you collect those or with mobile advertising IDs if you have your own app.,1
You can also upload phone numbers to create a tailored audience.,1
"RAGHURAM IYENGAR: When youre bound into a contract, there is some uncertainty that you have.",1
Think about the cell phone providers today in the US.,0
"One of the big things that is going on there is that the contract plans are so complicated that you as a consumer, when youre signing up, you have absolutely no idea what final monthly fee are you going to end up with.",1
"If somehow you end up consuming less than the number of free minutes, youre fine.",1
"If you end up consuming more, youre not exactly sure how are you going to be charged.",0
A lot of it is fine print.,1
And about 50% or so of the revenue comes from this overage and underage.,1
Hello This is the first time I have ever used a flat fee MLS Realtor service Ive bought homes for sale by owner Ive sold homes by owner Ive used Realtors on both sides and as I said this is really my first experience and I couldnt be more pleased.,1
I really like the the menu service where you can go into a list of options and pick what you want.,1
I got the the scheduling service which worked out really worked out really well for me.,1
Kind of screened people ahead of time I was extremely pleased with that and probably the best feature was the upgrade for a virtual tour and they came out and did a beautiful job-the home showed really well and i got lots and lots of response  ended up selling the home through a realtor and only paid two point seven percent commission.,1
The staff was great all the time helped me with everything I needed.,1
&gt;&gt; So Im Will Swope.,1
I run sustainability for Intel.,0
And the question I want to address is dealing with the economy verse dealing with the environment.,0
"And my simple message in return is, we should never let this crisis go to waste.",1

"Once an individual becomes an employee and they are working with a progressive company and they pass their probationary period, usually an employer will encourage them to participate in a retirement plan at work.",0
"PATRICK KRAUS: For us at Pampers, its critical.",0
Some of the things that we discussed today with BabyCenter and some of the Google work thats done shows how important or how much mom relies on Search.,0
"When a mom becomes pregnant, the first place she goes is her husband, probably, or her partner, to say Im pregnant. And then the next place is probably Google to type in pregnancy or pregnancy symptoms.",1
And thats where youve got to connect.,1
There are several ways that you can recognize that you are starting to develop a hearing loss.,1
"With hearing loss it does happen in most cases very gradually, so it tends to sneak up on some people, but there are some tell tale signs.",1
"Beyond this, the job actually has few official duties and as a result, every Secretary General has interpreted it differently",0
"For instance some act as “world moderators”, which is to say, the diplomatic mediator in international disputes",1
"In fact when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was creating the UN, this is how he envisioned the Secretary General’s role",1
"One example of a “moderator”-type was Secretary General Kofi Annan, who prioritized human rights and the spread of HIV while in office from 1997 to 2006",1
"By comparison, Annan’s successor, Ban Ki Moon, has been more of an administrator-type, overseeing the UN but with little input about what its moral obligations should be",1
"Not only is the job of the Secretary General open to interpretation, but so is the appointment process",0
"A new survey released yesterday by KPMG International, titled Navigating APAs, shows that respondents believe the benefits of an APA outweigh the costs.",1
"To explore the current perceptions and experiences with APA programs globally, in-depth interviews were conducted with tax directors (or their equivalents) from 25 multinational companies in seven countries.",1
Hi this Shana Bethune on behalf of Expert Village and Im going to talk to you about image manipulation in final cut pro.,1
So lets say you are in the process of editing and you find a spot that you really like but you wish the camera have zoomed in just a little bit or maybe it is rotated to the right a little too far and you want to fix it.,1
Well here is how you do that.,1
So lets say you want this shot to be a little bit tighter than what it is here and make sure it is in the viewer and then I change my view of the clips so it is about fifty percent and over here I select image and wire frame.,1
So I can see the image and this frame around it to let me know how big it is.,0
Now I grab on to the corners here and pull it out to make it bigger and once I have it at the size that I want I can move it around like this.,1
To select the part of the shot that I want to have in the frame.,1

"The entrenched interests of Congress, and this is an indictment of both the democrats and republicans, are such that you raise money from the special interests, you give them their special little flavors and you get re-elected again and again and again.",1
Henderson: So as president what would you do to change that?,0
"Schweitzer: Well, to start with, if you look at my record in Montana, I was elected without taking a penny of special interest money.",1
I didnt take any PAC money when I was elected or re-elected.,1

Hello and Welcome My name is Robert Reierson  - President &amp; CEO of Tradex Foods.,1
Thank you for joining us for the fifth edition of The Tradex Foods 3-Minute Market Insight The Monday morning “pulse report” for seafood purchasers.,1
In news this week American consumers are showing signs of optimism.,0
It was just a year ago when middle class Americans tightened control on discretionary spending by 3.5 percent the largest single-year drop since record keeping began in 1984. But for 2010 the Consumer Confidence Index is much more optimistic consumers may still be weighed down by employment concerns but they are definitely more positive than in previous years and the impact on sales has been noticeable.,1
Casual dining restaurants reported strong sales over the summer which then carried into This upswing should fuel margin and earnings growth for many companies.,1
Improved sales at the restaurant level will funnel up the supply chain to distributors who should be targeting chains that show high foot-traffic trends AND those with pricing power those being chains that have the ability to raise prices without seeing much effect on demand.,1
In the retail sector there is also evidence of a slowly rebounding economy while 2009 was a period of discounts and low prices this year and in 2011 consumers are ready to pay a bit more BUT they want value for their money.,1
Brands cant force their way into the conversation.,1
Lots of brands would like to.,1
And thats a major mistake.,0
Because the consumer doesnt want them there.,1
Unless they choose to have them there.,1
"What Crispin Porter does, and I love this way of thinking, is they create advertising that will become part of the conversation.",1
"According to the KPMG survey, Economic Capital Modeling in the Insurance Industry, EC modeling is a way of calculating how much capital a business needs to meet its future risk.",1
It has the potential to transform the way organizations control risks and manage their businesses right across the global insurance industry.,1
"However, a survey of the worlds top insurers shows that a lack of understanding at the very top could hinder its effectiveness.",1
"DAVID BELL: Ive seen retailers that are very, very specialized, like Daves Cookies, Sophies Wine, diapers.com, bonobos.com.",1
"Companies with pretty narrow product lines, almost a single-product category, essentially be able to survive, even thrive on the internet, because they can aggregate demand out of the space.",1
"Whereas if I open a very, very focused retailer in one location, my demand typically is somewhat limited.",1
"Hi, my name is Michael Orkin and I am a television producer.",1

But it is the same for all other devices as well.,1
First you have to open your browser on the tablet Now load the url you can see inside the Video   on the bottom and/or in my video descripton Now load the url you can see inside the Video   on the bottom and/or in my video descripton Now it downloads the UpgareAndroid.apk to your tablet.,1

"No, it happened to me, it didnt happen to you.",0
"You walked in, with the air of a god on a holiday.",0
"It was I who fell, headlong, dizzy, blind... I didnt want to love you!",0
It was a force too strong for me.,0
I am only 26 years old.,1
But for 25 years of my life I was in organized church.,0
In 2004 I became a professional pastor.,0
I was paid to be a pastor.,1
I brought many people to church.,1
I discipled many people.,1
"It wasn’t until about a year ago that the Lord started to speak to me, and at one point He said to me; “ANDY who have YOU made a disciple, who is following ME because of your ministry?” I said; “Lord YOU know.",1
"Tell me who I have made disciples, You know who they are by name.” You know He didn’t tell me.",0
"In this course youll be asked to write four short Journal reflections these little Journal reflections are different than most journals in the sense that they follow the focused conversation model and so when you submit these four journals they have to be divided using headers of objective, reflective, interpretive and decisional So thats how your going to.",1
Its two pages youre probably write a half a page on each one out those four.,1
Theres no maximum length so if you really get into the topic and you want to really do a deeper dive.,0
Ive had journals come in that are eight or nine pages not recommending that but if you want to do that - you can do do that.,1
"This assignment is at 10 percent and we would like you to upload those journals one at a time, individually into the Moodle course and so this allows you to you know maybe youve got an evening.",1
These journals are based on quotes you find a quote there that really kinda speaks to you and so you can just tear right into that and write up one of those four journals in an evening during commercial breaks and then upload it into the Moodle course.,1
"&gt;&gt; Dr. Kuzon: So about relationships with patients, I think all physicians have different styles.",0
One of the nice things about plastic surgery that I enjoy is we see our patients on a repeated basis over long periods of time.,1
We dont operate on them once and then their treatment is completed and we dont see them anymore.,1
We are often doing reconstructions that take multiple stages.,1
Or theres lots of reasons we see them over long periods of time.,1
"So against that backdrop, my personal nostalgia position I think is -- honestly its quite business like.",1
I think that provides them with the best level of decision making regarding their care.,0
Plastic surgery is a poorly understood specialty by the general public.,1
I’ve long believed that relationships go bad with misaligned expectations.,1
"I’ve known Peter Winick for several years, more recently I’ve met Bill, Jessica and other members of the team.",0
"And I think the best way I can describe my work with them is that Peter quickly gets to know you and understands what makes you tick, what your priorities are.",1
"Understands that in my case this idea, these concepts have been my baby for a number of years and it’s very hard to go from a sole practitioner and steward of birthing this idea and raising it and growing it and really working hard to build a brand and deliver value to customers to now letting go.",0
"Youve recently purchased some corporate stock and youre becoming involved in following the progress and the operations of the corporation in which youve invested and youre hearing terminology that you vaguely remember maybe you heard about it in your 8th grade civics class or you read about it in the newspaper, but youre not that comfortable with the terminology and one of the phrases is corporate loyalty, duty of corporate loyalty.",1

You can use the introduction to summarize your whole projectóexcept the results.,1
&gt;&gt;Brad Anderson: I think most of the time we have spent here at Davos has been on the environment.,1
What’s clearly fueling the change in B to B marketing and marketing per se is technology.,0
"The ability to track and monitor and quickly execute digitally on what your audience and your prospects are doing, right?",1
"And it’s-- one thing that I haven’t seen yet in many marketing environments, is organizations that are set up to listen really well.",0
"Dr. Griggs first lecture reminded us that, thanks to shared water resources, were often interconnected, even though we may not recognize it.",1
"The water conflicts he touched on reflected tensions between different types of users, upstream versus downstream neighbors, users in adjacent basins connected by inter-basin transfers, users in adjacent states and in adjacent nations.",1
He showed us how solutions to these conflicts are often elusive.,0
"Not so much for lack of technology or money, but for the lack of effective governance.",1
"Holders of vast wealth and power, the monasteries could not be touched",1
"Ten years later, they were gone, and the English found other ways of being religious",1
"As Marginson points out: An important practical question, then, is: is it possible for institutions that we think are very well established, highly unlikely to change, actually to be quite fragile and unstable, is it possible that they will dissolve from one day to the next",0
One could argue that the global financial crisis in 2008 was an example of the world coming very close to that,1
"SAMEER SAMAT: In the world of retail, which is primarily where I focus, I think that theres a few big changes that are coming for advertisers that they really need to get ready for.",1
The first I think-- and the primary one that I point to-- is the connection between the online world and the offline world.,1
Historically many advertisers have thought of these as two different channels.,1
"And in fact, consumers I think less and less are thinking of them in that kind of distinct way.",1
In this clip were going to talk about how to pick a location for your convention.,1
"Hi, this is Karen Schimpf with Commercial Capital.",1
Today I am going to discuss what underwriters are looking for when underwriting a business commercial financing loan.,1
"Now, many people believe that getting a loan for commercial property depends solely on the strength of the commercial property.",1
"Well, this assumption would not be correct.",1
Lenders look at the strength of the borrower.,1
Many of the Commercial lenders determine the strength a borrower by reviewing your personal net worth.,1
Some Commercial Property Lenders use this information to determine the loan amount they will lend  and some will use this information determine if they are going to lend to you at all.,1
Numerous Commercial lenders look at your personal net worth because they will only lend you the requested amount that is either equal to or greater than you Personal Net  Net Worth.,1
Many lenders want to know your personal net worth  to find out if you are real estate heavy.,0

"There are many different kind of consumer conversational places in the marketplace, like related to customer service, product reviews in those places, that a brand can very nearly instantaneously understand the context and the intent of a customer relationships with a brand and a product.",1
"And so to not participate in those places, to not engage, not to listen, is a huge strategic mistake.",1
"But in the other side, its clearly an opportunity.",1
A product road map can be built by simply listening to the marketplace.,0
Companies that were built looking forward in the marketplace had had success in the past.,1

"And in the end, we could also be an example for them.",1
"The health and well-being of Maori children is already in dire straits, so why go there?",1
Its good to go overseas to listen and take a look at what other governments are doing to help their indigenous people.,1
Thats why theyve gone to Australia.,1

"And finally, transparency.",1
"As we partner together and really treat your brand like our own brand and have you as a partner in our client family a lot of times things will change wether its within your company, within the competitive environment looking at tactics like social media and looking at Facebook and perhaps Facebook changes its terms and the way that you could function with it.",1
"Were going to be transparent and let you know Hey this is a goal but this has changed in the environment we need to adjust sales, go around and find a different way to really meet that goal for you and we communicate transparency throughout the process of working together.",1

Patients who are African-American or Afro-Caribbean often ask can transplants work for them and if so are there differences between hair for them and Caucasian hair.,1
The answer to both is yes.,1
Hair transplants are extremely effective for patients with black skin.,1
"Ive done many, many, many transplants on these patients, and we get extremely good results, but its important to know two particular factors with African-American skin.",1
"For example, the hair is curved.",1
Its like a C shape.,1
So its important when youre cutting the graft that youre very careful at how you do that.,1
"Also, when youre transplanting them and putting them in, you have to keep in mind that they can curl a little bit easier.",1
"So while one of the benefits is you get more coverage with less number of grafts, youve got to be more particular and more skilled at how you cut the grafts.",1
"This also implies that its difficult to do this procedure on African-American patients with the FUE, where youre cutting them out one at a time, because its often difficult to see that C-shaped curve.",0

"Hi, this is Andrew Krauksts here with Australian Expat Loans, and today I just want to give you a very quick tip and share with you some ideas on a very common question that I get about foreign currency loans for Aussie Expats and Foreign Investors.",1
"I’m going to use an example of if you were to buy a property for say around $715,000, you would probably need for a foreign currency loan at least a 30% deposit.",1
That’s the minimum.,0
"For this example we’re using a 30% deposit, and then you’d probably be looking at around a $500,000 Australian home loan.",0
"I just want to go through and share with you some of the mechanics of a foreign currency loan, which a lot of people don’t really understand, especially the pro’s, but also the con’s.",1
I think most people are aware of the pro’s of getting a cheap interest rate.,1
"If you were to draw down a $500,000 home loan  – and when I say $500,000, I mean in Aussie dollars, because the purchase price of the property is going to be in Australian dollars, for this example $715,000 – the lender will convert to the foreign currency that you wish.",1
"So that $500,000 will be drawn down and then converted.",1
"Now, obviously the pro’s about it is that you’re going to get a very cheap rate compared to the Australian home loan interest rate at a fraction of the cost.",1
That’s obviously one of the reasons why we get asked a lot of questions about foreign currency loans for Australian Expats and Foreign Investors.,1
The one thing that people don’t realize is the dangers involved with a foreign currency loan.,1

That your designs must work on a lot of often very different devices.,1
"Android runs on all types of things from tiny watches to phones and tablets, even to cars and TVs.",1
This variety can be daunting.,0
The good news is that Android has been designed to handle this variety in device types from day one.,1
The platform gives you a whole bunch of tools and techniques for handling different devices easily and gracefully.,0
Your goal should be to create a single app that runs across a range of devices adapting the interface depending on what device its currently running on.,1
"As well find out throughout the course, optimizing the user experience across a variety of device screens and form factors isnt that difficult, and can actually be pretty fun.",1
Lets start by talking about the screens on all of these different devices.,1
"Hi, I’m Stevie Aquilina and I’m studying Applied Economics.",1
"I chose to study at Kingston because I was looking at different universities, but when I came to Kingston it was just a feeling I had about being at the university itself but also walking around town with everything that Kingston offers.",1
It was a whole package deal and I felt comfortable and relaxed and happier here than I did when visiting other universities.,1
"I’m currently studying Applied Economics and the best aspect of this course, for me, is that Applied Economics applies economics to real life and real modules.",1
"So you are doing a degree that you can use in every day standards with writing, presenting, speaking about it, so that’s the best part of the course for me.",1
I did study economics at school; I studied economics A Level standard.,1
However I studied it in a foreign country so when I came to England and I came to Kingston they brought me into an introductory course of economics as a module and that really helped bringing me up to the English standard of economics.,1

Hi I am Peter OGrady Today I would like to talk to you about Student Loans.,1
I think what we have to look at here is why these loans are available in the first place and can i apply for one of these unsecured loans if i have bad credit?,1
These unsecured loans are government funded and are for higher educational graduates within the UK.,1
Why are these available?,1
"Well Students are being asked to pay for their own tuition fees, normally at a cost of approximately £3000 per annum, funding is difficult for most people let alone students, so for a student to go to university and pay out of their own pocket can be very demanding on any savings they have or even their parents.",1
The government have set up these schemes to make it affordable for students to carry on their higher education and achieve their goals and ambitions.,1
So what is involved in getting funding for a graduate?,1
"When a graduate knows they have been accepted for a University, they can apply to the student loans company, when the unsecured loan has been accepted, the student can expect to receive the funds in three payments spread across the year into their bank account when the university has confirmed that the student is attending the course, because this is a government funded scheme all unsecured loans should even be accepted for people with bad credit.",1
"Everybody is invited, we will create it together",1

"Thats the first point: to believe, to trust in what we are thinking, and that we can do it",1
"And then its for me, related to direct democracy",1
Theres a lack in the world of the role of democracy: we have to renew it,1
"And then, how does it work - financially, for example - is that you can imagine, if theres an unconditional basic floor for everybody, then wages can decrease, about the [basic incomes] amount",0
"So wages and all other incomes do no longer have the task to [fund] livelihood, they no longer have this task to ensure existence",0
Thats taken over by an unconditional basic income we give each other,1

"Hi, I am Dr. Charles Grimes and I am speaking on behalf of Expert Village about how to deal with the day of your theatrical audition.",1
Timing your monologue is not a good thing to do the day of the audition or even the day before the audition.,1
It is quite possible as you run through your rehearsal process that the time you thought your monologue is going to take in performance is different from what it is right now.,1
"So, have someone with you, have a stopwatch, have a clock, and be able to time out exactly how long your beautiful, brilliant monologue takes in performance.",1
"Know that, if you are asked for one minute monologue that is going to be exactly or no more than one minute.",1
I was raised in an emotionally disturbed environment.,0
"It is a long story, but in short, this distorted environment caused me to lose myself.",1

It does mean that the forces that drive terrorism today are not sustainable over time.,1
"Young people in large numbers may be lured, brainwashed or even bribed into leaving their homes to join militant extremist groups, but the reality – at least for most – is never going to match their expectations.",1
So we should have confidence in ourselves and in the power of the values and institutions we represent.,1
The terrorists should know that we cannot be intimidated; we will not be defeated; and we will not be provoked into actions that damage our cause.,1
But confidence is no grounds for complacency.,0
"Max: In todays episode, were talking about a fundamental dilemma that prevents you from making more money and growing your business",1
"Hi there, Im Max Simon and welcome to the Big Vision Show",1
This is all about how you can reach more people and thrive financially,1
"Now, if youre having lots of dialogues lately with entrepreneurs that are striving to grow their business and what we see over and over again is this fundamental thing thats preventing you, lets say, from making more money and growing your business",1
So heres what it is,0
"First, lets start with some context",1
"So, on one side of the equation you want people to value what you do for them to buy your services, to compensate you well for them, to be hungry for it, and also to really see the value of it",1
"On the other side, you have means that you need to invest in whether its staff or mentors or technology or something else that you need in your life specifically to help you, lets say in this case, grow your business",1
"Now, heres the correlation that most people dont see",1
"Most of the time, when it comes to you investing in what you need, people look for deals",1
They ask for favors,0
They haggle around the price; they say things are too expensive,1
They just avoid working with the best people in the world,1
They avoid investing at the highest possible level,1
Now heres where this starts to connect the dots,1
"On the other side, youre wanting people to do that with you",1
Youre wanting them to invest at the highest level,1
Youre wanting them to value your work and just say yes,1
"So, all of a sudden, theres a fundamental disconnect; a misalignment at the core of everything you are doing and thats often why people wonder: Why arent people investing in a way that I want them to? So, heres two things you can do to change this dynamic not only so that it shifts energetically but so that you really become the kind of person thats walking your talk",1
"First and foremost, be willing to seek out the best in the world and work with those people",1
"Again, whether they are on your team, whether theyre mentors, or whether its a group of people, seek out the best and invest at that particular level because that not only demonstrates how willing you are to get the help that you need, but, by working with the best, it also insures that you get much better results",1
The second thing that you must do is invest in what you need,1
"Like, be willing to say: I cant do this alone; I dont have all the answers; I need more support and begin allowing your own investment to circulate out because not only on the energetic level does that shift things but, again, having that help gets you better results",1
"So, Id love to hear from you",1

"And, as always, the most advanced training happens when you are a newsletter subscriber over at bigvisionbusiness",1
"In this video Im going to talk a little bit about a problem that a lot of our prospects have been voicing to us, and this is what has happened to their rankings, and why has it happened to them? So what weve discovered over the last two years since 2011, Google has actually updated their ranking algorithm 71 times",1
What this means is that what used to work for SEO and what used to work to promote websites to get them to beat their competition no longer is helpful,1
"So, what is it that you can do to find out whats going on behind the scenes on your website to make a big difference to allow you to regain the traffic that you once had",1
There has been three major updates of the 71 updates that have made the biggest impact on the way that websites rank,0
"The first one is Panda, the second one is Penguin, and the third one is Hummingbird",1
You may have heard of these updates in the past and you may have noticed that your rankings have fluctuated a lot over the last little while,1
Panda addresses whats on your website,0
Is the quality of the content there? Is it not there? Are all your tags and everything that youre doing appropriate? The second one is Penguin,1
Penguin addresses how your website is linking to other sites and even what theyre doing,1
"So even if the content and everything is perfect on your site, it may not be perfect on the sites that you are linking to and thats going to effect your rankings as well",1
Google Analytics is a great way to address whats going on on your particular site,1
The problem is that it falls short when youre trying to address whats happening on the other sites that youre connected with,1
And the third one is Hummingbird,1
Hummingbird addresses how your website works in context with the other sites around them and in context with the words on your site,1
So if youve woven in key words on your website in a way thats not contextual accurate thats actually going to hurt you as well,1
So theres a couple of major factors that you want to take into consideration before taking your next steps,1
"You may be interested in this report if you have experienced any problems, if youre looking to invest in the near future in your SEO marketing strategy, or if youve found that you have a dip in traffic and you dont know why",1

Its going to give you a solid foundation to stand on to make sure youre getting the most of your marketing investment,1
These reports are going to give you all of the tools that you need to establish your website in the structure that it needs to be so that you can get ahead,1

"Bob: Well, welcome back everyone to Velocity Selling TV",1
"Bob Urichuck, the founder of the Velocity Selling System and I’ve got with me today a Velocity Selling Specialist and CEO of Velocity Sales Training, Matthew Whyatt, down in the Gold Coast in Australia",1
"So, join me in welcoming Matthew",1
"How are you doing Matthew? Matthew: Very well Bob, how are you? Bob: Excellent, excellent",1
"Listen Matthew, the last episode we talked about being buyer focused and we shared with our viewers the importance of the Universal needs of all buyers and how they all work, so that was great",1
And that was the first step of the three competencies that you have to master in order to get this whole buyer focused system,1
"So, one, we learned how to be buyer focused",1
The second competency is how to engage buyers,1
"Matthew, how do you engage buyers? Matthew: Well Bob, that’s a great question and that’s exactly how you engage buyers, by asking really questions",1
"Actually this is my very favourite part of the system because this has been the difference between me seeming like a normal sales person, or even anybody that follows our system, seeming like a normal sales person, being actually somebody who is actually buyer focused",1
"Now, when I run workshops, and I know that you’ve run, you’ve run tens of thousands of workshops in your time Bob, but in our time of running workshops, what we always do is we ask people why they ask questions",1
And we usually get some pretty normal answers,1
"One of the answers that I get is to learn more, to help us understand a better, what the customers need, and I even sometimes break them up into groups and have them discuss on their tables",1
"And you know, I get lots of good answers",1
"But really the one answer is the key to all of this, is for control",1
"And we’re not trying to manipulate the conversation, we’re just trying to manage the time because at the beginning of the conversation we want to understand how much time we have, what we want to achieve, and what we want to make sure that we’re trucking along in an orderly fashion to make sure the buyer actually gets what they want out of the conversation",1
"Bob: Yeah, you got it Matthew and the way I like to explain that is: the buyer feels they’re in control because we’re always working off of their questions",1
"Yet, who should be in control of the sales process? The salesperson? The small business owner? Or the buyer? So obviously it’s important that you’ve got to make the buyer feel important and that they’re in control and once they feel in control, guess what? They’re buying, you don’t have to sell them a thing",1
In the previous episode we talked about the Universal needs of buyers,1
"Matthew: And that’s to be understood, to be comfortable, to feel informed, to feel welcomed, and the only way to actually genuinely do that in your business or in a sales prescription or presentation is to ask really great, quality questions",1
Bob: You got it,1
"You know what Matthew, let’s save that one for the next episode because we’ve got so much to share with people in one area that I think it’s worth another episode",1
"So, stay tuned and we’ll get into more engaging questions on our next episode which I believe will be episode 45",1
Bob: Excellent! We’ll see you next week,1
"Matthew: See you Bob, bye-bye",1

"Please help, I only have one more shot before I lose two of the three exams that I have passed",0
"Well, time management on simulations is critical, and its a common pitfall that people run into",1
"Basically, they spend so much time on their multiple choice questions and there might be a few questions that they just cannot get over because they cant figure out the answer and so they just spend like five minutes on it, and you cant do that",0
"Especially for regulation, thats extremely important",1
The process of finding the right investor is not an easy one.,1
I think it really begins in understanding who are the investors that are going to be attracted to what you do.,1
"So, for example, you can go out and find investors that like your domain.",1
"They have invested in companies in your space, not in a competitor of yours, but in your type of technology or business.",1
"And perhaps, they would have the propensity and the interest to invest in you.",1
"So, making out that list, you can search on Angies List and CrunchBase and other free data sources out there to find those investors.",1

"The way forced labour works in the world today is very different from the way it worked in the 1930s, that its very much a private sector problem, 90% of those in forced labour are in the private sector.",1
What this study does is for the first time not only reaffirm the size and scale of the 21 million people who are involved in forced labour and victims of it -- but it also puts an economic value on that and breaks it down in a way that even a private sector company can appreciate that this encompasses many industrial sectors and accounts for about a third of the overall profits globally.,1
This has value because I can go to our supply chain and procurement people but I can also go to organisations like the Global Business Coalition against trafficking and saying this study validates why we have to work very hard on this.,0
"Whats evident is that the ILO needs to reinvigorate its action  against forced labour by coming up with a supplemental instrument that fills the implementation gaps in terms of protection, prevention and remedy for victims of forced labour so it has significant policy implications.",1
"When you have 21 million people engaged in forced labour, it will not end tomorrow but collectively, the only way it will end is if we all work together to solve the problem.",0
"When youre working with routers, youre working with firewalls, youre working with other devices.",1
One of the challenges you have is that youre providing very sensitive security information to those devices.,1
"You dont want anybody to have access to that, except for you and the other security professionals in your environment.",1
"Every device works a little bit differently on how it stores data, and how it secures data.",1
"So youll want to look at your router, or your firewall, or your switch, to determine-- how is that information stored, and how can I communicate to that device in a way thats not going to provide a lot of data in the clear that somebody might be able to see.",0
"Very often, in fact, youll find that devices on your network still have the default username and password on them.",1
Youll see this a lot for peoples home routers.,1
They dont think of changing them.,1
"Username-- administrator, login-- administrator.",1
"Its a very, very common thing, unfortunately, to see this-- even in some of the largest networks in the world.",1
"So you really have to go through and audit, make sure that you have changed all those passwords.",1
Its so quick to pass by that when youre installing a device for the first time.,1
You also have to think about how youre communicating to the device.,1

Hello and welcome to your online Sociology course.,1
My name is Mitra Hoshiar and I will be your instructor for this class.,1
Let me introduce myself and I want to give you a few tips about the course.,1

"Most the time I sometimes lie and I say that its a mix between marketing and communications because thats the easiest way how to explain it but, overall its a very broad major and Im excited to see whats going to happen in the next few years with it For my fun fact Im going to tell you about when I was in the third grade, I was featured in the film We are Marshall Which is a movie based on a true story about how the football team from Marshall was coming back from a game in Florida It was rainy and really dark that night and the plane crashed into the mountainside in Huntington, which was only a few miles from the airport",0
In 2006 producers and directors came to Marshall and filmed about how the school recovered from the plane crash and how the football team was rebuilt,0
That day I went to work with my mom and I was walking to the student center and some guy asked us if I wanted to be featured in a movie so I think any nine-year-old would have said yes and I did and she let me,1
I was in the scene whenever Matthew McConaughey was looking out the window and people were shouting We Are,1

Should victory visit Hillary Clinton’s door it shall not come bearing a mandate for a grand new vision or bold new policy direction,0
History will simply note that voters found her less objectionable than her opponent,0
"Having stuck with her, the Bernie Sanders wing of the democratic party will want its due",0
And it will be difficult for Mrs,1
Clinton to make them happy,0
"They are a populist bunch, hell bent on massive redistribution of wealth, and not interested in fighting new wars in the middle east, or another cold war with Russia",0
Clinton cannot please the Sanders wing without alienating those on Wall Street that helped pay her bills,0
She cannot pay for the Sanders wing wish list without breaking her no-new-taxes promise to the middle class,0
The Republican Party has already cracked,1
The evangelical wing has lost its moral compass and shed its credibility as the arbiter of the good and the holy,1
The establishment Wing and their neocon allies are already exiting the Republican tent,1
"The blue collar, working class wing that has been a reliable Republican voting block may soon be looking for looking for a new tent",1
"The wings of the Republican coalition are so deeply divided on entitlements, trade, immigration, when and where to fight wars that even a Trump victory will not again unite them",1
This election has laid raw the stark divisions inside the American Political parties,0

"As far as shopper marketing, and ultimately the use of digital tools in the shopper marketing process, keep your eye on Proctor and Gamble.",1
They’re always about five years ahead of everybody else in terms of how they-- how they go to market.,1
And they were the first to really exalt the retail space as what they call the first moment of truth.,1
Their chairman talks about there being two moments of truth in consumer product marketing.,1
He even calls poets liars because their representations of reality are by nature far removed from the truth,1
"However poets may try, their poetry is a poor imitation of an imitation of a reality, and so these representations are not to be valued more than Truth itself",1
"Art is dangerous because it does not portray reality as it is and because it serves the ideals of its created, so it is to be banished from Platos Republic",1
"Fortunately, another great Greek philosopher did not agree with these accusations and came to the rescue of art",1
"Aristotle, in his Poetics, tried to refute Platos argument",1
He said that poets do not claim to portray reality as it is,1
"rather, they portray reality as it should be",1
"We would hope that everyone would be able, boys, girls, little children, older people, realize that when we partake of the bread and when we partake of the water, its in remembrance of the atoning sacrifice of the Son of God",1
"Unfortunately, one year on, we have to report that the situation per young people in the labour market has not gotten better.",0
"In fact with the economic crisis proving to be much more deep rooted than initially thought, it is unlikely that the situation in the youth labour market is going to improve any time soon.",1
We have the youth in the developed economies which were hit particularly hard by the economic crisis.,1
"Here, the youth unemployment rate and the youth unemployment number in 2010 were higher than ever before measured.",0
"At the same time, the youth unemployment rate between 2009 and 2010 continued to increase, this makes the region unique.",1
"Another distinct group of young people in developing economies, here we have a very different situation because very few young people can afford to be unemployed.",1
So the youth unemployment rate is not the indicator to focus on here.,1
"Rather we talk about working poverty, we talk about vulnerable employment.",0
"Most young people take up whatever work is available to them, often time very poor working conditions and at poverty wages.",0
Part-time employment for example has sky-rocketed in recent years.,1
Now part-time employment in itself is not necessarily a negative thing especially when young people are combining work and studies.,0
However the recent magnitude of the increase hints at the fact that part-time employment has been taken up as an involuntary action.,0
Many young people are finding that they can only find part-time and temporary employment.,0
Sustained investments in young people are what we need now more than ever.,1
Long-term investment in the education and training system for example; Creative fiscal policy that will subsidize youth employment; these are some of the examples of the solutions that are being called for.,0
- The great majority of students have debt when they graduate from college.,0
"The average for a student going to a public school is about $26,000 of debt.",0
"For a private school its around $29,000 of debt.",0
"- Taking out loans to pay for your education is a highly, highly, personal decision making process.",1
And it gets complicated because I think families tend to advise students and sometimes that advice is very helpful and other times its kind of antagonistic because it just adds another pressure that you have to keep in mind.,1
"And sometimes the pressure is to take out loans because no one has money right now, or in other times its were not taking out any loans because we have no money to pay it back.",0
"Which might mean that if youre not going to take out loans, you need to pay everything right now.",1
"Which means you might have to work a whole lot more, somehow, in order to pay for your education.",1
And so my biggest advice is to think very practically about can you actually pay back those loans?,0
- Always have an understanding of what is your overall indebtedness.,1
I see students get into trouble because they just keep taking out loans every year and then its a big surprise for them at the end of four years how much they owe.,1
"So you should know how much youve borrowed, you should know what that means in terms of monthly payments when you graduate.",0
Whats the dollar amount that youre going to be responsible for?,1
And have an understanding of basic budgeting.,1
What does that mean in terms of what will your lifestyle need to be when you graduate.,0
So dont just take out those loans blindly.,1
"Know what the monthly payment obligation is going to be, what that means for you once youre out in the world of work.",1

At this point youve likely reached out to my office and you may very well have your first consultation set up with my firm,1
"At that consultation or case evaluation, youll either be meeting with myself or a trusted member of my team",1
The meeting will be entirely confidential,1
What you say to us will not leave our office,1
"If youre referred to us by another attorney or a friend of the firm, we will not share your information with that other attorney or that referral source in any way, shape, or form without your permission",0
"The purpose of the consultation and case evaluation is for you to come to the office, for you to feel if youre comfortable with us, and for us to feel if were comfortable with you moving forward",1
"In all likelihood, were gonna want to discuss what you believe happened, what you believe the police reports will say, what you believe the alleged victim, if there is a victim in this case being alleged would say if we were there interviewing them, and we want you to bring a couple of things to that meeting",1
"One is, first and foremost, we want you to bring an open mind because we know that people have certain preconceptions or misconceptions about attorneys and attorneys offices when charged with a crime",1
So once you come in there understanding that our job is to evaluate and get as much information as possible,1
"So we ask that you dont be reluctant to give us that information, because we need that information in order to evaluate the case, to quote a fair and accurate fee for our services",1
"When you come into the office, we ask that you bring any bail paperwork you have",1
"If youve been arrested, you should have a bail slip, which will show your bail amount, the charges you were booked into jail at, as well as any future court dates",1
"If you have a citation from a traffic ticket or something like that where you were cited and released, wed ask that you bring that",1
"If you happen to have your discovery, police reports, all that information",1
"If you case is currently ongoing, then wed ask that you bring that or send a copy to our office in advance of your meeting so we can be most prepared when you come in and meet with us",1
"And what youll find is when you meet with either myself or a staff member, is that we may not be the cheapest",1
"I guarantee you, were not going to be the cheapest attorney youre probably going to meet with",1
We might not be the most expensive,1
"We might be, I dont know",1
"But what I can guarantee you is youre going to be handled with class, youre going to be handled with professionalism, and thats nothing pretty much less than what you should expect when interviewing with a criminal defense attorney or their firm",1
We look forward to having you come into our office for a free consultation,1
There is no obligation to that consultation,1
"If you hire us, fantastic",1
I look forward to representing you and working with you in the future,1

GRANDPRE: Jury selection was really interesting.,1
The defense actually used all six of their strikes on black people.,1

Which conforms to many peoples fears that young men of color may be seen as biased against the police and therefore be excluded from the trial.,0
"Now, the actual demographic from the jury represented Baltimore.",0
"Two-thirds black, one-third white.",1
We obviously dont know any of the details of the individuals in particular.,0
"I do think the strike pattern of the defense, though, is the big story of the jury selection, while the defense--or the prosecution, excuse me, used their strikes on a diversity of folks, the defense only used their strikes on black folks, predominantly younger black folks.",1

"If you are going to be more aggressive and you go into the massage therapist and say, I want a sports massage, use your elbows, really dig into the tissue",1
Then you are going to go ahead and look into something more firm and aggressive like the Pro Series,1
"Now there are some inbetween there, and I put together a nice little chart to help you decide which density is best for you",1

"If you are somebody that is just sitting on a chair using the Rollga, you are going to want something a little more firm, or if you are using the wall, technically if you are leaning against a wall you are going to want more pressure because you are using less body weight",1
Now if you are new to foam rolling I would suggest starting with something more soft and progressing your way up to something more firm,1

"Im Burns Phillips, commissioner of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development.",1
Two years ago we began a journey to completely overhaul Tennessees forty year old unemployment insurance system so that we might improve our serve employers and deliver unemployment benefits to claimants.,1
Its nearly complete.,1
The new system or run through the Job4TN.gov website.,1
"Soon youll be able to go online and handle your claimant responses, as well as any protest or appeals processes.",1
Now your company will have to register with Jobs4TN.gov in order to use this new system.,1
Rest assured weve taken many safeguards to keep your information confidential.,1
Another change will impact companies who have employees on partial layoff.,1
Those employees will need to register at Jobs4TN.gov and go online each week to certify that they are still out of work.,1
"Now, thats a change it will take some getting used to, but were here to help through all this.",1
Were working around the clock to make sure to smooth transition.,1

"- [Announcer] And now, a Citizens National Bank Newsletter Extra",1
"- Citizens National Bank has always offered Farm Service Agency guaranteed lending, but recently we became a preferred lender with them, which allows us to speed up the approval process",1
"Prior to that, it took us thirty days for an approval through the FSA, but now we can do it in four days",1
What were required to submit now is a one page application and a narrative,1
"If we can get two or three years of annual statements, that would be great",1
"Three years of tax returns, so we can kind of average out what the income numbers are",1
"And the different types of loans that we can offer with this are Farm Ownership loans, Operating lines of credit, or Equipment and Capital Improvement needs loans",1
"The benefit to the borrower also allows us on the real estate transactions to offer them a long term real estate loan thats fixed on the rate, different terms that we have now, we can fix a rate up to thirty years",1
"Where prior to that, typically, wed lock a rate in for a borrower for five years",1
"You know the benefit to that would be that they can mitigate any interest rate risk by locking in and knowing where their payments will be for ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five years up to thirty",1
"Other than the Farm Service Agency loan programs, other options that we have started or are involved with would be through the Farmer Mac Program",1
They basically have two,1
"Theres a Farmer Mac Two which coincides with the Farm Service Agency, thatll give us a fixed rate on their program",1
They also offer a Farmer Mac One,1
"And the Farmer Mac One is available to any borrower and even if you are a investor owning property and you want to have an option of having a fixed rate on your real estate, we can take you through the Farmer Mac One program and lock that rate in",1
Another option that we have through the Farm Service Agency is the Beginning Farmer program,1
And this really allows for a family farm operation to transition real estate from one generation to the next,1
The way this works or the structure would be that the bank would finance 50% of the deal on our normal terms,1
Farm Service Agencys portion would be financed for 20 years and currently the rate on that would be 1,1
The borrower then needs to come up with 5% or have a 5% injection into the process,1
"The loan limit with the Farm Service Agency is $225,000",1
And the balance of it then can be done with bank funding,1
"To learn more about these programs, visit our Farm Services under the business section of this website",1
"Or you can give one of us a call at any of the branches that we have, or stop in and see us",1
"a sigh, nor a thought tainted with the slightest flavor of unhappiness or discontent",1

Tell us more.,0
"Well, I dont see whats controversial about it Howard.",1
"I just sincerely believe that somebody, probably the Institute of Fundraising, should put aside some budget and launch a media campaign saying we are proud to be fundraisers.Theres been so much negative press and offset against that the evidence is that when an entire organisation is proud of its fundraising, it raises more money.",1
"Weve got so many people defending, controlling, attacking fundraising that weve become defensive and apologetic and there is nobody out there in the media or talking to trustees and chief executives saying actually, were very, very good at this.",1

"The response and impact of those advertisers that have started to engage in on line media to measure their-- the results of that, has been really positive.",1
"Overall I think we are pretty clear that this has been a major step forward for the teaching of this course, and it was a big success.",1
"I mean, firstly we had the students reactions which was overwhelmingly positive.",1
"We also had exam data that we could analyse, and we able to do proper statistical analysis of this, comparing it with exam data from the three years previously, and what weve found, where we controlled the differences among these students, differences in the difficulties of the exams, we found that weve had something like five marks to the average grade of a student, which is quite a big increase, I mean, its half of the degree class, if you like.",1
So that was really a positive thing.,1
"But even if you dont believe the exam data that we had, we saw the engagement significantly improved.",1
"I mean, the attendance was so much better throughout the year, and in fact because the attendance was higher and we were asking students to go to twice as many classes, what we found was that over the year students had attended something like three times more classes, of this small problem classes, than they used to.",0

Welcome to the ManageMyFatigue app v1.3 update.,1
Can you believe the app has been out for almost three months now!,1
We continue to make improvements based on our original roadmap and your feedback.,1
Were very excited about the v1.3 feature updates.,1
"Its obvious that the ManageMyFatigue app is a culmination of many ideas, the original concept and the amazing feedback and suggestions from you.",1
I hope youll join me for just a moment to check out the latest features.,1
The first thing youll notice are the visual changes.,1
Weve flattened the buttons and added more contrast so the app is visually more appealing.,1
We also added a direct link to the training videos.,1
"If you havent checked them out, you might want to because they include some helpful information on using the ManageMyFatigue app.",1
Weve heard your requests and have made some changes to the More screen.,1
Youll note there is now a place to add prescription medications.,1
"You certainly dont have to include this information, but many of you have requested this feature.",1
This information is available to you in the Prescription Meds screen and also in the Bedtime Questionnaire.,1
"This way you can check your med list before you answer the, Did you take your prescription medication today? question.",1
Since were on the Bedtime Questionnaire I should mention that weve added a question about napping- How long did you spend napping today in total?,0
Thanks to those of you who requested this addition.,1
Naps are very common and should be considered when evaluating your day.,1
Weve also made a change or two  to the Settings options.,1
Youll note weve included a Soft reminder sound option and you can now tap each sound option to hear it before you choose it.,1
We also created a custom vibrate pattern for iPhone users.,1
"If the ManageMyFatigue app is the active app -  meaning that it appears on the screen when the screen is illuminated,  the vibrate pattern will be four short bursts to help you recognize that the ManageMyFatigue app is alerting you.",1
We also set the default calendar options to Enabled so your attempted tasks will automatically appear in your calendar.,1
You might wonder how should I be prepared for the day of my hearing,1
"What are some of the things I can do to be the most prepared on the day of the hearing? Well, the first thing is wear comfortable clothes",1
Do not wear something that is constricting to you or that youre uncomfortable with whatever your everyday clothes are,1
Thats what you should wear to the hearing,1
"This isnt a job interview, you dont need to dress up, go as you do everyday",1
"Jeans are perfectly fine at hearing, sweats are perfectly fine",1
"What you should not do is wear something that its extremely short or wear a lot of jewelry, a lot of makeup",1
Other than that you should be fine,1
Make sure you arrive early,1
One of the biggest complaints I hear from judges are these people are waiting more than 2 years for hearing and then they are late to their hearing,1
"Make sure well in advance that you know the route that youre going to travel, that if you need a ride that you have lined up a ride, and if youre riding on mass transit that you know what the schedule is so you should arrive at hearing an hour before your hearing",1
"If you arrive an hour before that lets you be familiar with the hearing office itself, it lets you calm down, usually people are anxious the day of hearing and youll be prepared to testify",1
The next thing you should do if you take medication ordinarily make sure youve taken your medication prior to your hearing,1
"For example, if you suffer from chronic pain you want to be able to concentrate and focus on what the judges asking you at your hearing and you want to be as comfortable as possible",1
Another thing you should do is do not be afraid to ask the judge to change positions if you are uncomfortable,1
"If you need to stand because youre in a lot of pain all you do is ask the judge respectfully, Your Honor, do you mind if I stand? If you need to stretch your legs or prop your legs on a chair they will allow you to do that",1
Just ask the judge first prior to adjusting your position,0
Dont be afraid to take a break,0
It is very important if you need to take a restroom break that you do so because of youre concentrating on the fact that you need to go to the restroom as oppose to the questions the judge is asking you might answer a question in a way that you ordinarily would not answer because you cannot concentrate and focus upon the questions the judge is asking,1
"And finally, be candid, be frank and answer the judges questions truthfully",1
Do not be evasive,1
You want to give the judge your best testimony on the date of your hearing,1

Lets check out the lab,1
We decided to take a systems approach,0
Were using the most efficient thermoelectric materials available today that have the unique combination of low thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity typically not found in nature,1
Weve paired that up with a thermal design that efficiently moves heat from your body to the environment,1
"Finally, were using a boost converter to take small thermoelectric voltages to usable levels, that only became available in the past few years",1
"Weve done the hard engineering necessary to put all this technology into the watch that youre backing, but were not stopping there",1
"Were working on the most advanced earth-abundant materials, even better thermal designs, and boost converter circuits that are even more efficient than whats available today",1

Hey guys whats up welcome to rock gamer your one stop shop for all things Rock Band 4 and Guitar Hero Live related so i want to talk about some of the new rock band news that came out today.,1
IGN did a featureette Now if youve played the past Rock Band and Guitar Hero games then youll know that the career mode was really more of an afterthought.,1
Youd play it once and then you would never return to it because it was the same experience.,1
Rock Band 4 hopes to change that.,1
In Rock Band 4 they really want to give you the option of how to become a successful band.,1
They want you to dictate that story.,1
"If you want to do the corporate gigs and make a lot of money and be a bunch of sellouts you can totally do that or you can just choose to do a different route you know play smaller venues, you know sleep on peoples couches and just interact with people over social media and manage that whole aspect so that is a really cool thing they are going to be changing up.",1
So you can play the career mode multiple times and have a different experience each time and play different gigs each time.,1
"The other thing that is really cool is that the money system is returning so you can use money to buy new instruments, you can use it to upgrade your characters appearance buy clothes that kind of accessories the other thing thats going to be changed is how fans work.",0
If you played rock band 3 then youll know that fans had no impact on gameplay.,1
This time they are going to have an impact on the gameplay.,0
So the number of fans you basically accumulate can be geographic specific so you maybe playing on the eastern seaboard or on the east coast and you may find that playing in different locations will unlock certain gigs and easter eggs which is a really cool idea.,1
I think its really important for everyone to understand that here at the University there can be no tolerance for sexual violence of any kind.,1
"We have a particular concern with what happens to survivors of sexual violence and that they should have the easiest, most respectful way to find support in the University.",1
"And so the protocol and the website that have been developed are an important addition to our practice of dealing with cases of this sort, and to trying to eliminate and wherever necessary address the concerns of people who have survived sexual violence of one sort of another.",1
"If we put ourselves in the place of a survivor and think about what we would want, we would want respect for our concerns, confidentiality, a value-free response to what has gone on, and a clear effort to provide the supports and services that we might want.",1

"PI Financial expects revenue to grow 37% for the full year of 2013, and 23% for 2014. A significant growth constraint for this market is access to equipment and labour and Macro is in an enviable position with respect to both these variables.",1
"Analyst Jason Zandberg stated, Given Macros revenue and earnings growth profile we believe Macro shares are still significantly undervalued.",1

"- Its Amanda from Derma Clinics and the topic for today is, what is an esthetician and why does everyone need one? So estheticians are skin therapists with a specific knowledge and understanding of advanced treatments and proper skincare recommendations",1
So why do you need one? Well the answer is simple,1
"Its so easy to get lost in what seems like an endless pool of options when it comes to what skincare to use, and what treatments you should be having to fix your skin",0
"So the first step in getting a little bit of clarity on this topic, is getting your skin analysed and having a proper consultation with an esthetician",1

"CASSIE MOGILNER: In general, consumers believe or perceive nonprofits to be more warm and not particularly competent.",1
"On the other hand, they perceive for-profits to be competent but not particularly warm.",0
And whats interesting is to see how these perceptions play out in marketplace behaviors.,1
Across the studies weve found that its perceptions of competence and not warmth that drives consumers willingness to purchase.,1
"Now thats a bummer certainly for nonprofits who are not necessarily less competent, but just as perceptions are driving that.",1
So then we were looking at are there ways that you can increase perceptions of competence amongst nonprofits.,0
And indeed there are.,1
"So we found, for instance, if you receive an endorsement from The Wallstreet Journal and another credible source, that by boosting perceptions of competence for nonprofits, making them on par with their perceptions of warmth, that you actually elicit admiration.",1
And then that actually trumps just competence alone in terms of purchasing.,1

"I think what you’re seeing in the technology space today is if you look back 20 years, there tended to be dominant players in certain categories and the product was so differentiated and there was such a huge wide gap from the bottom of the category to the top of the category in terms of performance, speeds, screen sizes, memory, does it have a DVD player, reader or not?",1
"And as in any category, as that consolidates and the gap closes from the top to the bottom, and the products become more similar as technology advances so far, marketing plays a much, much bigger role and other things that you bring to it.",1
And you want to set the tone that you have confidence in that persons ability to improve,1
"Step seven, you want to document the performance counseling conversation",1
"And that will vary from company to company, so whenever you have some kind of performance counseling conversation, its best to check in with human resources first, find out what kind of documentation, if any, that they would like",1
"And the reason that documentation is really important is it may become very important if you decide you want to maybe reassign that employee to a different role or you want to put them on a corrective action plan, or potentially even terminate employment",1
"So again, thats likely to be company-specific, but again its important that you just consult with your HR department",1
